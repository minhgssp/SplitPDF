After hav-\ning several very stressful years that made medical school look easy,I came down with \ufb01bromyalgia, myofascial pain syndrome, andchronic fatigue syndrome (CFS). This gave me \ufb01rsthand experiencewith widespread muscle pain. It also gave me an enormous incen-tive to learn how to overcome these problems. Having widespreadachiness was dif\ufb01cult, but it taught me an enormous amount. Ilearned how a tight muscular knot (trigger point) in one area cancause pain and tenderness elsewhere in the body. I also found thattight muscles can cause other apparently unrelated symptoms likenausea, acid re\ufb02ux, and diarrhea. It was quite an education!\nSeveral other experiences broadened my \u201cpain horizon\u201d dra-\nmatically. During my medical residency in 1979, I was working\nin the outpatient clinic. We would all cringe when one of thepatients, an ornery, hunched-over elderly woman, came in. Shewas always in severe back pain, and no one could help her. Dur-ing one of her visits, she told me that when she pushed on a lumpon her back that was about a foot away from her discomfort ittriggered her pain. I mentioned this to my instructor, Dr. JohnStuckey, and his eyes lit up. He said, \u201cWatch this,\u201d and with asmile he injected the lump with a little lidocaine (Novocain). Thewoman was able to stand up straight, pain free for the \ufb01rst time inyears. Without the chronic pain, she was the sweetest person youcould imagine!\nAt that time I had no idea why this had worked, but I rapidly\nlearned about doing trigger point injections. Several years later,after reviewing thousands of research studies and attempting many\nxi\nCopyright \u00a9 200 6 by Jacob  Teitelbaum . Click here for terms of use.  ", "experiments to ease my own discomfort, I had developed an effec-\ntive metabolic approach to treating muscle pain. Despite being aninternist I had, by default, become the pain specialist in town.\nI soon found out that other doctors had also discovered simi-\nlar principles of pain management. T wo of these spectacular physi-cians, Dr. Janet Travell and Dr. David Simons, had written a book,which a patient of mine gave me, called The Trigger Point Manual .\nIn it, the authors had long before documented the concepts that Ihad thought I had discovered. Dr. Travell was a professor atGeorge Washington Medical School and the White House physi-cian for Presidents Kennedy and Johnson. She has since passed on.Dr. Travell and Dr. Simons are the \u201cgrandparents\u201d of modernpain management. Their book expanded the understanding oftreatment dramatically for pain specialists. They also laid the foun-dation for your getting well!\nYou Are Not Alone in Your Pain\nChronic pain is a very common problem affecting millions ofAmericans. In a 1999 American Pain Society survey, 9 percent ofthe American adult population was found to suffer from moder-ate to severe non\u2013cancer-related chronic pain. Fifty-six percentof these had suffered for over \ufb01ve years. When the researchersreviewed 805 chronic pain patients, they found that over half ofthem had changed doctors because their physicians were unwill-ing or unable to adequately and appropriately treat their pain.\nIn addition to the ways in which it devastates people\u2019s lives,\nchronic pain is one of the most expensive medical conditions inthe United States. The price tag, including loss of productivity,loss of income, and medical costs, exceeds $100 billion annually.Over $61 billion is lost in productive work time because of pain,even if the person is able to work. Our track record for treatingcancer-related pain is equally devastating. The American CancerSociety estimates that an enormous number of advanced cancerpatients suffer from inadequately treated chronic pain.INTRODUCTION\nxii", "However, the \ufb01nancial costs pale in comparison to the suffer-\ning and loss of personal relationships, functional ability, and evenlength of life, as well as the depression and anxiety caused bychronic pain. The good news is that most chronic pain can now be\neffectively treated . Unfortunately, most doctors have not yet been\ntrained in proper pain management. However, this does not meanthat you have to wait to get relief. This book has been written togive you and your physician the information you need so that youcan be pain free now and get your life back.\nGood News for Chronic Pain Sufferers\nI can summarize most of what I was taught about pain in medicalschool in one paragraph. Use Tylenol and/or Advil family medica-tions. If the patient has cancer, you can use narcotics if you haveto. Were I a surgeon, surgical options might be added. I was giventhe impression that chiropractors, and anyone else who offeredsomething that wasn\u2019t taught in medical school, were quacks try-ing to steal people\u2019s money and that physicians needed to protectgullible patients from them. Although this may seem like a sadassessment, I suspect that most of you who have chronic pain willagree with it. Many physicians reading this book will also \ufb01nd thatthis mirrors their experience.\nThe good news is that you don\u2019t have to be in pain anymore!\nThe use of both natural and allopathic (prescription) medicine dra-matically increases our ability to help you get well. Although bothallopathic and natural medicines have their weaknesses, when youcombine them, almost all pain can be effectively treated. It\u2019s thedifference between having only one tool\u2014say a hammer, whichis like allopathic medicine\u2014or a whole tool kit that includes thedozens of other healing arts available in natural medicine. A ham-mer can be a very useful tool, but unfortunately when all you haveis a hammer, everything starts to look like a nail! It\u2019s much easierto get the job done safely and effectively when you are using allthe tools available to you.INTRODUCTION\nxiii", "Doctors are usually better at treating acute, short-lasting pain\nsuch as that from injuries or surgery because they are better ableto \ufb01nd the source of the pain and are more comfortable usingavailable treatments on a short-term basis. Treating chronic painproblems such as \ufb01bromyalgia and myofascial/muscle pain, can-cer pain, arthritis, headaches, back pain, and nerve pain is more ofa challenge for physicians.\nClosing the Gap Between Allopathic and \nNatural Medicine\nThere seems to be much confusion and con\ufb02ict over whether nat-\nural or prescription medicines are the best. On one hand, thereare those who claim that pharmaceuticals are the new panacea foreverything, while natural remedies are unregulated, unproven,and ineffective forms of snake oil. On the other hand, there arethose who say that surgery and prescription medications arehighly toxic and too expensive. They claim that we should onlyuse natural medicines and point out their safety record. How arewe to make sense of all this confusion?\nI choose to keep the best of both systems. Over the decades,\nI\u2019ve often had to struggle with the perceived con\ufb02ict betweenthese two wonderful and powerful branches of the healing arts.When we examine these systems closely, however, there is nocon\ufb02ict between them. Complementary and alternative medicine\n(CAM), or natural therapies, offer the vast variety and power thatnature brings to healing through herbs, nutrition, and energy/spirit. Using a mix of intuition, experience, and science\u2014like amother taking care of her child\u2014it is most interested simply inwhat works and what is safe. This results in it being very open-minded and accounts for its current rapid growth.\nAllopathic medicine focuses largely on that which is patentable.\nIt mainly deals with prescriptions and can sometimes use the pow-erful tools of science to develop effective new remedies. Scienti\ufb01cdebate within the medical community can be very useful for sort-ing out what works and dealing with things that the scientistsINTRODUCTION\nxiv", "believe in, such as prescriptions. Allopathic medicine, however, is\nmuch too biased to be objective when it comes to evaluating nat-ural remedies. For example, if given the power to regulate naturalmedicines, the FDA would likely regulate them out of existence.Because of this, Congress appropriately protects natural products.\nAlthough natural therapies have their strengths, they also have\ntheir shortcomings. One of these is quality control. Where anallopathic medication has to go through stringent testing forpotency and purity, natural remedies are viewed as foods and donot have adequate regulation. Because of this, many products havelittle or none of the potency they claim to have and therefore,although cheap, do nothing. Because this is a major problem, I amvery picky about which products and companies I recommend.For example, two natural products companies, Enzymatic Ther-apy and Integrative Therapeutics/ITI, have voluntarily registeredwith the FDA as pharmaceutical companies, which means theirproducts have the same quality control as prescriptions. In time,Congress will recognize that quality control regulation is neededfor all natural products, but hopefully will put it in the hands ofpeople who are knowledgeable and open-minded about them.\nI simply propose that you use the best of both systems. T o\nmake this easier for you, and to maintain objectivity, I have a pol-icy of not taking money from any companies (natural or pharma-ceutical) whose products I recommend. In addition, for theproducts I make, 100 percent of my royalties go to charity. There\u2019snothing wrong with money. I simply don\u2019t want it to get in theway of your getting well!\nHow This Book Can Help You\nIn Part I, I will begin by brie\ufb02y reviewing the purpose of pain andthe general principles of pain relief. I will then discuss the differ-ent types of pain in Part II. By knowing the type of pain that youhave\u2014nerve, muscle/ligament/tendon/bone, arthritic/in\ufb02amma-tory, and so on\u2014you can tailor your treatment approach to makeit more effective, and your ability to make the pain go awayINTRODUCTION\nxv", "increases dramatically. I will also discuss the most common causes\nof pain\u2014such as headache, back pain, pelvic pain, and so on\u2014andhow to effectively treat them. For some readers, the pain is wide-spread. For others, it is localized. For most kinds of pain there aregeneral principles that are helpful for healing. These are especiallyimportant for myofascial (muscle and tendon) pain, but are impor-tant for most other pain conditions as well. In Part III, I teach youboth natural and prescription approaches that can help the pain goaway and discuss the pros and cons of each, enabling you to makethe best use of all available treatments. Mind-body issues are alsoreviewed, as well as related problems that can be associated withand caused by pain such as sexual dysfunction, depression, andweight gain.\nAppendix A describes additional useful information found on\nmy website, vitality101.com. This includes more detailed discus-sions of the topics covered in each chapter. Appendix B offershelpful resources for \ufb01nding a physician, supplies and services, andtools and products that can help you get well. T o help your doc-tor become more comfortable with the treatments in this book,Appendix C gives reference information that supports thesetreatments.INTRODUCTION\nxvi", "PART I\nGeneral Principles \nof Pain Relief\nBasically, there are two main principles of pain relief. First, you want\nto supply your body with what it needs for healing and tissue repair.These critical areas include optimum nutrition (often well beyondRDA levels), eight to ten hours of deep sleep each night, and opti-mal hormonal levels (simply having a hormonal blood test be \u201cnor-mal\u201d may not be adequate). The second principle is that you wantto treat or eliminate things that stress your body and cause pain(which include infections; toxins such as chemicals and heavy met-als; in\ufb02ammation; mechanical stresses on the body; excessive situa-tional, psychological, or physical stresses; and abnormal tissuecompression such as that caused by cancers). In these next few chap-ters, I will outline these critical areas and triggers so you can getstarted on the right path toward pain relief.\n1\nCopyright \u00a9 200 6 by Jacob  Teitelbaum .

Y ou may have received little relief from currentmedical approaches. In fact, you may not even know what is caus-ing your pain.\nPain Free 1-2-3 will teach you how to determine the cause of\nyour pain and how to make it go away. Although an enormousamount of new research is emerging on the complex biochemistryof pain\u2014and this information helps when creating new approachesfor pain relief\u2014dazzling you with this dif\ufb01cult biochemistry is notmy goal. My purpose is to give you the information that you needto give your body what it needs and help you move forward so youcan get a life that you love.\nWhile I won\u2019t give all of the thousands of research studies and\nreports that this book is based on, I will give some references thatI think your doctor (or you if you have a scienti\ufb01c interest) will \ufb01ndhelpful (see Appendix C). For areas of special interest to you, moredetailed technical information can be found on my website underthe Pain Free 1-2-3 \u201cNotes.\u201d For now, let\u2019s start with the basics.\nWhat Is Pain?\nThe International Association for the Study of Pain de\ufb01nes pain\nas \u201can unpleasant sensory and emotional experience associated 3CHAPTER1\nCopyright \u00a9 200 6 by Jacob  Teitelbaum . Click here for terms of use.  ", "with actual or potential tissue damage or described in terms of\nsuch damage.\u201d Y ou don\u2019t need such a c omplex de\ufb01nition, how-\never. Y ou know pain when you feel it.\nPain can be divided into two basic categories: acute pain and\nchronic pain. Acute pain, which usually results from tissue injury,in\ufb02ammation, or illness, often occurs suddenly after surgery orinjury. Usually doctors can \ufb01gure out what caused it, and it goesaway on its own or with treatment. Chronic pain, on the otherhand, can last for many years and is poorly treated medically.Chronic pain is the main focus of this book, although acute painwill also be addressed.\nThe Critical Function of Pain\nAlthough chronic pain can be devastating, pain serves a criticalfunction. It is a warning system for your body. Pain tells you whenyou need to avoid something so you do not cause damage to your-self. In addition, pain tells you when your body is not gettingwhat it needs\u2014sleep, nutrients, oxygen, and so on. For example,there is a genetic disease called hereditary sensory and autonomicneuropathy, or HSAN. People who suffer from this disease areborn without any ability to feel pain. Y ou may think this wouldbe wonderful, but it is not. These people die very young and crip-pled. If a sufferer of this disease breaks a leg, he has no pain andstill tries to walk, causing further damage. If his hand is on a hotstove, he does not know it until he smells something burning.\nPain is not the enemy. It is an important warning system. But\nwhen pain goes out of balance and becomes chronic, it may end upcausing more harm than good. Therefore, in addition to teachingyou how to turn off the pain signal, I will also help you understandwhat pain is trying to tell you about what your body needs.\nHow Do I Turn Off the Pain Signal?\nY ou turn off the pain by giving your body what it needs and byeliminating what is damaging or toxic to your body. For example,GENERAL PRINCIPLES OF PAIN RELIEF\n4", "one of the most common types of pain is muscle or myofascial\npain. The medical profession very poorly understands this type ofpain. Although we might think that muscles will go limp if theydo not have what they need, consider rigor mortis. When some-one dies and the muscles are not getting what they need, they donot become loose\u2014in fact they become stiff as a board. If yourliving muscles do not have adequate nutrients, optimal hormonelevels, or enough sleep for tissue repair, they will get stuck in theshortened position and cause pain. Underlying infections can alsocause your muscles to get stuck in the shortened position. Pain isyour body\u2019s way of saying that these problems need to beaddressed. Y ou\u2019ll be amazed at how pain that has lasted decadescan go away quickly when these problems are taken care of. Wewill discuss this in more depth in Chapters 2 and 3.\nOften, \ufb01nding the right medication for pain is like trying on\ndifferent shoes to see which \ufb01ts the best. In the current medical\u201cshoe store\u201d there are one or two pairs to try on. If these few\u201cshoes\u201d don\u2019t \ufb01t, you are out of luck. Fortunately, there are actu-ally many dozens of treatments to try, and when one doesn\u2019t \ufb01tanother often will.\nIn addition, pain management is a perfect place to combine tra-\nditional and c omplementary therapi es. The dif\ufb01culty that patients\nhave in \ufb01nding doctors that can effectively treat their pain is driv-ing them to alternative healers in droves. In fact, according to theJournal of the American Medical Association , pain is the number one\nreason why people use alternative medicine, which includes chi-ropractic, naturopathic medicine, acupuncture, biofeedback, mas-sage, Reiki, meditation, and other techniques. Often, it is dif\ufb01cultto treat chronic pain with a single \u201cmagic bullet.\u201d It takes a prac-titioner who is knowledgeable about many treatment modalitiesand who is also a compassionate listener.WHY WE HAVE PAIN\n5", "This page intentionally left blank ", "Giving Your Body \nWhat It Needs to \nHeal Your Pain\nThis chapter explains how to optimize nutritional support, get\nadequate sleep, and address hormonal de\ufb01ciencies. Pain often willnot go away until each area of the body\u2019s need is adequately han-dled. For example, it may surprise you to know that nutritionaland hormonal de\ufb01ciencies and/or fungal infections (usually sec-ondary to antibiotic use) can aggravate neuropathic or back pain.Because of this, it is a good idea for you to read this entire chap-ter, as I outline a simpli\ufb01ed approach for making sure that all ofthe key principles for treating your pain are addressed.\nIt is important not to forget that some simple general princi-\nples and lifestyle issues are critical to the treatment of chronicpain. For example, exercise daily for at least twenty minutes ifyou\u2019re able. Swimming, walking, and yoga are good choices.\nOptimizing Nutritional Support\nThe American diet is awful. In fact, it is often called the \u201cstandardAmerican diet,\u201d or SAD, and the initials are appropriate. The aver-age American\u2019s diet includes 150 pounds of added sugar per year,CHAPTER2\n7\nCopyright \u00a9 200 6 by Jacob  Teitelbaum . Click here for terms of use.  ", "accounting for approximately 18 percent of caloric intake. Sugar\nsuppresses your immune system and stimulates yeast overgrowth inyour bowel. Y east grows by fermenting sugar and says thank youfor all this added sugar by making billions of baby yeasts.\nAnother dietary stress is white \ufb02our. Vitamins were discovered\nby a settler who went on sailing expeditions with Dutch explor-ers. He found that the colonists were becoming ill, yet thecolony\u2019s chickens were looking unusually healthy. Finding this tobe curious, he began feeding the chickens\u2019 food to the people.Over a period of several weeks, the people became stronger andhealthier. He (incorrectly) named the chicken feed vital amines ,\nmeaning \u201cvital proteins,\u201d and began selling it. The name was latershortened to vitamins .\nT oday, scientists understand what happened to those colonists.\nPolishing off the brown outer coat, or bran, from rice hadbecome fashionable. The rice bran was then used as chicken feed.The bran, however, contains most of the vitamins and minerals.The colonists therefore quickly became nutritionally de\ufb01cient,while the chickens \ufb02ourished. In the United States, approximately18 percent of calories come from white \ufb02our. However, white\ufb02our, just like white rice, has had the bran removed and thereforeis also signi\ufb01cantly depleted of vitamins and minerals.\nAs you can see, from just the use of white \ufb02our and added\nsugar, Americans often reduce their vitamin and mineral intake byaround 35 percent. Adding to this problem are the nutrients thatare lost in the canning of vegetables and in the processing offoods, which can cause vitamin losses of up to 80 percent.\nThe Link Between Nutrient De\ufb01ciency, Diseases, and\nChronic Pain\nAs Dr. S. B. Eaton noted in his study in the prestigious New\nEngland Journal of Medicine , \u201cPhysicians and nutritionists are\nincreasingly convinced that the dietary habits adopted by West-ern society over the past one hundred years make an importantetiologic [causative] contribution to coronary heart diseasesGENERAL PRINCIPLES OF PAIN RELIEF\n8", "[angina], hypertension, diabetes, and some types of cancer.\u201d This\nis the same conclusion that was reached by the authors of Western\nDiseases: Their Emergence and Prevention by the Harvard Univer-\nsity Press.\nJust as nutritional de\ufb01ciencies can cause these medical prob-\nlems, not having adequate nutrients can cause pain and keep thepain from going away. The late Dr. Janet Travell, White Housephysician for Presidents John F . Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnsonand professor emeritus of internal medicine at George Washing-ton University, cowrote Myofascial Pain and Dysfunction: The Trig-\nger Point Manual , which is acknowledged as the authoritative work\non muscle pain. In one chapter alone, Dr. Travell and coauthor Dr.David Simons referenced 317 studies showing that problems suchas hormonal, vitamin, and mineral de\ufb01ciencies can contribute tomuscle disorders. Dr. Travell strongly encouraged me in my work,and my landmark study on effective pain management was dedi-cated to her memory.\nNumerous other studies have shown that adequate amounts of\nvitamins and minerals, especially folic acid, zinc (found to be verylow in people with \ufb01bromyalgia), and selenium, are critical forproper immune function\u2014that is, for defense against infections.Vitamin A, beta-carotene, vitamin B \u2086, vitamin C, vitamin E, iron,\nand many other nutrients also have been found to be very impor-tant in keeping the body\u2019s defenses strong.\nAddressing Skeptics\nI sometimes hear doctors express skepticism about the importanceof nutritional supplements. A typical comment is, \u201cFive hundredyears ago, there were no vitamin tablets, and people seemed to dojust \ufb01ne.\u201d These doctors forget that \ufb01ve hundred years ago sugarwas expensive and not readily available. The king of Englandmight have sprinkled a teaspoon of sugar on his food as a sign ofpower, but he had to send someone to the West Indies to get it!People ate whole-grain bread and fresh locally grown produce,and only the wealthiest had re\ufb01ned \ufb02our or much fatty meat.GIVING YOUR BODY WHAT IT NEEDS TO HEAL YOUR PAIN\n9", "The argument about people not needing vitamin tablets \ufb01ve\nhundred years ago simply does not apply to the average modernAmerican. A study reported in the American Journal of Clinical\nNutrition showed that fewer than 5 percent of the study partici-\npants consumed the recommended daily amounts (RDAs) of alltheir needed vitamins and minerals. What is frightening is thatthis study was conducted in Beltsville, Maryland, on e mployees of\nthe U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) research center.\nDespite this, some cynics still like to say that the vitamins go\nout in your urine, so all you\u2019re doing by taking vitamin supple-ments is making expensive urine. Using this line of reasoning,these cynics can stop drinking water (it just goes out in theirurine). That way, they\u2019ll soon stop annoying people who are inthe process of getting themselves well.\nVitamin and Mineral Supplementation\nEvery vitamin and nutritional mineral, amino acid, and nutritionalcofactor is very important in some way to health. The bodydepends on receiving vitamins and minerals from the diet becauseit cannot make them itself. If you are low in vitamins, minerals, and\nother nutrients, your pain simply will not go away! Because of this, an\nexcellent nutritional supplement is critical to your becoming painfree.\nFor example, inositol; vitamins B \u2081, B \u2086, and B \u2081\u2082; zinc; and\nantioxidants are critical for healing neuropathies (nerve pain). Formuscle pain, magnesium, B vitamins, antioxidants, zinc, iodine,selenium, and malic acid are critical. In fact, each kind of pain hasdifferent nutrients that are important for its relief.\nAs there are literally dozens of different nutrients that are crit-\nical for tissue repair, I recommend that you use a powdered nutri-tional supplement called the Energy Revitalization System byEnzymatic Therapy. I developed this product so that my patientscould easily get the nutritional support they need without takinghandfuls of tablets. One hundred percent of my royalties go tocharity, and the product is available in most health food stores (orGENERAL PRINCIPLES OF PAIN RELIEF\n10", "online at vitality101.com). One good-tasting drink and one cap-\nsule replace over thirty-\ufb01ve tablets of supplements a day. TheEnergy Revitalization System, which consists of a vitamin pow-der and a B-complex drink, contains over \ufb01fty nutrients includ-ing almost all the key nutrients recommended in this chapterexcept for iron (which is toxic to take unless you are iron de\ufb01-cient), calcium (which blocks thyroid hormone absorption andshould be taken at nighttime), and essential fatty acids (oil andwater don\u2019t mix). Many people \ufb01nd that simply taking this prod-uct for optimal nutritional support can help them feel much bet-ter while decreasing and sometimes eliminating their pain after sixweeks. It can replace the multivitamin and almost all of the nutri-tional supplements that most people take. (T o make it easy, whenI recommend speci\ufb01c nutrients I will often note whether or notthey are in the vitamin powder and B-complex drink, althoughmost are.) Alternatively, the individual nutrients I recommend canbe obtained separately or in other forms.\nSome people will develop diarrhea from products containing\nmagnesium. Most people, however, \ufb01nd that the vitamin powdersimply makes them wonderfully regular. If diarrhea is a problem,you can cut the dose of the powder in half or take it with milk,and this will usually take care of it. In addition, any supplementcontaining B vitamins can turn your urine bright yellow. This isnormal.\nAlthough many excellent physicians use them, I do not rec-\nommend checking blood levels for most nutrients because the testsare often inaccurate, expensive, and/or unnecessary. I feel it is bet-ter and less expensive to simply use the vitamin powder. Theexceptions would be iron and vitamin B\n12levels. Let\u2019s discuss\nsome key nutrients in a bit more depth.\nIron. Iron is important because an iron level that is too low can\ncause pain, fatigue, poor immune function, cold intolerance,decreased thyroid function, and poor memory. T oo high an ironlevel can cause arthritis, diabetes, in\ufb02ammation, and even death.GIVING YOUR BODY WHAT IT NEEDS TO HEAL YOUR PAIN\n11", "I routinely recommend that all of my chronic pain patients have\ntheir iron level, total iron binding capacity (TIBC), and ferritinlevels checked. Even if a person\u2019s iron level is suboptimal but stillnormal, that person will often feel fatigue and pain, despite testresults saying that the person is not anemic. Signi\ufb01cant iron de\ufb01-ciency symptoms can often occur with a low \u201cnormal\u201d iron level.Because of this, anyone whose ferritin level is below 40, or whosepercentage iron saturation (TIBC) is less than 22 percent, shouldbe given a trial treatment of iron therapy.\nVitamin B 12.Vitamin B 12is another key nutrient. T echnically, the\nB\u2081\u2082level is normal if it is over 208 picograms per deciliter (pg/dL)\nof blood. However, studies have shown that people can suffersevere and sometimes long-term nerve and brain dysfunctionfrom B \u2081\u2082de\ufb01ciency, even if their levels are as high as 300 pg/dL.\nWhy are the \u201cnormal\u201d levels set so low? In part, the normal val-ues were initially set according to what prevents anemia. How-ever, the needs of brains and nervous systems for vitamin B \u2081\u2082are\noften much higher than those of the bone marrow. Also, as muchas I hate to admit it, medical schools have greatly enjoyed pokingfun at the old-time doctors who gave vitamin B \u2081\u2082shots for fatigue.\nThe use of B \u2081\u2082shots despite \u201cnormal\u201d blood levels is considered\nalmost a symbol of unscienti\ufb01c, archaic medicine. As noted in aneditorial in the New England Journal of Medicine , however, current\n\ufb01ndings suggest that those old-time doctors may have been right.In addition, a recent study using the respected Framingham data-base showed that evidence of B \u2081\u2082de\ufb01ciency occurs even with lev-\nels over 500 pg/dL. I suspect, though, that the modern medicalestablishment will be a little slow to eat crow.\nIt is no surprise, then, when their other problems are also\ntreated, many people respond dramatically to B \u2081\u2082injections. In\naddition to fatigue, it can be very helpful for nerve pain,migraines, and other problems. If a patient\u2019s B \u2081\u2082level is under\n540 pg/mL, I treat that person with a 1 cc (1,000 to 3,000 mcg)injection of vitamin B \u2081\u2082one to \ufb01ve times a week, for \ufb01fteen injec-GENERAL PRINCIPLES OF PAIN RELIEF\n12", "tions. These shots are very safe and fairly inexpensive. Usually, if\na patient is going to bene\ufb01t from the shots, I see improvement byten weeks. But if a patient feels worse when the injections arestopped, I resume giving the shots, usually giving one every oneto \ufb01ve weeks (but as often as three to four times a week in somecases) for an extended period of time. Most people can maintainexcellent B \u2081\u2082levels by taking the 500 micrograms of B \u2081\u2082in the\nEnergy Revitalization System.\nOther B Vitamins. Vitamins B \u2081, B \u2082, B \u2086, and B \u2081\u2082have been found\nto be clinically effective in helping a number of chronic pain con-ditions, including low back pain, migraines, sciatica, trigeminalneuralgia, and diabetic neuropathy. Now researchers at the ParkerInstitute in Dallas have conducted a study suggesting that thesevitamins may also help treat painful sprains, old fractures, burns,and bruises. The study suggests that B vitamins may possess theability to block a certain type of pain receptor, especially inpatients with neuropathic pain.\nMagnesium. Magnesium is probably the single most important\nnutrient for pain relief. It is involved in hundreds of differentfunctions and is routinely low in the American diet as a result offood processing. The average American diet supplies less than 300milligrams (mg) of magnesium per day, while the average Asiandiet supplies over 600 mg per day. I generally recommend taking900 mg of malic acid and 150 to 200 mg of magnesium glycinatea day (both present in the vitamin powder). If diarrhea andcramps are not a problem, you can take up to 500 mg of magne-sium daily. If you get uncomfortable diarrhea from the magne-sium, cut the dosage back and then slowly increase the dose as iscomfortable.\nIf your body\u2019s magnesium stores are low, your muscles will stay\nin spasm and your pain will not resolve. This is one of the reasonsthat taking magnesium is so critical. In addition, magnesium isimportant for your muscle and body strength and energy. Most ofGIVING YOUR BODY WHAT IT NEEDS TO HEAL YOUR PAIN\n13", "your magnesium is inside your cells, and the blood tests only mea-\nsure the magnesium in your blood, making blood tests an unreli-able measure. Almost everyone with pain should take magnesium,but if you have kidney failure discuss your dosage and regimenwith your physician. Magnesium absorption is very dif\ufb01cult,which is why I like to use the glycinate form. Plain magnesiumoxide is also available and is the most inexpensive form of mag-nesium, but your body may not absorb it well. If you choose totake magnesium oxide, take 500 mg per day.\nIn addition to helping muscle pain when taken by mouth or\nintravenously, intravenous (and often oral) magnesium has otherbene\ufb01ts as well. T wo grams of intravenous magnesium given overa few minutes will routinely knock out an acute migraine. Inaddition, it is very good for esophageal spasms and for preventingkidney stones.\nCalcium. Most people do not need calcium supplementation, and\n(as is the case with iron) taking it at the same time as a thyroidhormone will block the thyroid hormone\u2019s absorption. Some peo-ple\u2019s pain improves with taking calcium, and others get worse. Inaddition, calcium is best taken with meals to enhance absorption,and at night as it also helps sleep.\nMost calcium tablets are made of calcium carbonate (chalk)\nand often will not dissolve in the stomach. They then go out inthe stool, having done no good along the way. It is better to usechewable calcium or other forms of calcium such as calcium cit-rate or chelates, taking 500 to 600 mg at bedtime and perhaps thesame amount at dinner. This is most important, however, inwomen over forty years old. Although calcium gets much atten-tion in the treatment of osteoporosis, other nutrients are as, ormore, important (see Chapter 6). In fact, countries with the high-est calcium intakes often have the highest rates of osteoporosis.\nVitamin C and Vitamin D. In a study of 324 patients with arthritis\nof the knee, those taking over 200 mg a day of vitamin C had lesspain than those taking smaller amounts. One epidemiologic studyGENERAL PRINCIPLES OF PAIN RELIEF\n14", "also suggested that taking vitamin C may prevent the development\nof pain and worsening of the arthritis as seen on x-ray.\nAnother problem is that people tend to get most of their vita-\nmin D from exposure to sunlight, and, unfortunately, Americanshave been misled into thinking that sunshine is bad for them.Most of the skin cancers that are caused by excess sun exposureare not especially dangerous and are easy to treat. Some doctorsalso think that the rise in dangerous skin cancers (melanomas) isalso associated with excess sun exposure. I do not believe this isthe case, as most melanomas occur in clothed areas that are notexposed to the sun. As time goes on, I think we\u2019ll \ufb01nd that theincrease in this single type of dangerous skin cancer is largelycaused by other factors besides sunshine. Dr. Michael Holick,director of the vitamin D research lab at Boston University Med-ical Center, thinks that \u201cthe current message that all unprotectedsun exposure is bad for you is too extreme . . . the original mes-sage was that people should limit their sun exposure, not that theyshould avoid the sun entirely. I do believe that some unprotectedexposure to the sun is important for health.\u201d This is supported byevidence that vitamin D de\ufb01ciency can contribute to many can-cers including prostate, colon, and breast cancer. Dr. Holick feelsthat vitamin D may also help protect against heart disease, autoim-mune disease, and even type 1 diabetes. For example, multiplesclerosis is mostly seen in northern latitudes where people get lesssunshine. Now we are also \ufb01nding that vitamin D de\ufb01ciency maycontribute to unexplained muscle and bone pain. In a study of 150children and adults with unexplained muscle and bone pain,almost all were found to be vitamin D de\ufb01cient\u2014with manybeing severely de\ufb01cient with very low vitamin D levels.\nThe RDA (which I feel is often inadequate) for vitamin D is\n200 to 400 IU/day for most people. One glass of forti\ufb01ed milk ororange juice has approximately 100 units of vitamin D, and mostmultivitamins have 400 units or less. T o put it in perspective, alight-skinned person wearing a swimsuit at the beach will getabout 20,000 units of vitamin D in the time it takes his or her skinto get lightly pink.GIVING YOUR BODY WHAT IT NEEDS TO HEAL YOUR PAIN\n15", "Copper. This nutrient is a double-edged sword. Because copper\nis pro-in\ufb02ammatory, it can aggravate arthritis and many otherin\ufb02ammatory and autoimmune processes. On the other hand,copper de\ufb01ciency can contribute to de\ufb01ciencies of a criticalantioxidant called superoxide dismutase. The bottom line is thatit\u2019s good to get just a tiny bit of copper. T o be on the safe side, Irecommend approximately 0.5 mg a day.\nEssential Fatty Acids. Although we get excessive fat in the Ameri-\ncan diet, most of it is not the type that our bodies need. Y our bodyneeds speci\ufb01c fats for proper hormonal and cell function. For exam-ple, the omega-3 fatty acids found in \ufb01sh oils are anti-in\ufb02ammatoryand can be helpful in rheumatoid arthritis and other types of pain.As a fringe bene\ufb01t, high intakes of \ufb01sh oil are associated with adecreased risk of Alzheimer\u2019s disease and cognitive impairment.\nBecause of the cost, I do not routinely recommend essential\nfatty acid supplementation for everyone. If you have dry eyes ordry mouth, however, this suggests essential fatty acid de\ufb01ciencies,especially of the oils found in \ufb01sh. For years I would only use\ufb02axseed oil (which is poorly converted to the type of omega-3fatty acids found in \ufb01sh) because most \ufb01sh oils contain toxins suchas mercury and lead and are also rancid. Fortunately, there arenow a few brands of \ufb01sh oil that have no mercury or toxins andare not rancid. T wo brands of \ufb01sh oil that I recommend areEskimo 3 and Nordic Naturals. Take one to three teaspoons (orthree to nine capsules) a day for nine months if you have dry eyesor dry mouth\u2014symptoms that are suggestive of this de\ufb01ciency.\nNutrients That Help Both Pain and Energy\nThere are a number of nutrients that can be very helpful for bothpain and energy, but which are not in my vitamin powder. Theseoften are only needed for four to eight months, but can be veryhelpful. I recommend you take all three of these for at least threemonths.GENERAL PRINCIPLES OF PAIN RELIEF\n16", "D-Ribose. This excellent nutrient is a key building block for mak-\ning energy and can be very helpful in decreasing both pain andfatigue. The early results that I have seen have been so impressivethat we are now in the process of doing a study on it in ourresearch center. Ribose comes as a sweet-tasting powder that canbe used like sugar and is available in a product called Corvalen byValen Labs. I recommend taking one scoop (5 grams) three timesa day for three weeks, and then one scoop twice a day. After threemonths, you can stop it to see if it is still needed. Results are usu-ally seen within a month.\nAcetyl-L-Carnitine. Acetyl-L-carnitine is critical for both energy\nproduction and the ability to lose weight, and I suspect that thisde\ufb01ciency is an important cause of the average thirty-two-poundweight gain that is seen with CFS and \ufb01bromyalgia. Take one 500mg capsule twice a day for three months; then reduce to 250 to500 mg once a day or stop it.\nCoenzyme Q10. This nutrient is especially important for anyone\nwho is taking cholesterol-lowering prescriptions (such as Meva-cor), which can often cause or aggravate muscle pain. Take 200mg (I use the Vitaline brand) once a day with a meal that has fat,with oil supplements, or in an oil-based form to improve absorp-tion. This supplement helps your body produce energy.\nThe Importance of a Healthy Diet\nAlthough I strongly recommend taking nutritional supplements toensure obtaining the necessary nutrients, I also want to stress thateating a good healthy diet is important. Eat a lot of whole grains,fresh fruits (whole fruit, not fruit juice), and fresh vegetables. Manyraw vegetables have enzymes that improve digestion and help todecrease pain. Y ou do not have to cut out all foods that might be\u201cbad\u201d or eat a diet that is impossible to follow. All you need to dois eat a diet that is reasonably healthy and low in added sugar.GIVING YOUR BODY WHAT IT NEEDS TO HEAL YOUR PAIN\n17", "When I tell people to cut out sugar, I like to add the three magic\nwords \u201cexcept for chocolate\u201d! I consider chocolate to be a healthyfood. T o have your cake and eat it too (so to speak), consider sugar-free chocolates. Some are awful but others are spectacular. RussellStover has a whole line of sugar-free chocolates that are outstand-ing. There are many healthy sugar substitutes. Stevia is excellent,healthy, and easy to use. The best tasting brands of stevia I\u2019ve foundare from Body Ecology and Stevita (see Appendix B or vitality101.com). Many others are bitter. Inositol (which helps anxiety andnerve pain) and xylitol (which decreases osteoporosis) look and tastejust like sugar. Saccharin (which comes in the pink packets) is alsoOK, but because of safety concerns I do not recommend aspartame(NutraSweet). Some sugar substitutes (although not stevia, saccha-rin, or Splenda) can cause gas or diarrhea.\nIn addition, most Americans are chronically dehydrated, and\nthis can make you feel worse as well. I do not recommend thatyou count glasses of water; this is an annoying way to spend a day.Simply check in with your mouth and lips every so often. If theyare dry, you are dehydrated and need to drink more water.\nThe more unprocessed your diet is, the healthier you will be.\nOn the other hand, things that give you pleasure and make youfeel good are generally good for you (contrary to popular belief ).Y our body will tell you what\u2019s good for you by making you feelgood.\nSleep: The Foundation of Pain Relief\nT o eliminate muscle and many other sources of pain, it is criticalto get eight to nine hours of solid, deep sleep each night on aregular basis. Disordered sleep is, in my opinion, a major under-lying process that perpetuates pain. Inadequate sleep can occur fora number of reasons. Many Americans simply do not makeenough time for adequate sleep. A hundred years ago, the averageAmerican was getting nine hours of sleep a night. Anthropolo-gists tell us that \ufb01ve thousand years ago, the average night\u2019s sleepwas eleven to twelve hours a night. When the sun went down, itGENERAL PRINCIPLES OF PAIN RELIEF\n18", "was dark, boring, and dangerous outside, so people went to bed.\nWhen the sun came up, they woke up. The use of candles initiallyshortened sleep time. Then light bulbs were developed, followedby radio, TV , computers, and so on. We are now down to an aver-age of six and a half to seven hours of sleep a night, and this issimply not adequate to allow proper tissue repair.\nSome people get inadequate sleep because of poor sleep\nhygiene, often occurring because pain keeps them awake. Othershave insomnia because the sleep center in the brain (called thehypothalamus) is suppressed by the same process that is causingthe pain. A poll conducted by the National Sleep Foundationfound that 58 percent of Americans had sleep dif\ufb01culties. This hadincreased from 51 percent the year before. In addition, 15 percentof Americans use a prescription or over-the-counter sleep aid, andthose who slept less than six hours a night felt more stressed,angry, sad, and tired than the people who got more sleep. The sur-vey also found that only 30 percent of people reported getting therecommended eight hours of sleep a night, down from 38 percentthe year before.\nKey Stages of Sleep for Pain Relief\nSleep has a distinct architecture with key stages. Stages 1 and 2sleep are fairly light, while stages 3 and 4 sleep (also called deltawave sleep) are the deeper stages of sleep. My experience, and thatof many other clinicians, suggests that what is de\ufb01cient in\ufb01bromyalgia and likely in many pain patients are the deeper,restorative stages of sleep (stages 3 and 4). These are the stages inwhich you produce growth hormone, which results in tissuerepair and healing. Unfortunately, most sleeping pills in commonuse keep people in light stage 2 sleep, which can actually maketheir problem worse. The good news is that there are a number ofexceptions.\nSeveral studies have shown that if you continually wake peo-\nple up whenever they go into deep sleep, or even shake themlightly so that they go from deep sleep into light sleep, they willdevelop pain within one to two weeks and often within oneGIVING YOUR BODY WHAT IT NEEDS TO HEAL YOUR PAIN\n19", "night. In fact, inadequate sleep has repeatedly been shown to con-\ntribute to pain. In a study of \ufb01bromyalgia patients, it was foundthat increased pain sensitivity is associated with greater sleep dis-turbance. Another study of female of\ufb01ce employees in one largecompany showed that women who suffer from frequent musclepain also have insuf\ufb01cient sleep.\nI \ufb01nd that when my patients get eight to nine hours of solid\nsleep regularly each night for six to nine months, their pain and,interestingly, their inability to fall asleep both resolve. They arethen able to markedly reduce the amount of sleep and pain med-ications that they need. Breaking the cycle of poor sleep andmaintaining quality sleep for at least six to nine months is criticalto breaking the cycle of pain. Eight to nine hours of solid sleepeach night without waking or hangover is the goal and, hard asthis may be to believe, it is very attainable using the suggestionsthat I will give you in this chapter.\nNatural Sleep Aids\nIn general, I think it is a good idea to begin with natural reme-dies and good sleep hygiene. Y ou may, however, have a problemwith your sleep center (the hypothalamus) not working or withthe pain simply keeping you awake at night. Because of this, inlight of how critical it is that you get eight to nine hours of solidsleep a night, I would strongly encourage you to add prescriptiontherapies if the natural approaches are not adequate. This willmake a big difference in making your pain go away, and you canusually decrease or come off the prescriptions about six monthsafter you are feeling better.\nI recommend the following natural sleep aids:\n\u2022Revitalizing Sleep Formula\u2014a mix of six sleep herbals\n\u2022Hydroxy L-tryptophan (5-HTP)\u2014aids the body in making\nserotonin\n\u2022Melatonin\u2014a natural hormone\n\u2022Calcium and magnesiumGENERAL PRINCIPLES OF PAIN RELIEF\n20", "Chapter 11 gives complete information on these aids and how to\nuse them. Most of these remedies are not sedating, yet they willhelp you fall asleep and stay in deep sleep.\nAnother natural way to help yourself fall asleep is to play deep-\nsleep\u2013inducing tapes or CDs. If you wake up during the night,you can push your sound system\u2019s replay button. Better yet, get aCD or tape player that can replay continuously throughout thenight. Delta-wave-sleep\u2013inducing tapes and CDs (and the naturalsleep aids) are available online at my website, vitality101.com.\nGood Sleep Hygiene\nThese are some important things to consider that enhance goodsleep hygiene:\n\u2022Do not consume alcohol near bedtime.\n\u2022Do not consume any caffeine after 4:00 p .m.\n\u2022Do not use your bed for problem solving or doing work.\n\u2022Take a hot bath before bed.\n\u2022Keep your bedroom cool.\n\u2022If your partner snores, sleep in a separate bedroom (after\ntucking in or being tucked in by your partner) or get a goodpair of earplugs and use them. The wax plugs that mold tothe shape of the ear are often the best ones.\n\u2022Put the bedroom clock out of arm\u2019s reach and facing away\nfrom you so you can\u2019t see it. Looking at the clock frequentlyaggravates sleep problems and is frustrating.\n\u2022Have a light snack before bedtime. Hunger and\nhypoglycemia cause insomnia in all animals, and humans areno exception. For your snack, eat foods high in the aminoacid tryptophan, such as milk and turkey, which contributeto sleep.\nIf you frequently wake up to urinate during the night, do not\ndrink a lot of \ufb02uids near bedtime. Most pain patients wake duringthe night because their sleep center is not working properly orGIVING YOUR BODY WHAT IT NEEDS TO HEAL YOUR PAIN\n21", "because of the pain. Since they also have a full bladder, they think\nthey are waking up because they have to urinate. This is usuallynot the case. They are waking up because of their pain syndrome.There is a simple way to remedy this problem. If and when youwake up during the night and you notice your bladder is full, justtalk to it (in your mind, so your spouse doesn\u2019t think you\u2019re crazy)and tell it to go back to sleep\u2014you\u2019ll pee in the morning. If youstill have to urinate \ufb01ve minutes later, go to the bathroom. Y ouwill most likely \ufb01nd that your bladder will happily go back tosleep, and when you wake up in the morning, you won\u2019t evenhave to urinate as badly as you did when you woke up in the mid-dle of the night.\nSleep Medications\nAlthough I much prefer natural remedies to prescription medica-tions, natural remedies do not solve sleep problems for everyone,and it may be necessary to use a prescription sleep medication.(See Chapter 13 for a detailed discussion of prescription sleepmedications.) Unfortunately, most sleeping pills in common use(for example, Dalmane, Halcion, and Valium) may actually worsenthe quality of sleep by increasing the amount of light stage (espe-cially stage 2) sleep and decreasing the deep stages of sleep evenfurther. Y ou want to be certain that the treatments and medica-tions you use leave you feeling better the next day, not worse.\nEven if you are someone who needs prescription sleep aids,\nadding natural remedies can be very helpful and usually decreasesthe amount of medication that you will need, resulting in fewerside effects. By using a combination of the treatments discussed,almost all people, even those with chronic pain, can get eight tonine hours of solid sleep a night. It usually takes trial and error to\ufb01nd out exactly what is best for you, but it is worth being persis-tent. In addition, once you come off the sleep medications (usu-ally after nine to eighteen months, although they can be usedinde\ufb01nitely if needed) you may \ufb01nd that all you require are thenatural remedies. Whatever treatments you use, though, it isGENERAL PRINCIPLES OF PAIN RELIEF\n22", "important that they not only increase the duration of sleep but\nalso maintain or improve the deep stages (stages 3 and 4) of sleep.\nIt is not uncommon to see your sleep worsen again (even if\nyou\u2019ve been feeling better) during periods of increased stress\u2014whether physical or emotional\u2014and the \ufb02aring of your illness.During these times, increase the treatments for as long as you needso that you get eight hours of solid sleep a night, and then taperthem or stop them when the problem is resolved. The best way toneed less medication in the long run is to use as much as it takesto get eight to nine hours of solid sleep each night without wak-ing or feeling hungover for six to eighteen months.\nMany people, because of fear of addiction and concern about\nhaving to use constantly escalating doses of sleeping pills, areafraid to take enough medication to get adequate sleep. If I havea patient who has been feeling better and then \ufb01nds that his or herpain is coming back, one of the \ufb01rst things I ask is, \u201cHow is yoursleep?\u201d The usual answer is, \u201cNot good.\u201d However, they are sograteful to get \ufb01ve hours of sleep a night that they settle for it.That\u2019s a bad idea!

Y ou\u2019ll be very happy you did.\nTreating Hormonal De\ufb01ciencies\nOur hormonal system regulates our body\u2019s metabolism. Althoughmost hormonal de\ufb01ciencies (and sometimes excesses) can causepain, the key players are hypothyroidism, inadequate adrenalfunction, and low growth hormone. In addition, if your painbegan from ages forty to sixty, it is worth considering low testos-terone in men and low estrogen or testosterone in women. Recentpress reports about problems with Premarin (an estrogen productextracted from pregnant horses\u2019 urine) were no surprise. Manydoctors have been saying for over a decade that it is insane for peo-ple to take Premarin as these estrogens are markedly differentfrom the ones your body makes. We will discuss ways to giveestrogen therapy that can be much safer and may actually decreaseGIVING YOUR BODY WHAT IT NEEDS TO HEAL YOUR PAIN\n23", "the risk of developing cancer. For now, however, let\u2019s begin with\nhypothyroidism\u2014a condition in which the thyroid gland fails toproduce enough thyroid hormone and the most important hor-monal trigger for chronic pain.\nHypothyroidism\nThe thyroid gland, located in the neck area, is the body\u2019s gaspedal, regulating the body\u2019s metabolic speed. If the thyroid glandproduces insuf\ufb01cient amounts of thyroid hormones, metabolismdecreases and the person will be in pain. As I mentioned earlier,it is not uncommon for chronic pain patients to put on twenty to\ufb01fty pounds during the \ufb01rst years of their illness. In addition tonerve, muscle, ligament/tendon, and other pains, other symptomsof hypothyroidism include fatigue, infertility, weight gain, \u201cbrainfog,\u201d constipation, and intolerance to cold.\nWhy Hypothyroidism May Go Undiagnosed. Modern medicine has\ngone through many generations of thyroid tests, and with each newtest, we found that we missed an enormous number of cases ofhypothyroidism. T o make matters more dif\ufb01cult, if the thyroid isunderactive because the hypothalamus is suppressed (as is commonin chronic pain), the TSH test, which is the test most often used,may appear to be normal, or even suggest an overactive thyroid.\nUnfortunately, our current thyroid testing will miss most\npatients with an underactive thyroid. Once again, doctors ofdecades ago were on target when they knew that one has to treatthe patient and not the blood test. In fact, in November 2002 theAmerican Academy of Clinical Endocrinologists again changedthe normal range on the TSH thyroid blood test (so that a TSHover 3 warranted treatment), increasing the number of patientswith hypothyroidism in the United States from 13 to 26 million.Less than a quarter of these patients have been properly diagnosedand treated.\nI have found\u2014either through blood testing or according to\nsymptoms\u2014that over 47 percent of my \ufb01bromyalgia patients haveGENERAL PRINCIPLES OF PAIN RELIEF\n24", "a low thyroid and that 83 percent of these patients have improved\nby taking a low dose of thyroid hormone. However, years afterthe new directives have been given, doctors are still largelyunaware of these new lab guidelines for diagnosis and treatment.Even the major labs doing thyroid testing have not bothered tochange the now incorrect normal ranges for both diagnosis andtreatment of thyroid disorders.\nThe Problem with Thyroid Tests. The normal range for most blood\ntests, including thyroid hormone levels, are based on statisticalnorms (called 2 standard deviations). This means that out of everyone hundred people, those with the 2 highest and lowest scoresare de\ufb01ned as abnormal and everyone else is arbitrarily consideredto be normal. That means if a problem affects over 2 percent ofthe population (as many as 24 percent of women over sixty arehypothyroid and 12 percent of the population have abnormalantibodies attacking their thyroid), then our testing system willmiss most of them. In addition, our testing system does not takebiological individuality into account. T o translate how poorly this\u201c2 percent equals abnormal\u201d system works, consider this: if weapplied this approach to getting you a pair of shoes, any sizebetween a 4 and 13 would be \u201cmedically normal.\u201d If a man wasaccidentally given a size 5 shoe or a woman a size 12, the doctorwould say that the shoe sizes they were given are \u201cnormal,\u201d andthere is no problem!\nSimply changing the normal range for the TSH test to less than\n3 increased the number of Americans with thyroid illness from13 million to 26 million. Unfortunately, over 13 million Ameri-cans with thyroid disease remain undiagnosed, and the majorityof those receiving treatment are not being dosed appropriately.Doctors do not know that they have not been adequately trainedin the proper diagnosis or treatment of hypothyroidism, and thecost in human life and devastating illness is enormous. Whatmakes this especially tragic is how easy treatment is if doctors aregiven and use the correct information.GIVING YOUR BODY WHAT IT NEEDS TO HEAL YOUR PAIN\n25", "The Potential Cost of Missing Hypothyroidism. A study in the\nprestigious Annals of Internal Medicine noted that hypothyroidism\n\u201ccontributed to 60 percent of cases of myocardial infarction [heartattacks] among women affected by subclinical [even mild] hypo-thyroidism.\u201d It contributed more to causing heart attacks in thesepatients than smoking, elevated cholesterol, high blood pressure,or diabetes. As a result, there may be over thirty thousand pre-ventable deaths per year from heart attacks as women withuntreated hypothyroidism are more than twice as likely to have aheart attack.\nIn addition, 6 percent of miscarriages are associated with\nhypothyroidism with 4,600 miscarriages per year after \ufb01fteenweeks of pregnancy and countless more before. Undiagnosedhypothyroidism is also associated with infertility. In moderate toseverely hypothyroid mothers, the baby was also over six times aslikely to die soon after being born. In addition, children born tohypothyroid mothers have a lower IQ by an average of 7 points.They are almost four times as likely to have an IQ under 85 andover twice as likely to have learning dif\ufb01culties resulting in theirhaving to repeat a grade.\nOver six million Americans have \ufb01bromyalgia, and tens of\nmillions more have chronic muscle pain. Undiagnosed or inade-quately treated thyroid disorders contribute to these unnecessar-ily disabling conditions.\nAs I mentioned earlier, hypothyroidism is a major cause of\ngaining and being unable to lose weight. It also causes fatigue, dryhair, coarse skin, depression, and \u201cbrain fog\u201d as well. As a result,hypothyroidism is often confused with depression and can be mis-takenly treated with Prozac. This is an even bigger problem in theelderly who are being misdiagnosed with depression or Alz-heimer\u2019s/senility when what they have is hypothyroidism.\nFortunately, given the proper information, hypothyroidism\ncan be incredibly easy and inexpensive to diagnose and treat.Sadly, because of lack of awareness and open-mindedness on theGENERAL PRINCIPLES OF PAIN RELIEF\n26", "part of our medical community, Americans still unnecessarily suf-\nfer from a major public health disaster.\nTreating an Underactive Thyroid. If you have chronic pain and suf-\nfer from even two of the following symptoms, you should con-sider asking your doctor to prescribe a low dose of thyroidhormone.\n\u2022Chronic fatigue\n\u2022Heavy periods\n\u2022Constipation\n\u2022Easy weight gain\n\u2022Cold intolerance\n\u2022Dry skin\n\u2022Thin hair\n\u2022A body temperature that tends to be under 98.6\u00b0\nIn addition, family members of those with a low thyroid have about\na 50 percent chance of also getting it. If your doctor won\u2019t prescribethyroid hormone, you may wish to consult one who is open to theidea (see Appendix B). Before seeing a new doctor, call and ask ifhe or she sometimes treats people with thyroid hormone despite theblood tests being normal if their symptoms show they need it. Aslong as you do not have underlying angina/heart disease and youfollow up with a blood test to make sure that your free T4 bloodtest (do not use TSH) thyroid levels are in a safe range (going abovethe upper limit of normal may aggravate osteoporosis), a trial oflow-dose thyroid hormone treatment is usually safe and may be dra-matically bene\ufb01cial.\nSome patients have found desiccated thyroid (Armour Thy-\nroid) to be helpful and the synthetic thyroid (Synthroid) not tobe. Some have found the opposite. What is important to know isthat if you have muscle or nerve pain and an underactive thyroidthat is not treated (even if your blood tests come back normal),GIVING YOUR BODY WHAT IT NEEDS TO HEAL YOUR PAIN\n27", "these pains simply will not resolve. Many experts on chronic pain\nagree.\nThyroid treatment despite normal tests is very controversial,\neven though it\u2019s usually very safe. All treatments (even aspirin) cancause problems in some people. Thyroid treatment can triggercaffeine-like anxiety or palpitations. If this happens, cut back thedose and increase by one-half to one 30 mg or 50 mcg tablet eachtwo to eight weeks as is comfortable. Sometimes taking 500 mgof vitamin B \u2081(thiamine) one to three times a day (as in the Calm-\ning Balance Formula) will also help prevent the anxiety afterabout two weeks. If you have severe, persistent racing heart, callyour family doctor and/or go to a hospital emergency room.\nLike exercise (such as climbing steps), if one is on the edge of\nhaving a heart attack or severe \u201cracing heart\u201d (atrial \ufb01brillation),thyroid hormone can trigger these occurrences. However,research suggests that thyroid hormone treatments may actuallydecrease the risk of heart disease. If you have chest pain, go to thehospital emergency room and/or call your family doctor. It willlikely be chest muscle pain (not dangerous), but better safe thansorry. To put it in perspective, I\u2019ve never seen this happen in mydecades of treating thousands of patients with thyroid hormone. \nIncreasing your thyroid hormone dose to levels above the upper\nlimit of the normal range may accelerate osteoporosis, which isalready common in those with chronic pain. Because of this, youneed to check your thyroid (free T4, not TSH) blood levels afterfour to eight weeks on your optimum dose of thyroid hormone. I\ufb01nd treatments with thyroid hormone safer than aspirin andMotrin. If you have chest pain or risk factors for angina, do anexercise stress test to make sure your heart is healthy before begin-ning thyroid hormone treatment. Risk factors for angina includediabetes, elevated cholesterol, hypertension, smoking, personal orfamily history of angina, gout, and age over \ufb01fty years old.\nWe are constantly learning powerful new tricks for treat-\ning hypothyroidism, and there are many reasonable treatmentGENERAL PRINCIPLES OF PAIN RELIEF\n28", "approaches. I would recommend starting with a trial of Armour\nThyroid. (More information is available at my website, vitality101.com.)\nAdrenal Insuf\ufb01ciency\nThe adrenal glands, which sit on top of the kidneys, are actuallytwo different glands in one. Both parts are critical to your stressresponse system. The center of the gland makes adrenaline (epi-nephrine). The outer part of the adrenal gland, called the cor-tex, also makes many important hormones (including cortisol,DHEA-S, and testosterone).\n\u2022Cortisol. The adrenal glands increase their production of\ncortisol in response to stress. Cortisol raises the blood sugarand blood pressure levels and moderates immune function,in addition to playing numerous other roles. If your cortisollevel is low, you may have fatigue, low blood pressure,hypoglycemia, poor immune function, an increasedtendency to allergies and environmental sensitivity, and aninability to deal with stress. Inadequate cortisol canmarkedly increase pain by hindering your body\u2019s ability todeal with in\ufb02ammation. In addition, recurrent drops inblood sugar (hypoglycemia) can constantly throw yourmuscles into spasm.\n\u2022Dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEA-S). Although\nits mechanism of action is not clear, DHEA is the mostabundant hormone produced by the adrenal cortex. If it islow, you will often feel unwell. Patients often feeldramatically better when their DHEA-S levels are broughtto the midnormal range for a twenty-nine-year-old.DHEA-S levels normally decline with age and often dropprematurely in \ufb01bromyalgia patients. DHEA has been calledthe \u201cfountain of youth\u201d hormone. This is because gray hairsometimes returns to its original color when one takesGIVING YOUR BODY WHAT IT NEEDS TO HEAL YOUR PAIN\n29", "DHEA. In fact, I didn\u2019t realize that my nephews thought I\nwas dying my hair for years (I would never dye my hair\u2014Ilike the salt-and-pepper look) because my normal hair colorwould return when I took DHEA!\n\u2022Testosterone. This hormone is produced in small but\nsigni\ufb01cant amounts by the adrenals as well as by the ovariesand testicles.\nCauses of Adrenal Insuf\ufb01ciency. I suspect that many people have\nadrenal burnout. Dr. Hans Selye, one of the \ufb01rst doctors toresearch stress reactions, found that if an animal becomes severelyoverstressed, its adrenal glands bleed and develop signs of adrenaldestruction before the animal \ufb01nally dies from the stress.\nIf you think back to your biology classes in high school, you\nmay remember something called the \u201c\ufb01ght-or-\ufb02ight response.\u201dThis is a physical reaction that occurs during times of stress. Dur-ing the Stone Age, when a caveman met an animal that wanted toeat him, the caveman\u2019s adrenal glands activated multiple systemsin his body that prompted him to either \ufb01ght or run. This reac-tion helped the caveman survive. In those days, however, peopleprobably had a couple of weeks or months to recover before fac-ing the next major stress. That is no longer the case. In today\u2019ssociety, especially with chronic pain, people often experiencestress reactions every few minutes.\nI suspect that many people suffer exhaustion of their adrenal\nglands. With the kinds of stresses common in modern society, aperson\u2019s adrenal test may initially show hormonal levels that areactually higher than usual, since the adrenal gland tends to over-compensate to deal with stress. Over time, this may exhaust theadrenal reserve, that is, the adrenal\u2019s ability to increase hormoneproduction in response to stress. Both high and low cortisol cancontribute to weight gain. In endocrinologist Dr. William Jef-feries\u2019 experience (and in mine as well), people with either lowhormone production or a low reserve often respond dramaticallyto treatment with low doses of adrenal hormones.GENERAL PRINCIPLES OF PAIN RELIEF\n30", "Symptoms of Adrenal Insuf\ufb01ciency. If your adrenal glands are\nunderactive, what symptoms might you experience? Low adrenalfunction can cause, among other symptoms:\n\u2022Pain and fatigue\n\u2022Recurrent infections\n\u2022\u201cCrashing\u201d during stress\n\u2022Hypoglycemia (irritability when hungry)\n\u2022Low blood pressure and dizziness upon \ufb01rst standing\nHypoglycemia deserves special mention. Many people become\nshaky and nervous, then dizzy, irritable, and fatigued when theyget hungry. They then often feel better after they eat sweets,which improve their energy and mood for a short period of time.Because of this, these people often crave sugar, not realizing thatit makes their blood sugar level initially shoot back up to normal,which is what makes them feel better, but then continue to soarbeyond normal. The body responds to this by driving the sugarlevel back down below normal again. The effect, energy-wise, islike a roller coaster.\nDr. Jefferies has noted\u2014and again, my experience con\ufb01rms\nhis \ufb01nding\u2014that most people with hypoglycemia have underac-tive adrenal glands. This makes sense because the adrenal glands\u2019responsibilities include maintaining blood sugar at an adequatelevel. Sugar is the only fuel that the brain can use. When people\u2019sblood sugar level drops, they can feel poorly and it can \ufb02are theirpain. I recommend diagnosing hypoglycemia based on symptoms.Like other tests of hormonal function, I consider glucose toler-ance tests to be incredibly unreliable.\nTreating Adrenal Insuf\ufb01ciency. People with hypoglycemia can treat\nlow blood sugar symptoms by cutting sugar and caffeine out oftheir diets; having frequent, small meals; and increasing theirintake of proteins and vegetables. Fruit\u2014not fruit juices, whichcontain concentrated sugar\u2014can be taken in moderation, aboutGIVING YOUR BODY WHAT IT NEEDS TO HEAL YOUR PAIN\n31", "one to two pieces a day, depending on the amount of sugar in the\nfruit. Taking 250 micrograms of chromium a day (present in thevitamin powder) for six months often helps smooth out hypo-glycemic symptoms.\nTreating the underactive adrenal problem usually banishes the\nsymptoms of low blood sugar. Y ou can begin with adrenal glan-dulars combined with licorice and key nutrients (all present inAdrenal Stress End, which I helped to formulate). In addition yourdoctor may consider using prescription hydrocortisone, such asCortef. (See vitality101.com for further information.) When usedin doses of 20 mg or less a day, Cortef is usually quite safe and canresult in a dramatic decrease in many types of pain. Interestingly,some doctors are using microdose Cortef therapy for arthritis.Although some doctors may charge four thousand dollars to pre-scribe this simple and inexpensive treatment, your doctor couldprescribe it for free!\nCortisone Treatment and Toxicity\nAdrenal hormones are essential for life. Without them, a persondies. But, as with any hormone, too much can be dangerous. Inthe early studies using adrenal hormones, the researchers had noidea what dose was normal and what was toxic. When they gaveinjections of the hormone to patients, the patients\u2019 arthritis wentaway and they felt better. However, because they gave patientsmany times more than the normal amount, the patients becametoxic and died. Because of this, the researchers became frightenedand avoided using adrenal hormones whenever possible. Medicalstudents were taught to avoid adrenal hormones unless no othertreatment choices existed.\nThe use of adrenal hormones needs to be put into perspective,\nhowever. Imagine if the early thyroid researchers had given theirpatients \ufb01fty times the usual dose of thyroid hormone. Thyroidpatients would have routinely died of heart attacks. The thyroidresearchers, however, were fortunate enough to stumble upon theGENERAL PRINCIPLES OF PAIN RELIEF\n32", "body\u2019s healthy dose early on and to skip these negative outcomes.\nIf they had not, people today would not be treated for an under-active thyroid until they displayed symptoms of very advancedthyroid disease (myxedema) and were nearly comatose. Medicalscience is just beginning to learn that a person can feel horribleand function poorly even with a minimal to moderate hormonede\ufb01ciency. Waiting for the person to go \u201coff the deep end\u201d of thetest\u2019s normal scale is not healthy.\nDr. Jefferies has found that as long as the adrenal hormone level\nis kept within the normal range, the main toxicity that a patientmight experience is a slight upset stomach due to the body notbeing used to having the hormone come in through the stomach.Taking the hormone with food usually helps this. In addition,some patients gain a few pounds. This is because a low adrenal levelcan cause a person\u2019s weight to drop below the body\u2019s normal setpoint, even if that set point is high because of pain or \ufb01bromyal-gia. (The average weight gain in \ufb01bromyalgia is thirty-twopounds.) However, any weight gain often is more than offset bythe weight loss resulting from being able to exercise once again.\nMany physicians do not like to prescribe even low doses of\nadrenal hormone. If your physician is uncomfortable with Cortef,invite him or her to read Dr. Jefferies\u2019 material on the safety oflow-dose cortisone as well as our recent study. Most patients onlyneed 5 to 12.5 mg of Cortef a day, equivalent to 1 to 3 mg a dayof prednisone (a more dangerous and less effective synthetic formof cortisol that your doctor is aware of ), which is a dose so lowthat most doctors have never prescribed it. After feeling well forsix to eighteen months, most people begin to slowly decrease theiradrenal hormone dosage, eventually discontinuing the treatmententirely.\nIf your symptoms started suddenly after a viral infection, if\nyou suffer from hypoglycemia or crash with stress, or if you haverecurrent sore throat or respiratory infections that take a long timeto resolve, you probably have underactive adrenal glands.GIVING YOUR BODY WHAT IT NEEDS TO HEAL YOUR PAIN\n33", "Treating Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) De\ufb01ciency\nThe adrenal gland makes many hormones in addition to hydro-\ncortisone. One of these previously mentioned is DHEA, which isoften very low in chronic pain patients. Although DHEA\u2019s func-tion is not yet fully understood, it appears to be important forgood health, which makes a low DHEA level worth treating.Some studies suggest that the higher a person\u2019s DHEA level is, thelonger that person will live and the healthier he or she will be. I\u2019mconcerned that pushing the blood level above the upper limit ofnormal may slightly increase the risk of breast cancer, so keep itin the normal range. For many patients, when a low DHEA levelis treated, the result is a dramatic boost in well-being and adecrease in pain.\nIf your DHEA-S (not DHEA) blood level is low\u2014under 120\nmicrograms per deciliter (mcg/dL) for females or 325 mcg/dLfor males\u2014I recommend beginning treatment with 5 to 25 mgof DHEA per day and slowly working up to what feels like anoptimal level to you. For women, I suggest keeping the DHEA-Slevel at around 150 to 180 mcg/dL, which is the middle of thenormal range for a twenty-nine-year-old female. For men, I keepthe DHEA-S level between 350 and 500 mcg/dL, which is thenormal range for a twenty-nine-year-old male. The low ends ofthe normal ranges are normal only for people over eighty. If youhave side effects, such as facial hair or acne, which are uncom-mon, check your blood level of DHEA-S and decrease your dose.I have found that many brands of DHEA are not reliable. I rec-ommend you use DHEA made by compounding pharmacists (seeAppendix B) or by General Nutrition Center or other reputablecompanies.\nTreating Low Testosterone: Not Only a Male Problem\nMany people going through midlife develop pain, fatigue, poorlibido, or depression. This includes men and women alike. Anunderactive adrenal gland can aggravate this problem. AlthoughGENERAL PRINCIPLES OF PAIN RELIEF\n34", "the ovaries make most of a woman\u2019s estrogen and the testicles\nmake most of a man\u2019s testosterone, in women the adrenals makesigni\ufb01cant amounts of testosterone.\nInadequate testosterone is a major problem in 70 percent of my\nmale patients with \ufb01bromyalgia and/or chronic pain. It is impor-tant (again, in both men and women) to check the free or unboundblood testosterone level. This measures the active form of the hor-mone. If your result is below normal, or even in the lowest 25 per-cent of the normal range, I would consider a trial of naturaltestosterone therapy.\nLow testosterone is associated with many problems also caused\nby pain, including fatigue, depression, poor stamina, muscle-wasting, osteoporosis, and poor libido. Chronic pain is routinelyassociated with low testosterone, further aggravating these prob-lems. In addition, taking narcotic pain medications also lowerstestosterone. Treating both men and women who have a low tes-tosterone can help all of these conditions.\nA recent study by Dr. Hillary White, an associate professor at\nDartmouth Medical School, found that testosterone replacementtherapy is helpful in the treatment of women with \ufb01bromyalgiapain. Because the study is still awaiting publication, more detailsare not yet available. Dr. White became interested in this problemwhen testosterone helped relieve her own \ufb01bromyalgia pain. Shealso notes that it is important to use natural testosterone and notthe synthetic methyl testosterone form.\nMost studies show that low testosterone in men is associated\nwith an increased risk of angina and that using natural testos-terone to bring low testosterone up to the midnormal leveldecreases angina and leg artery blockages, improves cholesterol,and may decrease diabetic tendencies. It is not clear if takingtestosterone increases the risk of prostate enlargement or cancerbeyond that of any other healthy male. While I don\u2019t feel beingtestosterone de\ufb01cient is a good way to prevent these illnesses, ifyou are a man over \ufb01fty who is taking testosterone, it is reason-GIVING YOUR BODY WHAT IT NEEDS TO HEAL YOUR PAIN\n35", "able to do a prostate exam and prostate-speci\ufb01c antigen (PSA) test\nyearly. For many, improvements in overall sense of wellness havebeen dramatic, and treating the low testosterone has been critical.\nTreating Low Estrogen and Progesterone in Women\nAlthough not likely to be a problem with men, de\ufb01ciencies ofestrogen and/or progesterone can be major problems in womenwith CFIDS/FMS.

She notes,appropriately, that the perimenopausal period (the period as youapproach menopause) has a gradual onset, and symptoms of estro-gen de\ufb01ciency can occur \ufb01ve to twelve years before your bloodtests and periods become abnormal.\nIf your pain is worse when your estrogen levels are dropping\n(during ovulation, which occurs about \ufb01fteen days after the \ufb01rstday of your period, and around your period), a trial of naturalestrogen supplementation is warranted. Other symptoms of inad-equate estrogen include inadequate vaginal lubrication, nightsweats, and/or hot \ufb02ashes.\nMost of the media attention and research about estrogen being\ndangerous relate to the use of conjugated estrogens (made usingpregnant horse urine) like Premarin, mentioned at the beginningof this chapter. I prefer to use natural biestrogen (1.25 to 2.5 mga day) from a compounding pharmacy. This contains estradiol plusestriol, a weaker form of estrogen that may actually decrease therisk of developing breast cancer. Patients with estrogen-inducedmigraines usually get them not from the estrogen itself but from\ufb02uctuating blood levels of estrogen. They will often get relief byusing estrogen patches that last for the week around their period.These give steady estrogen levels.GENERAL PRINCIPLES OF PAIN RELIEF\n36", "Unless you have had a hysterectomy, if you take supplemental\nestrogen you must also take progesterone.

Pain can be\ncaused by direct irritation caused by the infection, but can also becaused by the in\ufb02ammation or immune activation your body cre-ates as it attempts to \ufb01ght the infection\u2014like feeling achiness withthe \ufb02u. In some cases, such as Lyme disease, the role of infectionin causing the pain is fairly well accepted. In many, if not mostcases, however, the role of infections is still controversial as asource of pain. Although it is possible for numerous infections tobe the source of pain, we will focus on the most important ones.\nFungal Infections and Overgrowth\nAlthough many doctors still believe there is no such thing as fun-gal overgrowth, the increase in antibiotic and sugar use in oursociety has made this problem more common. When it affects theskin in athlete\u2019s foot or causes obvious vaginal infections, it can bereadily seen and is therefore accepted by the medical community.Unfortunately, when it affects the bowels and sinuses there is noreliable way to test for it, and many physicians still make believethat fungal overgrowth cannot occur in these areas. It can, how-ever, and it is very important to treat it.\nThere are no de\ufb01nitive tests for yeast overgrowth that will dis-\ntinguish it from normal yeast growth in the body. Nonetheless,fungal/yeast overgrowth should be considered in any of the fol-lowing situations:\n\u2022Chronic sinusitis and nasal congestion\n\u2022Spastic colon, gas, bloating, constipation, and/or diarrhea\n\u2022A history of frequent antibiotic use\n\u2022Recurrent or ongoing skin, nail, or vaginal fungal infections\n\u2022Itchy ears or anus, recurrent aphthous ulcers (painful ulcers\nin the mouth where the lips meet your gums that last for \ufb01veto ten days), and/or sugar cravings\n\u2022The presence of widespread achiness without in\ufb02ammation\n(\ufb01bromyalgia/chronic fatigue syndrome)GENERAL PRINCIPLES OF PAIN RELIEF\n40", "Although people most often speak of Candida as the main type\nof fungal infection, I suspect that these infections can be causedby many different fungi. Although many tests are recommendedto look for these infections, I do not consider them to be morereliable than simply looking for the six things that I noted above.If any of these are present, I believe that an empiric trial of anti-fungal therapy is warranted. Y our body\u2019s response to therapy is thebest indicator of whether fungal overgrowth was a problem. Ifyour symptoms initially worsen with antifungals and/or improvesigni\ufb01cantly by the end of six weeks of treatment (shorter coursesare unlikely to eradicate the problem), this suggests that fungalovergrowth is playing a role in your pain (and perhaps many othersymptoms). A number of very effective methods can be used toeliminate a yeast problem. My preference is to treat with a mix ofnatural and prescription therapies (described later in this section).If your doctor is unwilling to use prescription antifungals, eitherbegin with the natural therapies or look for a doctor who willprescribe them.\nMany physicians feel that yeast overgrowth causes a general-\nized suppression of the immune system. In other words, once theyeast gets the upper hand, it sets up a cycle that further suppressesthe body\u2019s defenses. Interestingly, a recent Mayo Clinic studyshowed that most cases of chronic sinusitis seem to be associatedwith a reaction to yeast in the sinuses\u2014something I proposedyears ago. Nonetheless, as I have already noted, this theory is con-troversial. Y east are normal members of the body\u2019s \u201czoo.\u201d Theylive in balance with bacteria\u2014some of which are helpful andhealthy and some of which are detrimental and unhealthy. Theproblems begin when this harmonious balance shifts and the yeastbegins to overgrow.\nCauses of Fungal Infections. Many things can prompt yeast to\novergrow. One of the most common causes is frequent antibioticuse. Antibiotics kill off the good bacteria in the bowel along withthe bad bacteria. When this happens, the yeast no longer havecompetition and begin to overgrow. The body is often able toELIMINATING THE CAUSES AND TRIGGERS OF YOUR PAIN\n41", "rebalance itself after one or several courses of antibiotics, but after\nrepeated or long-term courses\u2014and especially if the body has anunderlying immune dysfunction\u2014the yeast can get the upperhand.\nOther factors are also important. Studies have shown that ani-\nmals that are sleep-deprived and/or have increased sugar intakedevelop bowel yeast overgrowth. Many physicians feel that eatingsugar stimulates yeast overgrowth in people as well. Sugar is foodfor yeast. Y east ferment sugar in order to grow and multiply. Y eastovergrowth due to the overuse of sugar also seems to causeimmune suppression, which facilitates bacterial infections such aschronic sinusitis, requiring even more antibiotic use. Poor sleepalso results in marked suppression of your immune function.\nTreating Suspected Fungal Overgrowth Naturally. The \ufb01rst thing\nyou need to do is to stop feeding the yeast. Y east grow by eatingsugar and other sweets. Y ou can enjoy one or two pieces of fruita day, but you should not consume concentrated sugar sources suchas juices, corn syrup, jellies, pastry, candy, or honey. Stay far awayfrom soft drinks, which often have ten to twelve teaspoons ofsugar in every twelve ounces. This amount of sugar has beenshown to markedly suppress immune function for several hours.\nUsing stevia as a sweetener is a wonderful substitute for sugar.\nStevia is safe and natural, and you can use all you want. There areeven cookbooks available for using stevia. Most brands are bitter,and I don\u2019t recommend them. T wo brands taste great, however.These are the ones made by Body Ecology or the Stevita Com-pany (see Appendix B or vitality101.com).\nOther healthy natural sweeteners include maltitol (used in\nmany sugar-free chocolates), inositol, and xylitol. The yeast do notappear to be able to ferment these. In addition, inositol candecrease nerve pain and anxiety, and xylitol also appears todecrease osteoporosis. Be prepared to have withdrawal symptomsfor about one week when you cut sugar out of your diet. Severalexcellent books have been written on the yeast controversy andoffer additional dietary methods to try. One of the best is TheGENERAL PRINCIPLES OF PAIN RELIEF\n42", "Yeast Connection and the Woman by Dr. William Crook, a physi-\ncian who did a spectacular job of advancing our understanding ofthe problems caused by fungal overgrowth.\nAcidophilus\u2014milk bacteria, a healthy type of bacteria for the\nbowel\u2014helps restore balance in the bowel. Acidophilus is foundin yogurt with live and active yogurt cultures. Indeed, eating onecup of yogurt a day can markedly diminish the frequency ofrecurrent vaginal yeast infections. Acidophilus is also available inmany forms. Unfortunately, recent tests of many brands showedthat the quality control is very poor. The only forms of aci-dophilus that I currently recommend are those that have a pearlcoating to protect the bacteria and keep them alive such as Aci-dophilus Pearls, Probiotic Pearls, or a product called PrimalDefense. Take two pearls or two Primal Defense tablets twice aday for \ufb01ve months. This will help to restore the healthy bacteriain your colon that were destroyed by antibiotic use. Some peoplelike to continue on one pearl or tablet a day long term to helpmaintain healthy bowel function. If you are on antibiotics (notantifungals), take the acidophilus at least three to six hours awayfrom the antibiotic dose.\nAnother effective natural antifungal is Citricidal. Derived from\ngrapefruit and grapefruit seeds, it can be quite powerful at inhibit-ing fungal growth and the growth of other infections. Take oneor two 100 mg tablets twice a day. Do not use the liquid form, asit tastes vile. Many natural antifungals are available, but using astrong enough dose often causes stomach irritation and re\ufb02ux. Bycombining several antifungals at lower doses, one can increasetheir effectiveness with fewer side effects. Phytostan by NF For-mulas is an excellent mix of natural antifungals. These includegrapefruit seed extract, Pau d\u2019arco, caprylic acid, undecylenic acid,rosemary, and thyme. The recommended dose is one tablet, threetimes a day or two tablets, twice a day.\nMedical Treatments for Yeast Overgrowth. Nystatin, an antifun-\ngal medication, has been helpful in the treatment of yeast over-growth. Unfortunately, some fungi seem to be developingELIMINATING THE CAUSES AND TRIGGERS OF YOUR PAIN\n43", "resistance to nystatin. In addition, nystatin is poorly absorbed,\nwhich means that it has little impact on the yeast outside of thebowel. Other antifungal medications, such as Di\ufb02ucan and Spo-ranox, seem to be effective systemically (throughout the body),but they have two main drawbacks. First, they are expensive, cost-ing more than $450 to $900 for a two-month course. Happily,Di\ufb02ucan just went generic and can now be found for $40 permonth. Second, any effective antifungal can initially make thesymptoms of yeast infection worse. If you get this reaction, startyour treatment with Acidophilus, a sugar-free diet, plus Phytostanfor a few weeks before beginning the Nystatin and Di\ufb02ucan.\nAlthough it is uncommon, Di\ufb02ucan and Sporanox can also\ncause liver in\ufb02ammation. If you are taking Di\ufb02ucan or Sporanoxfor more than six to twelve weeks, I would consider intermittentblood tests to check liver function\u2014speci\ufb01cally checking bloodlevels of ALT and AST, two inexpensive tests and good indicatorsof injury to the liver. If you have preexisting active liver disease,you should be cautious about using Di\ufb02ucan or Sporanox\u2014or donot use them at all.\nI recommend taking 200 to 300 mg of lipoic acid a day when-\never you take Sporanox or Di\ufb02ucan. This is a natural supplementthat helps to protect and heal the liver (and can also be helpful fornerve pain). I also recommend lipoic acid for anyone with nervepain (200 to 300 mg two to three times a day) or active liver dis-ease such as hepatitis (at doses up to 1,000 to 3,000 mg a day) asit may prevent and/or help treat hepatitis and cirrhosis. (Furtherinformation is available at vitality101.com.)\nAvoiding Yeast Overgrowth. The best thing you can do to com-\nbat yeast overgrowth is to avoid it in the \ufb01rst place. When you geta viral infection, immediately begin treating it naturally. (See thesidebar \u201cTreating Respiratory Infections Without Antibiotics.\u201d)Hopefully, you will be able to prevent it from turning into a bac-terial infection that might require an antibiotic. Ask your doctorwhat other measures you can take before resorting to antibiotics.GENERAL PRINCIPLES OF PAIN RELIEF\n44", "ELIMINATING THE CAUSES AND TRIGGERS OF YOUR PAIN\nMany people do not realize how many things they can do before\nresorting to using an antibiotic to clear an infection. If you feel you\nare coming down with a respiratory infection such as a sore throat,\na cold, sinusitis, or the \ufb02u, I recommend that you try the following:\n\u2022Take a natural thymic hormone mimic. This is available as a\nproduct called ProBoost, which is a very effective immunestimulant (see Appendix B). At the \ufb01rst sign of any infection,\ndissolve the contents of one packet under your tongue three\ntimes a day and let it absorb there (any that is swallowed isdestroyed). I have found that using it for two or three days atthe onset of any infection can shorten the length of the\ninfection dramatically and often stops it on the \ufb01rst day.\n\u2022Take 1,000 to 8,000 mg of vitamin C a day. Take enough to get\ndiarrhea; then cut back to a comfortable level.\n\u2022If you have a sore throat, suck on a zinc lozenge \ufb01ve to eight\ntimes a day. Make sure that the lozenges have at least 10 to\n20 mg of zinc per lozenge. Less than this will not be effective.\nZinc lozenges have been known to speed the time it takes to\nrecover from a cold by about 40 percent. The Vitamin Shoppeand General Nutrition Center brands are excellent.\n\u2022Drink plenty of water and hot caffeine-free tea (or hot water\nwith lemon) and rest.\n\u2022Take Oscillococcinum. If you have \ufb02ulike symptoms such as\nchills, fever, achiness, and/or malaise, take Oscillococcinum, a\nhomeopathic remedy available at most health food stores and\nsome supermarkets. It speeds healing and eases discomfort. Itis best taken early in the infection\u2014as soon as you have any\nsymptoms.\n\u2022If you have a sinus infection, try nasal rinses. Dissolve a half\nteaspoon of salt in a cup of lukewarm water. Inhale some of theTreating Respiratory Infections \nWithout Antibiotics\n(continued)\n45", "GENERAL PRINCIPLES OF PAIN RELIEF\nsolution about one inch up into your nose, one nostril at a time.\nDo this either by using a baby nose bulb or an eyedropper\nwhile lying down, or by snif\ufb01ng the solution out of the palm of\nyour hand while standing by a sink. Then gently blow yournose, being careful not to hurt your ears. Repeat the same\nprocess with the other nostril. Continue to repeat with each\nnostril until the nose is clear. Rinse your nasal passages at leasttwice a day until the infection improves. Each rinsing will washaway about 90 percent of the infection and make it much easier\nfor your body to heal. Colloidal silver nose sprays can also help.\nAlso ask your doctor to prescribe the sinusitis nose spray fromCape Pharmacy (listed in Appendix B). In addition, see the\nsection later in this chapter on treating sinusitis.\n\u2022Try using a humidi\ufb01er or vaporizer in your bedroom. You can\nalso make a steam room by running a hot shower in your\nbathroom and then breathing in the steam. Or try using a\nsteam inhaler, such as the one available from BernhardIndustries. This is also wonderful for alleviating chronic andacute sinusitis.\nIf, in spite of these measures, nasal and lung mucus is yellow\nafter seven to fourteen days, or if you are feeling worse after three\nto four days, you may have to consider taking a course of\nantibiotics. If you do, you should take nystatin while on theantibiotic. Erythromycin antibiotics such as azithromycin (Zithromax)\nand clarithromycin (Biaxin) are usually preferable to penicillin\nantibiotics. Interestingly, my patients have sometimes found thatpain and many other symptoms (not just the cold) improve while\nthey are taking an erythromycin or tetracycline antibiotic. If that\nhappens, I recommend a six- to twenty-four-month course ofZithromax 250 mg per day, or 100 mg of doxycycline twice a day. If\nyou feel better on the antibiotic (take thymic hormone/ProBoost,Treating Respiratory Infections \nWithout Antibiotics, continued\n46", "ELIMINATING THE CAUSES AND TRIGGERS OF YOUR PAIN\nand the antifungal nystatin in conjunction with it), keep repeating\ntwelve-week courses until the symptoms stay gone. I would also\ncheck for Lyme disease, although the tests are not reliable. For\nmost of my patients who repeatedly get respiratory infections thatseem to take forever to go away, I consider an empiric trial of\nprescription hydrocortisone (Cortef) at a dosage of 7.5 mg in the\nmorning and 5 mg at noon for two to three months (see the earliersection on adrenal insuf\ufb01ciency).\nTo treat or prevent bladder infections caused by E. coli (the\nmost common cause), use the natural supplement D-Mannose.\nIf you \ufb01nd that you must take an antibiotic, all is not lost. You\ncan still lessen the severity of yeast overgrowth by avoiding sweets\nand by taking nystatin or Phytostan plus Acidophilus Pearls (again,\nnot within three to six hours of an antibiotic).\n47What if the Yeast Come Back? It is normal for yeast symptoms to\nresolve after treatment. After six weeks on Sporanox or Di\ufb02ucanmany people feel a lot better. However, symptoms may recur soonafter stopping the antifungal. If this happens, I would continuethe Sporanox or Di\ufb02ucan for another six weeks or for as long as isneeded to keep the symptoms at bay. More frequently, people feelbetter after treatment and stay feeling fairly well for a period ofsix to twenty-four months. At that time, we sometimes see arecurrence of symptoms, especially if the person is eating toomuch sugar or is taking antibiotics.\nThe best marker that I have found for recurrent yeast over-\ngrowth is a return of sinusitis or bowel symptoms, with gas, bloat-ing, diarrhea, and/or constipation. If these symptoms persist formore than two weeks, especially if there is even a mild worsen-ing of pain, fatigue, or mental cloudiness, it is reasonable to re-treat yourself with six weeks of acidophilus, nystatin or Phytostan,", "and Sporanox or Di\ufb02ucan. In addition, I would also resume treat-\nment if there is a recurrence of vaginal yeast or other fungal infec-tions. Y ou may repeat this regimen as needed. By using some ofthe natural remedies listed earlier in this chapter, however, youmay be able to avoid repeated use of antifungals and the possiblerisk of becoming resistant to them.\nAntibiotic-Sensitive Infections\nIn traditional medicine, physicians like to look for things that areeasy to test for. If we have no test for an infection, we makebelieve it does not exist. This was the case with polio, Lyme dis-ease, and numerous other infections until tests were developed.Physicians also like to look for infections that can be cultured.These include bacteria such as staph, strep, and E. coli . For these\ninfections, a few bacteria put on a culture dish will grow into mil-lions overnight, and these can then be seen with the naked eye. Isuspect that many kinds of in\ufb02ammatory arthritis (for example,rheumatoid arthritis) and autoimmune diseases are triggered bythe body\u2019s response to infections that we cannot yet culture.\nWhen to Treat with Antibiotics. Having just talked about the prob-\nlems of fungal overgrowth that occur with long-term or frequentantibiotic use, it may seem odd that we will now talk about thebene\ufb01ts of ongoing antibiotic use in some pain patients. This sim-ply helps to remind us that things are neither all good nor all bad.What is important is to use the right tool in the right situation.\nAs mentioned previously, pain may be a signal from your body\nthat there is an underlying infection that is problematic. In othercases, the pain is not caused by the infection but by your body\u2019sreaction as it attempts to \ufb01ght the infection. Unfortunately, themore commonly used antibiotics (penicillin, Ke\ufb02ex, sulfa) may beineffective against slow-growing infections. Research suggeststhat a trial of tetracycline-family antibiotics (and occasionallyantiparasitics) is warranted in the treatment of in\ufb02ammatoryarthritic conditions. I am most likely to consider a trial of six toGENERAL PRINCIPLES OF PAIN RELIEF\n48", "twelve months (or more) of these antibiotics in the following\nsituations:\n\u2022If you have recurrent low-grade fevers (which I de\ufb01ne as\nanything over 98.6\u00b0) and/or chronic lung congestionwithout your doctor \ufb01nding an underlying cause\n\u2022If your pain or other chronic symptoms improved (even\nbrie\ufb02y) while you were taking antibiotics for something else\n\u2022If you have rheumatoid arthritis or other in\ufb02ammatory\narthritis (where your joints are red, hot, and swollen) ofunknown cause\n\u2022If you have persistent sinusitis, skin/scalp pustules, or other\nchronic infections that persist after six weeks of antifungaltherapy\nPeople with these symptoms seem to be more likely to have bac-\nterial, mycoplasma, or chlamydia, or other infections that respondto special antibiotics.\nBowel Parasite Infections\nThe symptoms of parasitic infections can include pain. Asimmune dysfunction may be present in chronic pain patients, Ibelieve that all parasites should be treated.\nI am most likely to test for parasites in patients who have gas,\nbloating, diarrhea, and/or constipation\u2014especially if the symp-toms do not resolve with antifungal therapy, or if the person trav-eled overseas, or developed the bowel symptoms, in the weeks tomonths before the chronic pain began.\nDiagnosing and Treating Bowel Parasites. Most laboratories miss\nparasites when they do stool testing. The only labs that I use forstool testing (by mail) are the Parasitology Center and the GreatSmokies Diagnostic Laboratory (listed in Appendix B). The appro-priate treatment for many bowel parasites depends on which organ-ism is causing the problem. (Further information is available atELIMINATING THE CAUSES AND TRIGGERS OF YOUR PAIN\n49", "vitality101.com.) Prevent parasitic infection by \ufb01ltering your water\nwith an effective \ufb01ltration unit (most are not effective). I recom-mend the Multi-Pure \ufb01lter from Pure Water (see Appendix B).\nOther Infections\nWe will discuss speci\ufb01c infections such as sinusitis, bladder infec-tions, and prostatitis in the chapters on localized pain in Part II.In addition, many things determine how likely your body is toreact with a severe in\ufb02ammatory response and how much damagethis response is likely to do. Nutritional factors such as essentialfatty acids and antioxidants and hormonal factors such as inade-quate cortisol levels can dramatically modify your body\u2019s in\ufb02am-matory response.\nDetoxi\ufb01cation\nAlthough an extensive discussion of detoxi\ufb01cation is beyond thescope of this book, there are several simple things you can do thatcan be very helpful. Sweating can remove toxins, especially if youshower immediately after. Because of this, saunas can be very help-ful for health. With many of the newer far-infrared saunas, a half-hour sauna three to seven times a week may dramatically helpdetoxi\ufb01cation. My wife and I use an excellent one made by HighT ech Health (800-794-5355). Hot baths can also help. The follow-ing detox bath recipe was given to me by a wonderful osteopathicpractitioner, Anette Mnabhi, D.O., who practices in Montgomery,Illinois. Dr. Mnabhi\u2019s patients love it. She has seen one or twoinstances of nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea after the bath. In thesecases, however, the patient felt much better the next day.\nThis detox bath recipe helps with general muscle aches and\npains.\nDetox Bath Recipe\n2 cups Epsom salts\n1 cup baking soda\n1\u20443cup hydrogen peroxideGENERAL PRINCIPLES OF PAIN RELIEF\n50", "Fill the tub with hot water and add the above ingredients. Soak\nfor twenty to thirty minutes. Y ou will sweat in the tub and losetoxins. This causes you to lose some water as well, so it is impor-tant to drink plenty of water while you soak. Some people like toadd fresh lemon juice to their drinking water. If you have a ten-dency to get light-headed easily, be cautious when getting out ofthe tub, or have someone nearby the \ufb01rst time you take a detoxbath. Take a lukewarm to cool shower after getting out of the tubto rinse off the salts or you may itch. Rest for thirty minutes afterthe bath.\nReducing Stress (by Bren Jacobson)\nMost pain is part of a cycle that originates with stress that can bephysical, emotional, psychological, spiritual, or any combinationof these. Any kind of stress causes muscle tension and stiffness,which ultimately leads to permanent muscle tightness and even-tually immobility. This state of chronic contraction of the mus-cles and connective tissue leads to reduced blood \ufb02ow andoxygenation, along with an inability to get rid of toxic wasteproducts. All of these factors put strain on the body, causing it towork harder with less ef\ufb01ciency. This strain on the body causespain that interferes with sound, deep sleep. A lack of sleep lowersone\u2019s stress threshold, and this can become a downward spiral withpain levels increasing exponentially.\nT o reverse this cycle of stress, muscle tightness, pain, loss of\nsleep, and further stress, it is good to interrupt the cycle in asmany places as possible. I have found that prayer, meditation,counseling, lifestyle coaching, exercise, lovemaking, and doingthose activities that one enjoys are all effective ways of reducingstress. As discussed in the previous chapter, poor sleep can becounteracted by herbs, medicine, hot baths, soothing music, alight snack or warm milk. Muscle tightness as well as stressand pain can all be alleviated with bodywork, stretching, andexercise.ELIMINATING THE CAUSES AND TRIGGERS OF YOUR PAIN\n51", "Bodywork\nThe term bodywork generally refers to various types of massage\nand therapies performed on one\u2019s body. I will use it in a muchbroader sense and incorporate anything that affects and improvesthe body including various exercises. Before getting into the var-ious types, here are a few general suggestions that apply to allforms of bodywork.\n\u2022If it\u2019s not working, try something else. If you try any\nform of bodywork and \ufb01nd that you feel worse after a fairtrial, or it causes you continuing discomfort, or you simplydon\u2019t like it, stop and \ufb01nd something you enjoy more andhelps your situation. By a fair trial, I mean that if after oneyoga lesson you feel sore and stiff the next day, don\u2019t give up.Try it regularly, more slowly, for shorter periods of time, andmore gently for a month, and then if you don\u2019t feel that it ishelping, stop and try something else.\n\u2022Always start gradually. Don\u2019t start with three or four\nhours of exercise a day. T wenty minutes of yoga every day isbetter than \ufb01ve hours on the weekend. A daily walk aroundthe block is better than running a marathon once a year. Doonly what feels good and do it only as long as it is enjoyable.\n\u2022Get references. T o \ufb01nd a good therapist or teacher, ask\nfriends for references, check the person\u2019s credentials, and talkto the person to see if you are compatible with them.\n\u2022Check with your doctor. If you have any sort of medical\ncondition, check with your doctor to see if the type ofbodywork you are considering is appropriate and has nopotential to do harm.\n\u2022Always listen to the messages that your body and\nintuition give you. Pay attention to what your body is\ntelling you. Y ou live in your body and have a very intimateknowledge of what is good or bad for it. People often getinto trouble when they ignore what their bodies are tryingto tell them. When one doesn\u2019t listen to one\u2019s body, it oftenGENERAL PRINCIPLES OF PAIN RELIEF\n52", "gives louder, more insistent, and harder to ignore messages\nin the form of pain or disabilities that prevent one fromdoing further damage (like a fuse blowing to prevent a \ufb01rein an electrical system). The Chinese have a saying that isapplicable, \u201cA stumble very often prevents a fall.\u201d\n\u2022Never push yourself, never show off, and never, ever\ncompete with anyone while exercising. If you are in a\nyoga class and the person on the mat next to you is doing aforward bend with her hands \ufb02at on the \ufb02oor and her headtouching her knees, and you can barely touch your toes, itdoesn\u2019t matter at all. The purpose of the exercise is not totouch the \ufb02oor or your toes but to stretch the muscles ofyour back. Forcing yourself can cause severe injury.\n\u2022Forget the adage \u201cno pain, no gain.\u201d It has no truth \nand often causes painful injuries. \u201cSlow, gradual, andcomfortable\u201d is a much better and safer approach.\n\u2022Always warm up before exercise or athletics with\nslow, gentle movements and stretches. This is one of\nthe best ways to avoid injury. It is equally important to cooldown after exercise. Some form of complete relaxation is agood way to end your workout.\n\u2022Natural activity is good. Any natural activity that uses\nyour entire body, does not involve extreme exertion, doesnot involve high impact, and which is fun is probably goodfor you. Some examples of this are walking (one of the best,easiest, cheapest, and most readily available activities foralmost everyone), swimming, dancing, making love,gardening, and bicycling. It is a good practice to alternatethese activities so as to achieve a good balance in your body.Some of the activities that I have found to cause pain andinjury are lifting heavy weights, running, and ballet.Running often causes lower back pain, disc compression,and damage (the impact on the spine when running is threetimes the body weight). It also causes stress fractures, tornligaments, and knee damage (knees incur \ufb01ve times theELIMINATING THE CAUSES AND TRIGGERS OF YOUR PAIN\n53", "amount of force when running as they do when walking). I\nhave worked with numerous ballet dancers and weight liftersand have seen many who are totally disabled and many whoare in constant, unbearable, and intractable pain.\nMovement, Exercise, and Bodywork. In this section I will give a\nbasic overview of a few types of bodywork that can be effectivein relieving pain, and I will recommend some books as I go.Movement and exercise include such disciplines as yoga, tai chichuan, chi gong, Pilates, and others.\nThe most complete and time-tested system of exercise is yoga.\nIt combines balance, stretching, resistance, breathing, and focus.T oday, yoga has gone from being an esoteric spiritual practice tobeing commonplace. There are many different types of yoga, andmost of them have bene\ufb01t. A good type of yoga for anyone start-ing out is a gentle form of hatha yoga. Sivananda yoga, a popularand comprehensive form of hatha yoga, is described in SwamiVishnu Devananda\u2019s Complete Illustrated Book of Yoga and in The\nSivananda Companion to Yoga . The Sivananda organization has\ncenters throughout the world that give classes, train teachers, andoffer yoga vacations and retreats. More information can be foundonline at sivananda.org. The advanced student can go on to tryBikram yoga, Iyengar yoga (explained in the book Light on Yoga ),\nastanga yoga, Kundalini yoga, and Anusara yoga.\nIdeally, the student will not just use yoga as a series of exer-\ncises, but will also become acquainted with the yoga diet, philos-ophy, lifestyle, breathing exercises, and meditation. All of thesecomprise a system that is extremely effective in relieving, as wellas preventing, pain. It is possible to begin practicing yoga from abook, but it is much better to start by taking a class from a certi-\ufb01ed teacher. It is important to begin gently, to never compete, tonever force a posture to the point of pain, and to do all of theexercises mindfully. Done properly, yoga will be enjoyable.\nIn yoga as well as all forms of exercise, correct breathing is of\nthe utmost importance. Breath is a link between the mind andGENERAL PRINCIPLES OF PAIN RELIEF\n54", "body. When the body is in pain or the mind is frightened, breath-\ning is short, rapid, and irregular. If a person is relaxed and in a stateof enjoyment, breathing is long, slow, deep, and regular. It is pos-sible to change one\u2019s state of being by simply focusing on andchanging one\u2019s breathing. Practitioners of zazen, one of the mosteffective forms of meditation, as well as vipassana meditation usethis concentration on their breath as a major part of their practice.A powerful way of dealing with pain is to visualize the breath asa colored healing stream of energy and to concentrate on direct-ing the breath to the part of the body where the pain is. Imaginethe healing energy of the breath dissolving the pain and carryingit out of the body with each exhalation.\nAnother breathing practice that can be useful and which is an\nessential part of a c omplete yoga practice is called pranayama. This\nconsists of a series of powerful breathing exercises that arouse andcontrol the \ufb02ow of energy in the body. In any exercise, it isimportant when bending forward to exhale and to inhale whenbending backward. It is also good to coordinate the breath withthe motion so that when you begin to bend forward, you beginto exhale, ending the exhalation when you reach the limit of yourforward bend.\nAnother wonderful system of bodywork is tai chi chuan. It is,\nall at the same time, an exercise, a dance, a moving meditation, asystem of energy generation and regulation, breath control, and amartial art. It was developed over thousands of years by Chinesemonks and is practiced throughout China by millions of people.It consists of a series of many \u201chands\u201d or postures and movementslinked together in a very slow, harmonious, and graceful dance.T oday there are numerous books and videos that teach variousforms of tai chi, but it is very dif\ufb01cult to learn it that way. Myadvice is to join a class that proceeds slowly and rigorously. Forhealth and pain relief purposes, it is better to avoid schools thatteach tai chi as a martial art.\nSimilar to tai chi is another Chinese practice called chi gong.\nThis is a type of healing that can be performed by a practitionerELIMINATING THE CAUSES AND TRIGGERS OF YOUR PAIN\n55", "and is also a system of exercise, with more emphasis on healing\nand controlling the \ufb02ow of energy in the body. An excellentintroduction to the philosophy, history, and practice of chi gongcan be found in books by Ken Cohen.\nPilates is a system of bodywork that is enjoying increasing\npopularity in the United States. It c omplements the other systems\nof bodywork that I have mentioned and is taught in many gymsand spas. Pilates is somewhat vigorous and should be done bysomeone who is already fairly healthy. As with other forms ofbodywork, it is of the utmost importance to work with a prop-erly trained and experienced teacher.\nThere are various other forms of bodywork that focus on\nproper and ef\ufb01cient ways to move and use one\u2019s body. Theseinclude Feldenkrais work, Alexander technique, Rolf movementwork, Trager Mentastics, and Aston patterning. Some types ofbodywork performed by a practitioner focus primarily on thephysical body and others concentrate on the body\u2019s energy sys-tem. In all cases, however, there is an overlap. For example, acu-puncture is primarily a way of enhancing the proper \ufb02ow ofenergy in the body, but it also effects physical change. Likewise,structural integration/Rol\ufb01ng, which works only on the physicalbody, always affects the energy system.\nFurthermore, anything that changes the body physically not\nonly changes a person\u2019s structure and physiology, but also changesthe person emotionally and psychologically. We are all familiarwith the term psychosomatic , meaning bodily symptoms caused by\nmental or emotional disturbance. The reverse phenomenon ofphysical improvement causing a corresponding psychologicalimprovement, or somatopsychic , is not as universally recognized. An\nanalogy I use to illustrate this phenomenon is that the body and themind are like the back and the palm of the hand. Both are sepa-rate, distinct, different, and distinguishable, but it is impossible tomove or in any way change one without a corresponding changein the other. They are inextricably linked. Just think about the lasttime you hit your \ufb01nger with a hammer or stubbed your toe.GENERAL PRINCIPLES OF PAIN RELIEF\n56", "Massage Therapies That Involve Bodywork. Before discussing var-\nious types of bodywork and massage, I would like to give a fewcautionary notes. Anyone with open sores, an infectious disease,severe psychological imbalance, a fracture or other serious injury,an acute illness, or a pain or other symptom that is increasing infrequency or severity should see a physician before trying any ofthe following therapies. If you have acute appendicitis or hepati-tis, for example, an acupuncturist, chiropractor, or re\ufb02exologistwould not be the appropriate therapist to go to.\nOver a period of thirty-\ufb01ve years I have studied and practiced\nmany forms of bodywork worldwide, and I now work with myown fusion of all of them. If, however, I were to be asked whichsingle form of bodywork I \ufb01nd most profoundly effective inrelieving pain as well as enhancing well-being and vitality, Iwould recommend structural integration. This is a holistic systemof balancing and integrating the body that was developed by Dr.Ida P . Rolf and which has been called Rol\ufb01ng by many of itspractitioners to honor her.\nI had the great honor of studying advanced Rol\ufb01ng with Dr.\nRolf and have practiced it for more than thirty years. I \ufb01nd it tobe the most holistic, long lasting, and transformative form ofbodywork available. An excellent source of information aboutstructural integration is available online at rolfguild.org. Excellentbooks on the subject are available. T wo of the best are Rol\ufb01ng:\nReestablishing the Natural Alignment and Structural Integration of theHuman Body for Vitality and Well-Being and Rol\ufb01ng and Physical\nReality , both by Dr. Ida P . Rolf.\nStructural integration involves ten sessions of work with most\nof the work being done with connective tissue to straighten andbalance the body so that it gets support from gravity, rather thanbeing torn down by it. The results that most people get arereduced pain, more energy, better posture, and less anxiety, as wellas easier, more ef\ufb01cient, and more graceful movement. A fairlycommon remark by people who have had this work done is thatthey feel more attractive, have more energy, and feel healthier.ELIMINATING THE CAUSES AND TRIGGERS OF YOUR PAIN\n57", "Because so much pain and dysfunction is caused by imbalance and\nstructural problems, such as one leg being shorter than the other,uneven hip heights, the head being forward, the pelvis tilted, orthe shoulders rotated, this is an extremely effective approach foralleviating these problems and the pain caused by them.\nMassage is a broad category of bodywork that involves hands-\non manipulation. It is one of the oldest forms of healing and hasbeen used from time immemorial. T oday there are scores of dif-ferent schools of massage. One of the best introductions to thevarious types is the book Hands on Healing by Jack Angelo.\nOne wide group of massage techniques uses stroking, friction,\nkneading, and vibration. This relaxes muscles and increases bloodand lymph \ufb02ow, while increasing oxygenation of the tissues of thebody. This type of work generally relieves muscular tension andleaves the person feeling relaxed and energized at the same time.This category includes Swedish massage, sports massage, Esalenmassage, tuina (a type of Chinese massage), and lymphaticdrainage massage.\nAdditional Bodywork Therapies. Other forms of bodywork focus\non regulating and directing the \ufb02ow of energy in the body. Theseinclude acupuncture, re\ufb02exology, shiatsu, polarity work, do-in,and applied kinesiology. Thai massage is explained well in thebook Thai Massage: Sacred Bodywork by Ananda Apfelbaum.\nVarious types of bodywork mobilize joints and release muscles,\nwhile straightening and balancing the spine. These include chiro-practic work, osteopathy, Trager, and cranial-sacral work. The\ufb01rst two are very complementary to the therapies mentionedabove. A Canadian study recommended chiropractic treatment asan effective \ufb01rst-line treatment for acute back pain. The latter twoare both very gentle and powerful.\nHow to Use Bodywork for Optimum Effect. Any and all of these\nsystems and techniques will help to relieve pain but obviously noGENERAL PRINCIPLES OF PAIN RELIEF\n58", "person has the time, money, or energy to do them all. Nor are all\ntypes of work suited to all people. It is best to talk to other peo-ple and health practitioners as well as read more about these heal-ing modalities and then try one. If it helps, keep doing it, and ifnot, try another. Never get discouraged. Each type of bodyworkwill help in some way and each will teach you something aboutyourself.\nI would like to note that many of the things I have mentioned\nare synergistic. This means that they work together and enhanceeach other so that the total effect is greater than each done sepa-rately. In other words the total effect is greater than the sum ofthe parts. A combination that I have found to be particularlyeffective is yoga, structural integration, meditation, and tai chi.\nThe Bene\ufb01ts of Meditation for Stress Reduction\nMany associate meditation with someone who shaves his or herhead and bangs a tambourine in an airport or someone who sits ina cave contemplating his navel. The truth is that every religiousand spiritual tradition worldwide advocates some form of medi-tation. There are also many individuals with no religious or spir-itual aspirations who meditate for reasons that are as varied aslowering their blood pressure to improving their golf game. Manyrecent studies have shown the bene\ufb01ts of meditation to be as far-ranging as increasing life expectancy, stress and pain control, bet-ter immune function, lower blood pressure, increased fertility, lessPMS, and fewer headaches.\nWhat I mean by meditation is one-pointed, focused mindful-\nness and awareness. This can be visual concentration on a candle\ufb02ame or religious icon or an auditory input, such as wholeheart-edly listening to a Gregorian chant or the waves on a beach. Theverbal or silent repetition of a mantra is another form of medita-tion. Some people \ufb01nd the repetition of a word like \u201cpeace\u201d help-ful. This is talked about in Dr. Herb Benson\u2019s book The Relaxation\nResponse . Others recite the rosary or a syllable such as \u201cOm,\u201d orELIMINATING THE CAUSES AND TRIGGERS OF YOUR PAIN\n59", "they repeat their name over and over as did Alfred Lord T ennyson.\nMindful meditation can involve a kinesthetic experience such aswalking or doing an everyday task such as gardening or washingdishes with full attention and awareness. The secret is to \u201cdo onething.\u201d In other words, when you are washing dishes, focus onlyon doing the dishes. Be aware of the sound of the water, the feelof the dishes, the way your muscles work to accomplish the task,the smell of the soap, and the appearance of the soap bubbles. Ifyour back becomes tired, be aware of that in an observant ratherthan a judgmental way. When you are doing the dishes think, \u201cIam doing the dishes.\u201d Try not to let the usual useless mind chat-ter take over, such as, \u201cBoy, I wish I didn\u2019t have to do the dishes;I wonder what\u2019s on television; I wish I had said such and such toso and so earlier today; wouldn\u2019t it be great if I had a dishwasher;maybe I should use paper plates.\u201d If these thoughts intrude, justlet them go without judging yourself for losing focus and get backto \u201cwashing the dishes.\u201d\nObserving, concentrating, and becoming one with one\u2019s\nbreathing are all part of another form of meditation. One of thebest practical manuals for this form of meditation, called zazen, isPhilip Kapleau\u2019s The Three Pillars of Zen . Another very good\nintroduction to meditation is Mindfulness Meditation: Cultivating\nthe Wisdom of Your Body and Mind by Jon Kabat Zinn.\nThe Bene\ufb01ts of Sex for Stress Reduction\nLast but not least, I have alluded to the bene\ufb01ts of sex. I would\nlike to expand on what I mean by this. T o begin with, I am talk-ing about more than a simple orgasmic release. I am speakingabout all forms of physical give-and-take in a loving relationship.This can range from wild sex to a simple foot massage. There havebeen an increasing number of studies from such conservative bas-tions as Johns Hopkins and Dartmouth as to the physical and emo-tional health bene\ufb01ts of this kind of relationship and its ability tomaintain well-being and reduce pain. Part of this has to do withGENERAL PRINCIPLES OF PAIN RELIEF\n60", "the release of neurotransmitters such as endorphins and oxytocin,\nbut the cardiovascular bene\ufb01ts, not to mention the pleasurederived, cause a cascade of health-promoting effects from bettersleep to improved immune function. There is even proof that fre-quent sex increases growth hormone levels, resulting in less pain,weight loss, a more youthful appearance, and even an increase inlife expectancy!\nConsidering Ergonomics (by Bren Jacobson)\nErgonomics refers to the science of engineering, adapting, anddesigning machines, tools, and furniture to suit people andincrease ef\ufb01ciency. I will use the term here in its broader sense toinclude the ways in which individuals adapt themselves to theirenvironment and work.\nEven very subtle imbalances in our bodies or in the way we\nuse them can cause severe pain. Dr. Rolf taught that the con-nective tissue in the body forms a continuous web so that anyinjury, strain, or in\ufb02ammation is instantly and lastingly commu-nicated to the entire body. She often used the analogy of tryingto straighten out a wrinkled bedsheet; as soon as one tugs on onecorner of the sheet to get rid of a crease, it causes another creasesomewhere else.\nA more practical example of this principle is illustrated in what\nhappens to a woman\u2019s body when she wears high-heeled shoes.The most energy ef\ufb01cient and comfortable way to stand is verti-cally. When high-heeled shoes are worn, the woman\u2019s weight isshifted forward to a fairly small area on the ball of the foot. T omake matters worse, the toes are jammed into the front of theshoe, causing bunions that are both painful and unattractive. Inaddition, there is excess tension in the ankle, which causes immo-bility in the joint. Because of the elevation of the heel, the calfmuscle and Achilles tendon shorten, causing increased stress onthe knee. With the weight and therefore the pelvis being shiftedELIMINATING THE CAUSES AND TRIGGERS OF YOUR PAIN\n61", "forward, the shoulders come back and the head goes forward to\ncompensate. The pelvis also tilts forward creating a lordosis (sway-back) and causing the abdomen to protrude, making the personlook many pounds heavier than she actually is. The long-termeffects of simply elevating the heels a few inches are almost invari-ably lower back, upper back, and neck pain, as these are the partsof the body that have to constantly do extra work to compensatefor the imbalance created by the shoes. A whole constellation ofsecondary pains and other symptoms can arise from this appar-ently simple cause, including headaches, knee pain, imbalance,pain in the jaw, poor digestion, and fatigue.\nThe feet are the only interface that we have with the earth.\nThey are, in other words, our sole foundation and support for theentire body. If we do not have proper weight distribution, \ufb02exi-bility, contact, and support from our feet, our entire body will suf-fer. We will become \u201cungrounded.\u201d\nAs an interesting example of synchronicity, just after \ufb01nishing\nthe paragraphs above I stopped writing to read the New York\nTimes \u2019s science section and came across the article \u201cIn the Relent-\nless Pursuit of Fashion, the Feet Pay the Price.\u201d The article quotedthe president of the Podiatric Medical Association as saying, \u201cthecurrent trend in fashion is very bad for women\u2019s feet.\u201d He andother medical experts said that poorly designed and \ufb01tting shoesthat included not only high heels, but \ufb02ip-\ufb02ops, some runningshoes, and platform shoes, cause the problems that I have alreadymentioned as well as causing nerve damage. These shoes make thewearer more prone to accidents and ankle sprains. They upset thestabilizing mechanics of the foot, contributing to arthritis, inhibit-ing range of motion, causing loss of toe strength, shin splints, andfoot deformities such as bunions and hammer toes as well as plan-tar fascial tears and fasciitis (pain along the soles of the feet).\nAnother example of an ergonomic problem is that of a man\nwho came to see me in Holland. For over twelve years he had suf-fered from extreme and constant pains in his neck, in his shoul-GENERAL PRINCIPLES OF PAIN RELIEF\n62", "ders, and between his shoulder blades, as well as unbearable\nmigraine headaches. He had gone to over forty healers, includingneurologists, surgeons, shamans, and hypnotists. No one hadhelped him. As I took his history, I asked what kind of work hedid. He replied that he played cello for the Amsterdam Concerte-bau Orchestra and he practiced four to six hours a day. I thenasked him to pretend that he was playing his cello so that I couldsee how he was using his body. When he did this, I observed thathe bent forward at the waist, hunched his shoulders, and broughthis head forward. All of this was obviously the cause of his prob-lems, and I asked him why he didn\u2019t sit erect. He replied that thecello was low and he was tall, and hence he had always playedhunched over. I suggested that he was intelligent enough to \ufb01g-ure out a way to raise the cello. As it turned out there is a pegunder the cello that adjusts its height. He went home and adjustedthe height of his cello. He called me a week later and said that bysimply sitting erect while playing, his pain had gone from beingtortuous to only a mild annoyance, his headaches had disappeared,and his teacher had remarked that his playing was much improved(because he was no longer \u201cwrapped\u201d around the instrument andhad more freedom in his arms and shoulders).\nI could go on with endless examples of people that I have\ncounseled who have suffered years of torment because of a poorlyplaced computer monitor, a piece of furniture that didn\u2019t suitthem, an activity they performed in the wrong way, or trying todo a job with an inappropriate or poorly designed tool. I suggestthe following guidelines to help you avoid these problems.\nKeep a Daily Ergonomics Journal\nRate whatever pain or discomfort you have on a scale of 1 to 10,with 1 being no pain and 10 being excruciating pain. This can bedone at any time of the day, but the end of the day is a good timeand it is preferable to do it at the same time each day if possible. Onany day that your pain level is low (1 to 3) or high (7 to 10) try toELIMINATING THE CAUSES AND TRIGGERS OF YOUR PAIN\n63", "examine and record any variables that might make that day differ-\nent from others. Some things you might consider are the following:\n\u2022Is it a workday or a holiday? Do you have a new job,\ndifferent work, or increased responsibilities?\n\u2022Are you on vacation or just returning from one?\n\u2022Have you been doing a different activity than usual, or are\nyou doing a normal activity in a different way or with adifferent tool?\n\u2022Did you have a deadline that you had to rush to meet, or did\nyou have suf\ufb01cient time to complete your tasks?\n\u2022Were you juggling too many different jobs?\n\u2022What have your interpersonal relationships been like that day?\n\u2022Have you been using a different piece of furniture than\nusual? It is particularly important, if you have pain, to noticeif you are better or worse when sleeping away from homeon a different bed.\n\u2022What types of stress have you been subjected to that day?\nAre any of them new or different? If you have encounteredyour usual stresses, have you dealt with them differently?\n\u2022Is the weather (barometric pressure, temperature, wind, or\nhumidity) particularly different?\n\u2022Has your diet changed in either type of food, quantity, or\nquality?\n\u2022Has anything in your work or home environment changed?\nThis could be anything from more noise to new furniture,lighting, carpeting, or paint.\n\u2022Are you using a different car, bike, golf clubs, tennis racket,\ntelephone, shoes, and so on?\nWhen you are able to identify any variable that affects your level\nof pain, vitality, wellness, and sense of well-being, avoid it, changeit, or do more of it as is appropriate.\nY ou may think that the previously mentioned points are obvi-\nous and not worth wasting time on, but I can assure you that thisGENERAL PRINCIPLES OF PAIN RELIEF\n64", "is not the case. I have counseled thousands of people and can tell\nhundreds of stories like the one above about the Dutch cellist whorelieved years of pain by playing detective and \ufb01nding the factorsthat caused his pain. It is particularly important to keep a writtenjournal on a daily basis, because on the days that the pain is severeit can be so distracting that you wouldn\u2019t think of trying to trackdown the cause of your pain. On days when you feel good, it iscommon to forget that you ever had pain and you don\u2019t want toexpend the energy to think about it.\nVary Your Work and Play\nOne of my teachers said that \u201cthe best vacation is a change ofwork.\u201d There is much truth in the saying. Instead of spending awhole day cleaning the house and another day gardening and yetanother day doing paperwork, it is far preferable to spend a shortertime doing each and then switching. This enables you to not onlyuse different muscle groups, but different mind functions. It alsocreates a relaxing change of pace and prevents ennui.\nEven if you are doing everything right, one risk that comes of\nnot varying activities is the possibility of straining muscles andtendons through the excessive repetition of a movement\u2014knownas repetitive use syndrome. If you are doing anything that is repet-itive, try to switch, at least temporarily, to a different activity atthe \ufb01rst indication of any physical strain or discomfort.\nEqually important is to intersperse work periods with time\nspent in play, relaxation, exercise, entertainment, and meditationor reverie. One of the most invigorating and healing practices is atwenty-minute afternoon siesta or nap. Not everyone has the lux-ury to indulge in this, but even having lunch in a park or quietplace instead of a busy restaurant can be bene\ufb01cial.\nBecome Aware of What Your Body Is Telling You\nAt the risk of sounding repetitive, I will say that one of the mostimportant things you can do is to listen to your body. Our bod-ies communicate with us through aches, pains, pleasures, resist-ELIMINATING THE CAUSES AND TRIGGERS OF YOUR PAIN\n65", "ances to certain activities, or reactions to different conditions. The\nbody has its own wisdom and very often, even though it doesn\u2019thave warning lights like your car, it will through various meansattempt to communicate with you. T o expand on this car analogy,if you race your engine constantly or subject it to long periods ofdisuse, use the wrong fuel, or neglect preventative maintenance,you will eventually have a breakdown. If this seems a silly anal-ogy, consider that many of the people that I work with routinelychecked their car\u2019s tire pressure but have never had their bloodpressure checked. Others wouldn\u2019t think of using low-test gaso-line but regularly eat junk food. Still others never go more thansix months without having their automobile serviced but haven\u2019thad a physical checkup in years.\nI have learned over the years that when the body gives a sub-\ntle hint or message that is ignored by its owner, it will continueto give the same message in a different way or at increased vol-ume. If it is still ignored it will continuously try to make its mes-sage clear. If the person still does not pay attention, it will try tomake it impossible for the person to persist in the activity that maybe endangering him or her. One example is the person who isoverexerting himself on a constant basis. The body\u2019s \ufb01rst messagemight be lethargy, discomfort, or mild digestive upset. When thatperson ignores these conditions and continues to work too long,too hard, or too constantly, the pain, tiredness, and indigestionwill most certainly grow worse. If these indications are ignored,the body in its wisdom realizes that the path that the person ispersisting on may lead to severe repercussions such as a nervousbreakdown, loss of job or relationship, or even a life-threateningoccurrence such as a heart attack. At that point the body puts intoplay some form of circuit breaker that forces the person to stopwhat he is doing. This can take the form of headaches, back pain,chronic fatigue, \ufb01bromyalgia, or irritable bowel syndrome. It ismuch better to heed the early warning signals we get from ourbodies and moderate our behavior than it is to deal with thesemore serious conditions.GENERAL PRINCIPLES OF PAIN RELIEF\n66", "Y ou are your body and, if you pay close attention to it, you\nwill often become aware of problems long before a diagnostic test,x-ray, or doctor\u2019s exam will. This doesn\u2019t mean that you shouldnot talk to your doctor about your concerns. As many spiritualtraditions have held, the body is the temple of the soul. It shouldnever be disregarded, and anyone who does, does so at his or herown risk.\nUse Your Body and Enjoy It\nThe same goes for your mind and spirit. Don\u2019t become a couchpotato. One of the best ways to stay healthy and young is to con-stantly try new activities, meet new people, explore new places,try new foods, keep in touch with old friends and family, read newbooks, and be of service to those who are less fortunate or capa-ble than you. Use it or lose it. I would not be so presumptuous asto believe that I know what the true meaning of life is or what theideal way to live is, but I am absolutely sure that it is not aboutdoing as little as possible while accumulating as much as possible.I am sure that service, knowledge, home, family, friends, com-munity, and relationships in general are much more importantthan most other things that people strive for. They are also morehealing and bring more happiness. Many spend their lives strivingfor wealth, thinking that money will bring happiness. Truewealth, however, is not getting what you want but wanting whatyou have.\nAfter thirty-\ufb01ve years as a healer I can say with great convic-\ntion that the four best medicines for pain are laughter, sleep, tears,and loving, although not necessarily in that order. They also arenecessary to create true health, wholeness, and happiness.\nFind a Better Way to Do Things That Cause You Pain\nIf doing any activity causes pain, and you must do it, \ufb01nd a bet-ter way to do it. T oday there are many devices that make variousactivities, from opening a bottle to digging in the garden, easier.These devices can be found in various catalogs or on the Internet.ELIMINATING THE CAUSES AND TRIGGERS OF YOUR PAIN\n67", "One good example of this is the Jar Key. It is a simple device that\nbreaks the vacuum seal on food jars. This enables one to removethe lid with minimal effort and no torquing force on the wrist.Sometimes a little bit of ingenuity goes a long way. Very often byusing a lever, wedge, or pulley, you can reduce the effort neces-sary to do a job to a fraction of what it might have been.\nAlso, when lifting, keep your back straight and your feet apart\nto give yourself a broad, stable foundation. When lifting things,turn your entire body, using your legs rather than twisting yourspine. If you can push or pull or slide an object instead of lifting,do that. If you can put something under the object to be movedto reduce friction, do so.\nFind the Most Comfortable Furniture for You\nRemember the adage that \u201cone man\u2019s meat is another\u2019s poison.\u201dThere is not any one shoe, mattress, diet, therapy, exercise pro-gram, climate, career, or lifestyle that is perfect or right for every-one, despite advertising claims to the contrary. I remember a manI Rolfed in Spain. He suffered severe burning and pain on gettingup in the morning. I suspected a bad mattress and suggested tohim that this might be the source of his problem. He was positivethe mattress could not possibly be the problem because it had costsix thousand dollars, had been designed by Germany\u2019s mostfamous orthopedic surgeon, and had been prescribed by Spain\u2019stop back specialist. He even brought me to his home to examineit and try it out. I laid down on it and it was a very comfortable,supportive, \ufb01rm mattress, and I had to agree with him that it wasprobably not the cause of his pain. I Rolfed him, which was ben-e\ufb01cial for his general well-being and his back, but he still had theburning sensation when he woke up. He later tried chiropractic,acupuncture, Mezier work, and physical therapy with the sameresults. I ran into him a year and a half later and he told me thatthe burning sensation had disappeared. I immediately thought thatthe Rol\ufb01ng, which usually takes a full year after the work is \ufb01n-ished to manifest its full bene\ufb01t, had \ufb01nally done the trick. He toldGENERAL PRINCIPLES OF PAIN RELIEF\n68", "me that what had really made the most difference was going to a\nhotel that had cheap, soft, sagging mattresses, which evidentlysuited him better then the super expensive one that he hadimported from Germany.\nAlways buy for comfort, adjustability, and functionality rather\nthan cost, an expert\u2019s opinion, a brand name, appearance, or fash-ion. Much of the furniture that is available today is overstuffedand too soft to give proper support, or it is of an extreme shapethat would look good in an art museum but is not suited to thehuman body. Very often the best chair is a simple old-fashioned,straight-backed chair. Instead of buying the fanciest sports car,buy one that you can drive without getting back pain. A simplerule of thumb is to \u201ctry before you buy\u201d (or be sure that you cantake it back if it turns out to be unsuitable). If you are buying acar, try renting that model \ufb01rst and drive \ufb01ve hundred miles, andsee how your back feels at the end of the trip. When buying achair that you might spend 20 percent of the rest of your life in,go to the store and sit in every chair until you \ufb01nd the one thatis most comfortable. Sit in that one for an hour or so and read amagazine and see how you feel at the end of that period. Shoes,which I have already spoken of at length, can cause more prob-lems than any other item people use. They should always be cho-sen for comfort before any other consideration. The thing youare using should not only be appropriate for you but also theactivity it is being used for. For instance, running shoes are notappropriate for hiking.\nAnother good general rule is to buy the item that is the most\nadjustable and customizable. If you buy a computer desk, forinstance, buy one on which the height of the monitor and thekeyboard can be adjusted independently. When shopping for anof\ufb01ce chair, look for one that can be adjusted for the height of theseat, the height of the arms, the height and amount of lumbar sup-port, and the amount of tilt as well as the force needed to changethe tilt. Likewise, the more separate adjustments an automobileseat has, the easier it is to make it comfortable for your body. TheELIMINATING THE CAUSES AND TRIGGERS OF YOUR PAIN\n69", "more customizable anything is, the easier it is to get it to work\nef\ufb01ciently with your body.\nBilaterally Balance Physical Activities\nFor example, if you are carrying something like a shopping bag,switch hands frequently (the tendency is always to use your dom-inant or strong side, which increases imbalance), divide the loadinto two bags, use a backpack, or, ideally, use a wheeled cart.\nOne of the most common problems I see is neck and back pain\ncaused by of\ufb01ce workers holding their telephone receiver withtheir shoulder while using a keyboard. This is very easily dealtwith by getting a headset from a store like Radio Shack, Best Buy,or Circuit City. Almost all cordless and cellular phones have jacksfor a headset, and Radio Shack has regular phones with headsets.Another solution is using a speaker phone, and GE makes onewith good sound quality that I bought for twelve dollars.\nLose the Extra Weight\nFinally, one stress factor that is frequently overlooked is that ofexcessive weight, which can sap one\u2019s energy and cause harmfulwear and tear in the joints. Every extra pound of weight a personcarries causes four pounds of pressure in the knee. This in itselfcan cause extreme pain.\nGetting Help\nAs we\u2019ve seen in the last two sections, it is important to addressboth stress and structural issues. I have found Bren Jacobson to bean extraordinarily gifted counselor who can help with both psy-chological counseling and guiding people through the myriadhealth-care options that are available (see Appendix B).\nDealing with Trauma\nTrauma can also cause pain by many mechanisms, so I want tobrie\ufb02y touch on it here. Initially it can cause in\ufb02ammation ordirect tissue injury. If bleeding occurs into the area, the iron inGENERAL PRINCIPLES OF PAIN RELIEF\n70", "the blood can actually continually trigger in\ufb02ammation (iron is\n\u201cpro oxidative\u201d). This ongoing in\ufb02ammation can be shut down\nby using antioxidants. Nutritional and sleep remedies also supportthe healing of injuries. Often, an injured muscle can get stuck ina shortened position, causing years or decades of pain.\nUsing some simple physical therapy techniques such as stretch\nand spray (where a special, cold spray administered by a therapistto the painful area temporarily blocks the pain), the shortenedmuscles can often be released in a matter of seconds or minutes\u2014often with instantaneous relief of what had been chronic pain.Sometimes this is all that is needed for permanent pain relief.Other times, the muscle again contracts to the shortened position,causing pain. This problem (of recurrent pain) often respondsbeautifully to nutritional, sleep, and hormonal support, and toeliminating underlying infections as discussed earlier. It is alsoimportant, of course, to treat any structural abnormalities.\nIce and heat can both be helpful for a trauma injury. Ice works\nbest for the \ufb01rst twenty-four to thirty-six hours after acuteinjuries or for problems where in\ufb02ammation plays a role becauseof its anti-in\ufb02ammatory effect. Heat works best for chronic painor for injuries that are over twenty-four hours old because itincreases blood \ufb02ow (and therefore healing) in the area. Only usethe ice or heat for twenty minutes at a time so you don\u2019t freeze oroverheat the affected area and cause further injury. Ice and heatcan also be alternated for injuries over twenty-four hours old orfor chronic pain. Use the ice \ufb01rst for twenty minutes (this acts asan anti-in\ufb02ammatory) followed by a heating pad or moist heat fortwenty minutes. Y ou can use either of these as often as you like,as long as you wait at least thirty minutes after the treatmentbefore repeating the cycle.\nIn these last few chapters, you have read about a number of gen-\neral principles that apply to pain relief and pain management. InPart II, you will \ufb01nd speci\ufb01c details of when and how to applythese principles to speci\ufb01c types of pain.ELIMINATING THE CAUSES AND TRIGGERS OF YOUR PAIN\n71", "This page intentionally left blank ", "PART II\nEvaluating and Treating\nCommon T ypes of Pain\nNew research suggests that pain affects men and women differently.\nThis likely occurs in part because of hormonal differences related toestrogen and testosterone. For example, male animals injected withestrogen appear to have a lower pain threshold, while giving testos-terone to female animals increases pain tolerance. How pain is trans-mitted in our bodies also contributes to the differences in how painis felt by men and women. Both sexes have a natural ability to sup-press pain, but the mechanisms are different.\nSocietal factors may also play a role. Women are quicker to seek\nmedical help and less likely to allow pain to control their lives. Theyare also more likely to ask for help from their friends. A person\u2019s agealso plays a role in pain. One out of \ufb01ve older Americans takes apainkiller on a regular basis. Because they are prone to medications\u2019side effects, such as bleeding ulcers from nonsteroidal anti-in\ufb02ammatory drugs (NSAIDs), \ufb01nding alternative and safer remediesis especially helpful for older patients.\nIn these next few chapters, I will explain the basic types of pain\n(nerve, muscle/myofascial, arthritis, in\ufb02ammatory, and so on) and thetreatments that are most effective for eliminating them.\n73\nCopyright \u00a9 200 6 by Jacob  Teitelbaum .

As I mentioned in Chapter 1, pain serves a\ncritical function, and we would be in serious trouble if wecouldn\u2019t feel what is happening in our bodies. However, pain thatdoesn\u2019t quit is worrisome. Chronic pain can result from diseases,infections, or trauma. However, there is a different type of painthat affects the nerves and can be unbearable. The term neuropathic\npain, or nerve pain, refers to a wide range of problems that cause\ndiseases of, or injury to, the nervous system. It is a category ofpain syndromes and not a single problem. Neuropathic pain cancome from malfunction of nerves or the brain associated with ill-ness (diabetes, low thyroid), infections (shingles), pinched nerves,nutritional de\ufb01ciencies (vitamins B \u2086and B \u2081\u2082), injury (stroke,\ntumors, spinal cord injury, and multiple sclerosis), and medica-tion/treatment side effects (radiation and chemotherapy, AIDSdrugs, Flagyl). It is estimated that 50 to 80 percent of diabeticswill develop some nerve injury, with 30 to 40 percent of thesehaving painful diabetic neuropathy unless preventive measures aretaken such as nutritional support. Neuropathic pain affectsapproximately 0.6 to 1.5 percent of the U.S. population (roughlytwo million Americans) and 25 to 40 percent of cancer patients.CHAPTER4\n75\nCopyright \u00a9 200 6 by Jacob  Teitelbaum . Click here for terms of use.  ", "Types and Causes of Neuropathic (Nerve) Pain\nNeuropathies are characterized by pain that is burning, shooting\n(often to distant areas), or stabbing. It also has an \u201celectric\u201d qual-ity about it. Tingling or numbness ( paresthesias ) and increased sen-\nsitivity with normal touch being painful ( allodynia ) are also\ncommonly seen. Continual pain is often present regardless ofwhat the patient does or does not do. In some cases, pain comesin sudden attacks without any apparent trigger. Diagnosis is madepredominantly by history and physical examination, as testingoften offers little bene\ufb01t clinically unless the testing is looking fora treatable cause.\nAs with other pain problems, neuropathies are both expensive\nand poorly treated. In one study of 55,686 patients with neuro-pathic pain, health-care charges were threefold higher than theywere in the overall population ($17,355 versus $5,715 per year,respectively). Use of relatively ineffective therapies such asNSAIDs (like Motrin) and opioids was widespread, while rela-tively few received anti-epileptic drugs, tricyclic antidepressants,or any of the many other medications that are often much moreeffective in relieving neuropathic pain.\nIn the presence of nerve pain, it is especially important to look\nfor treatable causes. Lab testing should include:\n\u2022A blood count (CBC) and an in\ufb02ammation/sedimentation\nrate (ESR)\n\u2022Thyroid testing with a free T4 and TSH\n\u2022Vitamin B\n12level\n\u2022Screening for diabetes with a morning fasting blood sugar\nand a glycosylated hemoglobin (HgBA1C)\nThe medical history should be assessed for excess alcohol use,\nvitamin de\ufb01ciencies, hereditary factors, or treatment with med-ications that can cause nerve injury. A neurological examinationmay also give an indication of the cause.EVALUATING AND TREATING COMMON TYPES OF PAIN\n76", "Nerve pain is often associated with a process known as pain-\nsensitization. The nerves and brain are like wires that carry infor-mation. When they become overstimulated with chronic pain, itmay make the whole system overexcitable. In these situations nor-mal touch and other usually comfortable contact can be painful.Medications that stimulate the calming (GABA) receptors in thebrain, such as a number of antiseizure medications, can help set-tle the system and decrease pain.\nPostherpetic Neuralgia (PHN)\nPostherpetic neuralgia follows a rash called herpes zoster . Often\ncalled shingles, it is caused by the same virus that causes chickenpox. The \ufb01rst time you get chicken pox, the virus remains in yournerve endings even after the chicken pox is gone. This usuallycauses no problems. If the virus reactivates in one of the nerveendings, however, it causes a rash all along the distribution of thenerve. The rash of herpes zoster is characterized by being painfuland being in a line totally on one side of the body. If it extendspast the midline of your body, the rash is probably coming fromsomething else. If the pain persists after the rash is gone, contin-uing for weeks to years (over one year in half of elderly patients),it is called postherpetic neuralgia (PHN). The pain tends to be burn-\ning, electric, or deep and aching. PHN affects between \ufb01ve hun-dred thousand and one million Americans, most of whom areelderly. It can severely disrupt one\u2019s life, but fortunately can nowbe effectively treated in most cases.\nPainful Diabetic Neuropathy (PDN)\nPDN is the most common cause of neuropathy in the UnitedStates. Alterations in sensation are common, and the feet, whichare most often affected, may feel both numb and painful at thesame time. Many factors contribute to nerve injury in diabetes,including decreased circulation, damage from elevated sugars,accumulation of toxic by-products, and nutritional de\ufb01ciencies.There are also changes in pain receptors.FOCUSING ON NERVE PAIN\n77", "Research has shown that many people who are labeled as hav-\ning diabetic neuropathy actually experience neuropathic paincaused by vitamin B \u2086or B \u2081\u2082de\ufb01ciency. In addition, the nutrient\ninositol has been shown to improve nerve function. The nutrientlipoic acid has also been shown to be very helpful for diabeticnerve pain.\nNutritional De\ufb01ciencies\nNeuropathic pain can also be caused by de\ufb01ciencies of vitaminsB\u2081, B \u2086, B \u2081\u2082, and E and zinc. A number of studies have shown that\ndifferent kinds of nerve pain can improve by supplementationwith high-dose B vitamins. Excess vitamin B \u2086(over 500 mg a day\nfor years), however, can also cause neuropathy.\nIn patients with long-standing shingles pain, one study showed\nthat taking 1,600 units of vitamin E (use the natural form) dailybefore a meal for six months was markedly helpful in eliminatingthe pain. Another study showed that taking lower doses for lessthan six months was not effective.\nHormonal De\ufb01ciencies\nHormonal de\ufb01ciencies, especially an underactive thyroid, can alsocause neuropathic as well as muscular pain. A therapeutic trial ofthyroid hormone is reasonable for anybody who has the symptomsof low thyroid including fatigue, cold intolerance, achiness, havinglow body temperatures, or unexplained inappropriate weight gain.\nNerve Entrapments\nA pinched nerve can cause nerve pain in many places in the body.T wo of the more common ones are low back pain from sciaticaand pains in the hand and sometimes wrist from carpal tunnel syn-drome. Sciatica usually goes away without surgery by using intra-venous colchicine, and carpal tunnel syndrome usually resolvesafter six to twelve weeks with vitamin B \u2086(250 mg a day), thyroid\nhormone, and wrist splints (see Chapter 10).EVALUATING AND TREATING COMMON TYPES OF PAIN\n78", "Trigeminal Neuralgia\nAlso known as tic douloureux , trigeminal neuralgia causes excruci-\nating attacks of pain in the lips, gums, cheek, or jaw. It usuallyoccurs in the middle-aged and elderly and seldom lasts more thana few seconds or minutes. The painful attacks recur frequentlythroughout the day and night for several weeks at a time. They canbe triggered by stimulating certain areas on the face. T egretol elim-inates the pain in 75 percent of patients. Begin with 100 mg a day(taken with food), increasing slowly up to 200 mg four times a dayas needed. Other treatments listed in the next section can also behelpful. If these treatments fail, surgical options are available.\nTreating Neuropathic Pain\nNeuropathic pain occurs biochemically, making it a very \ufb02uid sys-tem that can often be quickly modi\ufb01ed, resulting in pain relief.Many different chemicals (neurotransmitters) in your body maybe involved in your pain, and therefore it is worth trying differ-ent types of medications to see which ones work best in your case.For many, treating the nutritional and thyroid de\ufb01ciencies andeliminating the muscle spasms that are compressing the nervesmay be enough to eliminate the pain. Others may need to takemedications to suppress the pain while looking for ways to elim-inate the underlying cause. The best way to tell which chemicalsare involved in your nerve pain is to simply try different medica-tions (individually and, if needed, in combination) to see whateases your pain. Basically, it is like trying on different shoes to seewhat \ufb01ts best. The good news is that we have a large assortmentof \u201cshoes\u201d that you can try on and that are likely to help you.\nIt is, of course, critical to begin by eliminating the underlying\ncauses of neuropathy and giving the nerves what they need toheal. This includes the nutritional support I\u2019ve discussed in Chap-ter 2. In addition, the involvement of free radicals in nerve exci-tation was found in 1995, supporting the use of antioxidants inFOCUSING ON NERVE PAIN\n79", "nerve pain. Since that time, the antioxidant lipoic acid (300 mg\nthree times a day) has been shown to be helpful in diabetic neu-ropathy and should be tried in other neuropathies as well. Y ouwill be amazed at how much bene\ufb01t you may get over time sim-ply from optimizing nutritional support.\nIn addition, if you are tired, are cold intolerant, experience\nachiness, have low body temperature, or have gained weight, Ithink it is reasonable to consider a therapeutic trial of natural thy-roid hormone regardless of your blood levels. It may take three tosix months for the thyroid and/or nutritional therapies to beginworking, but regardless of the cause of your neuropathy, thistreatment may result in nerve healing. It is reasonable to beginmedications along with the nutritional support so that you can getpain relief as quickly as possible. If only a small area is involved,it makes sense to begin with a Lidocaine patch. Otherwise, I pre-fer to begin with Neurontin and/or tricyclic antidepressants. Allof the recommended oral nutrients discussed in this chapter,except lipoic acid and the 1,600 unit megadose of vitamin E, arecontained in the Energy Revitalization System vitamin powderand B-complex. For carpal tunnel syndrome, add 200 mg of B\n6to\nthe powder.\nLet\u2019s look at each of the different categories of treatments that\ncan be helpful for nerve pain. Begin with the nutritional and thy-roid support, and then you can add the following medications inthe order that they\u2019re listed.\nLidocaine Patch\nThis Novocain-like patch (5 percent) is applied directly over thearea of maximum pain. It can be cut to \ufb01t the area, and up to fourpatches can be used at a time (although the package insert saysonly three). It is left on for twelve hours and then removed fortwelve hours each day, although recent reports have suggested thatthe patch can be left on up to eighteen hours and still be safe andeffective. Results will usually be seen within two weeks. BecauseEVALUATING AND TREATING COMMON TYPES OF PAIN\n80", "the effect is local, side effects are minimal. The most common side\neffect is a mild skin rash from the patch. It should not be used ifyou have an allergy to Novocain/lidocaine.\nThe patches are most likely to be helpful if the pain is local-\nized to a moderately sized area. Even in a large area, however,patches can be used on the most uncomfortable spots. The maindownside of the patches is that they are expensive. If you haveprescription insurance, however, they will usually be covered.\nNeurontin and Other Seizure Medications\nNewer antiseizure medications, and some of the older ones, canalso be very helpful for neuropathic pain. Neurontin has beenshown to be helpful for both shingles and diabetes pain. Commonside effects include sedation, dizziness, and sometimes mildswelling in the ankles when \ufb01rst starting therapy. These sideeffects can often be avoided by starting with a low dose and rais-ing the dose slowly. A common total dose for Neurontin is 600mg, three to four times a day.\nTricyclic Antidepressants\nTricyclic antidepressants include medications such as Elavil,T ofranil, nortriptyline, or doxepin. T ofranil may be more effec-tive than Elavil. Sedation, constipation, dry mouth, and weightgain are the most common side effects, although dizziness can alsooccur. Other side effects include urinary retention, sweating, andabnormal heart rhythms. As most of the bene\ufb01t occurs with the\ufb01rst 10 to 50 mg, and most of the toxicity occurs with higherdoses, if adequate relief is not attained at a low dose, beforeuncomfortable side effects occur, I then add the next treatment orswitch to another tricyclic instead of pushing the dose to higherlevels. If it gave no bene\ufb01t, I would, of course, stop the tricyclicswhen I began the next treatment. These can be very helpful fornerve pain and have the added bene\ufb01t of being inexpensive (if youbuy the generic form of the drug).FOCUSING ON NERVE PAIN\n81", "Although antidepressants can be helpful for pain, even if no\ndepression is present, they seem more likely to help nerve painwhen they also raise adrenaline (norepinephrine) and not justserotonin. For example, the medication Effexor reduced diabeticnerve pain by 75 to 100 percent in one open study of elevenpatients. I recommend use of Effexor early in your treatment ifyou have depression associated with your pain. Higher doses(225 mg a day) seem more effective for nerve pain than the lowerdoses used for depression.\nTopical Gels or Creams\nA wonderful new addition to the treatment of pain in general, andespecially nerve pain, is the use of prescription topical gels orcreams. New gels have been developed that markedly increase theabsorption of medications through the skin. By using a low doseof many different medications in the cream, one can get a pow-erful effect locally with minimal side effects. It is best to have aknowledgeable compounding pharmacist guide you and yourphysician in the prescribing of these creams and gels. (See Appen-dix B for help in \ufb01nding a compounding pharmacy.)\nFor example, studies have shown that for long-standing, per-\nsistent nerve pain (average thirty-one months) that occurs aftershingles (postherpetic neuralgia, or PHN), using a 5 percent Ket-amine gel applied two to three times daily over the painful skinareas decreased pain signi\ufb01cantly in 65 percent of cases\u2014usuallywithin days and without side effects, except for occasional mildskin irritation. Other studies have also found topical Neurontin,opioids, and capsaicin to be effective. Lidocaine patches resultedin a highly signi\ufb01cant decrease in pain, which was seen withinone week. I \ufb01nd the Lidocaine patches to be more effective thanthe Lidocaine topical gels.\nTo explore an example of how to treat with these cr eams com-\nbined with nutritional support, let\u2019s use the example of diabeticneuropathy. One must, of course, begin with proper control ofEVALUATING AND TREATING COMMON TYPES OF PAIN\n82", "the elevated blood sugar. Nutritional support with high levels of\nvitamin B \u2086, vitamin B \u2081\u2082, and inositol are important in diabetic\nnerve pain as are many other nutrients, such as vitamins C and E,magnesium, antioxidants, and bio\ufb02avonoids. In addition, lipoicacid 300 mg three times a day has been shown to be helpful fordiabetic neuropathy. A compounded gel containing Ketamine 10percent, Neurontin 6 percent, clonidine 2 percent, and nifedipineshould be added to painful areas (apply 1 gram three times a dayas needed). The nutritional support can actually make the pain goaway over time, while the cream/gel can add symptomatic relief.Other medications discussed in this chapter can then be added asneeded to assist in the neuropathic pain.\nAnother excellent cream for neuropathic pain is a combination\nof lidocaine 10 percent, amitriptyline 7 percent, Ketamine 5 per-cent, and T egretol 7 percent used two to four times a day asneeded. If results are not seen within fourteen days, speak withthe compounding pharmacist (or your physician if he or she isfamiliar with pain creams) about modifying what is in the cream.Start with having the pharmacist make up relatively small amountsof the cream until you \ufb01nd a mix that works well for you.\nAlthough it is generally not recommended that the gels be\nused under occlusion (putting plastic wrap or a patch over the gelto force it into the skin) because this may raise blood levels of themedications causing side effects, I think the bene\ufb01t of increasedeffectiveness may outweigh the risks. I feel it is reasonable to putthe Lidocaine patch over an area where you have applied the paingels once the gel has dried. If you get unacceptable side effects,remove the patch and use the patch and creams/gels separately.\nUltram (Tramadol)\nUltram is an interesting medication that works on many areas ofpain and in many different types of pain. It has been shown to beeffective for nerve pain in a placebo-controlled study after fourweeks. It blocks both norepinephrine and serotonin reuptake andFOCUSING ON NERVE PAIN\n83", "also stimulates the narcotic receptors. Main side effects include\ndizziness, nausea, constipation, sedation, and light-headedness onstanding. These are more likely to occur when the dose is raisedrapidly. Lower doses should be used with antidepressants andother medications that can raise your serotonin levels.\nBegin with a dose of 50 mg one to two times daily and\nincrease to a maximum of 100 mg four times a day. Most people\ufb01nd that 100 mg twice daily is wonderful and higher doses causeuncomfortable side effects.\nAdditional Drug Treatments for Nerve Pain\nAlthough the medications previously listed are the ones that I usemost commonly for nerve pain, there are many other treatmentsthat can also be helpful (see Chapter 13). These include T opamax,Cymbalta, Lamictal, Zana\ufb02ex, Gabitril, Keppra, Trileptal, Dilan-tin, capsaicin, narcotics, amantadine, Zonegran, and Benadryl.\nSaint-John\u2019s-Wort for Nerve Pain\nSaint-John\u2019s-wort is best known for its effectiveness in the treat-ment of depression. It has, however, also been found to be help-ful for some people in treating neuropathic pain. In one studyusing approximately 1,000 mg a day of Saint-John\u2019s-wort for \ufb01veweeks, approximately 20 percent of the subjects had a goodresponse. For treating neuropathies, I would recommend taking600 mg three times a day for six weeks. At that time you candecide whether the bene\ufb01ts justify staying on it.\nRe\ufb02ex Sympathetic Dystrophy (RSD)\nRe\ufb02ex sympathetic dystrophy (RSD) is a nasty and chronic paindisorder affecting as many as 1.5 million Americans. It oftenbegins with severe pain in one hand or foot. It is also referred toas complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS). It usually manifestsas horribly severe pain in one hand or foot but can certainly spreadelsewhere. When I \ufb01rst meet a patient, and I see that he or sheEVALUATING AND TREATING COMMON TYPES OF PAIN\n84", "immediately moves her hand or foot out of the way to be sure that\nit is not touched, I quickly inquire about symptoms suggestingRSD.\nThe Re\ufb02ex Sympathetic Dystrophy Association of America\nde\ufb01nes the disorder as a multisystem, multisymptom syndromethat usually affects one or more extremities and can affect theentire body. There are many pain patterns, but the pain is oftenvery severe and much greater than one would expect from theprecipitating injury. Any number of traumas, including accidents,fractures, surgery, or even mild injuries such as IV insertions, cantrigger RSD in one\u2019s hands or feet. Interestingly, injury of the hipcan cause foot pain, and injury in the shoulder can cause handpain. A heart attack can also trigger RSD in the hand. Pain is usu-ally burning or stinging, and the skin has exquisite sensitivity toeven the lightest touch. It is sometimes associated with swelling,color and temperature chan ges in that hand or foot, and unusual\nsweating. Muscle spasms, tremor, and/or weakness may also bepresent. Although it is classically considered to affect just oneextremity, according to one survey as many as 70 percent of peo-ple with RSD had noted spreading of pain beyond the hand orfoot to other parts of the body.\nThe most common pattern of spread is for pain to move over\nthe same extremity. It may continue to spread or move to theopposite extremity or other distant sites. Early diagnosis withprompt treatment may result in the problem being more easilyreversed.\nCombining Treatments for Effectiveness\nMany pain specialists use a combination of treatments, includingphysical therapy, medication, electrical nerve stimulation, nerveblocks, and/or emotional support with counseling. It is best toavoid surgery or further injury to the area, if at all possible, as itwill usually result in worsening of the symptoms. Casting andimmobilization can also worsen symptoms and should be avoidedas well. Unfortunately, there\u2019s no de\ufb01nitive test for the illness asFOCUSING ON NERVE PAIN\n85", "nerve pain does not show up on x-rays or standard diagnostic tests.\nBecause of this, most people with RSD have not been properlydiagnosed, resulting in further psychological trauma. The level ofpain can be anywhere from mild to devastating. Patients some-times choose to have the extremity amputated because of thepain, only to \ufb01nd that the pain still persists! In addition, it is sus-pected that people who have had RSD once are at greater risk ofdeveloping it again with future injury.\nThe good news is that in addition to new treatments, there is\nalso a simple preventive measure. In one study of 123 adults withwrist fractures, half of the patients were given 500 mg of vitaminC daily and the other half were given placebo for \ufb01fty days. RSDoccurred in 22 percent of the patients in the placebo group, butonly 7 percent of the vitamin C group.\nFor more information on RSD, visit the website of the RSD\nSyndrome Association of America at rsd.org.\nAn Exciting New Treatment Approach for RSD\nAlthough the treatments discussed for neuropathic pain can alsobe helpful in RSD, because of the severity of this illness and thefact that it often does not respond to other treatments, I am veryexcited about a new treatment approach. This involves the use ofKetamine, an anesthetic. Unfortunately, many patients experiencethe side effect of intoxication, including hallucinations, whichmay be uncomfortable. This problem can be avoided in most casesby giving the Ketamine as a topical gel. In one study of \ufb01vepatients with refractory re\ufb02ex sympathetic dystrophy, pain wastemporarily relieved by 65 to 100 percent within three minutesof applying Ketamine gel (1 to 9 mg Ketamine per kilogram ofbody weight) to the painful area without signi\ufb01cant side effects.All patients chose to continue treatment. The dose needed tomaintain the bene\ufb01t ranged from 50 to 600 mg, three to six timesdaily.\nSince this study was conducted, reports have been published\nof permanent elimination of severe RSD using an IV infusion ofEVALUATING AND TREATING COMMON TYPES OF PAIN\n86", "Ketamine continuously for six days. The IV Ketamine was started\nin one patient at 10 mg per hour and increased by 10 mg per hourevery two hours as tolerated, with the maximum infusion rate of30 mg per hour. A higher dose was not used, as the patient wishedto remain \u201cin control\u201d without being overly intoxicated from themedication. By day three her pain was decreasing, and by day \ufb01veit was gone. Cessation of the pain continued after the treatmentwas stopped. This medication holds great promise for the treat-ment of this devastating problem.\nDr. Argo, a pain specialist at the Pain Management Center at\nColumbia Rose Medical Center, Denver, has found that Paxil canbe helpful for re\ufb02ex sympathetic dystrophy where other SSRIs arenot. In another clinic, a combination of Neurontin and clonidinecreams decreased RSD pain by one-third.FOCUSING ON NERVE PAIN\n87", "This page intentionally left blank ", "When In\ufb02ammation\nLeads to Pain\nIn\ufb02ammation is your body\u2019s response to what it perceives to be an\noutside invader or irritant (for example in gout). When caused byinfections, the in\ufb02ammation can sometimes be rather obvious, asoccurs with pneumonia. Other times, it can be very subtle. Keepin mind the following key points regarding in\ufb02ammation and pain:\n\u2022Treat the underlying infections or irritants when possible.\n\u2022Often the in\ufb02ammation causes more harm than good. It is\noften worthwhile to simply decrease the in\ufb02ammation usingnatural remedies, nutrients, ultra low-dose cortisol, and anti-in\ufb02ammatories such as aspirin and Motrin familymedications.\n\u2022Sometimes the in\ufb02ammation is obvious because it causesredness, heat, and swelling.

Lupus (systemic lupus erythematosus, or SLE) is a common\nautoimmune disease that often results in signi\ufb01cant fatigue andpain. What most rheumatologists don\u2019t realize is that the second-ary \ufb01bromyalgia caused by lupus and many other rheumatologicCHAPTER5\n89\nCopyright \u00a9 200 6 by Jacob  Teitelbaum .

Flaring \ufb01bromyalgia may also be misinterpreted as a \ufb02ar-ing of lupus or other in\ufb02ammatory disease activity. In addition,both of these illnesses can be associated with marked vitamin Dde\ufb01ciencies. Vitamin D de\ufb01ciency has also been associated withmuscle pain.\nWhen one treats the associated \ufb01bromyalgia, patients often\n\ufb01nd that their lupus is actually a minimal problem. In addition,several studies have shown that taking DHEA, 200 mg a day, sig-ni\ufb01cantly improves the outcome of lupus and allows the patientto get by with a lower dose of prednisone. The main side effectsof a too-high DHEA level are darkening of facial hair and acne.If either of these occurs, lower the dose. It is unnecessary to fol-low blood levels of DHEA at this dose because this is a very highdose and you can assume the blood level will be high. Lowerdoses, however, are not as effective as 200 mg a day. As many, ifnot most, in\ufb02ammatory and/or autoimmune illnesses can cause asecondary \ufb01bromyalgia, and \ufb01bromyalgia is now treatable, it isimportant to keep this possibility in mind. If you have widespreadpain, fatigue, and insomnia, look for and treat the associated\ufb01bromyalgia!\nWhen In\ufb02ammation Is Unhealthy\nIn\ufb02ammation is part of our natural healing process. Wheneverthere is injury, our body puts out cytokines in the injured area tobring in white blood cells to knock out any infections and bringin other cells to begin the healing process. Because of this, healthyin\ufb02ammation is a very bene\ufb01cial tool that our body uses to heal.The cells come in, eliminate any infections, \ufb01x the problem, andthen dissipate. When healthy, in\ufb02ammation is almost always local-ized and short-term.\nIn\ufb02ammation can become unhealthy, however. In these situa-\ntions it is often generalized throughout the body. In addition toEVALUATING AND TREATING COMMON TYPES OF PAIN\n90", "causing pain and disability, it can also cause premature aging. As\nmentioned earlier, anytime you see the suf\ufb01x -itisat the end of the\nword, it tells you that unhealthy in\ufb02ammation is present. Excessin\ufb02ammation is very common. For example:\n\u2022Over 40 million Americans have arthritis. The in\ufb02ammation\ncan then damage the joints, causing deformity.\n\u2022Allergic rhinitis, which causes swelling of the nasal passages,\nis also common, affecting approximately 40 millionAmericans.\n\u2022Gastritis and colitis cause abdominal pain.\n\u2022Dermatitis, including psoriasis and eczema, are in\ufb02ammatory\nillnesses of the skin.\n\u2022Alzheimer\u2019s disease and heart disease have been associated\nwith increased in\ufb02ammation.\n\u2022Asthma, with its associated bronchitis, is an in\ufb02ammatory\ncondition\u2014and one that has doubled in frequency duringour lifetime. In treating allergies and asthma, we sometimesmistakenly focus on the trigger. But the trigger is not themain problem because most people don\u2019t have problemswhen they come in contact with that trigger. It is moreimportant to look at the cause of the overall reactivity ineach individual.\nThe Link Between Diet and In\ufb02ammation\nWe are now beginning to understand why we are so much moreprone to in\ufb02ammation these days than we were in the past. Cluesfor understanding this can be found by looking at how the mod-ern diet has changed over the last several thousand years.\nOur body\u2019s armies of in\ufb02ammation are often on high-alert\nwhen they don\u2019t have to be. Much of this occurs because of thehigh amounts of animal fats relative to \ufb01sh and vegetable oils in ourdiets. Land animal fats tend to contain arachadonic acid (in theomega-6 fatty acids family), which stimulates in\ufb02ammation. FishWHEN INFLAMMATION LEADS TO PAIN\n91", "oils and some vegetable oils, such as \ufb02axseed, contain what are\ncalled omega-3 fatty acids. These decrease in\ufb02ammation. Over thelast few hundred years, we have markedly decreased anti-in\ufb02ammatory omega-3 fatty acids and increased pro-in\ufb02ammatoryomega-6 fats in our diet. This often results in our bodies being onin\ufb02ammatory overdrive.\nResearch shows that prehistoric hunter-gatherers were much\nless likely to have degenerative diseases; their main problems wereinfection and trauma. They had a high-protein, high\u2013c omplex-\ncarbohydrate, and high-\ufb01ber diet. Most important, their diet washigh in omega-3 fatty acids and low in in\ufb02ammation-stimulatingomega-6 fatty acids (fats from meat, saturated and trans fats, short-ening, margarines, and grains). Their diet was also high in antiox-idants, nutrients that put out the in\ufb02ammatory \u201c\ufb01res.\u201d Foods werealso unprocessed and low in re\ufb01ned sugar.\nAs society became more farming-based, our diet included more\ngrains, and cattle were more likely to be grain fed. All this resultedin higher levels of the omega-6 pro-in\ufb02ammatory fats. Theseomega-6 fats stimulated cytokines and in\ufb02ammation. At this time,in\ufb02ammation began to increase. This problem has been seen oncebefore in recorded history in ancient Egypt. This civilization alsohad the osteoporosis and in\ufb02ammatory diseases seen today.\nOur current diet has continued to degenerate to where we are\ngetting as much as twelve to twenty times as many in\ufb02ammatoryfats in the diet as we used to! In addition, we have a massiveamount of sugar, potatoes, and white \ufb02our in our diet. This stim-ulates insulin resistance and release, further increasing the pro-duction of pro-in\ufb02ammatory hormones (arachadonic acid) fromthese omega-6 fats. At the same time, our intake of antioxidantsto put out these \ufb01res has markedly decreased.\nTreating In\ufb02ammation\nExcess in\ufb02ammation has been associated not just with anincreased tendency to pain, but at times with increases in heartEVALUATING AND TREATING COMMON TYPES OF PAIN\n92", "attacks and other diseases as well. Y ou can sometimes see this ten-\ndency to over-in\ufb02ammation in yourself when you get a paper cut.Sometimes the paper cut heals so quickly that you barely noticeit\u2019s there. At other times, the same type of cut will be red andin\ufb02amed and will continue to hurt beyond the initial few secondsof the cut.\nFor acute injury, remember the old standbys. These go by the\nacronym RICE, which stands for rest, ice, compression, and ele-vation. These are the standard treatments recommended bycoaches, trainers, and other professionals to treat muscle or jointinjuries such as sprains or strains. When combined with enzymessuch as Megazyme or Ultrazyme and homeopathic creams such asTraumeel (one of several wonderful products for traumatic injuriesthat contains arnica), acute injuries heal much more quickly.Adding another supplement called MSM can help when tissuehealing is necessary (for example with sprains or broken bones).The vitamin powder can give overall support for healing as well.\nMedical Approaches\nMedically, anti-in\ufb02ammatories like Motrin and Celebrex can beused to block conversion of the omega-6 fats to the pro-in\ufb02ammatory cytokines by blocking the enzyme cyclooxygenase(COX). Y ou can decrease your tendency to excess in\ufb02ammationby using steroids such as prednisone or the nonsteroidal anti-in\ufb02ammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Unfortunately, both of these canbe fairly toxic, and they also block your body\u2019s ability to makeanti-in\ufb02ammatory messengers. This is one reason why over16,000 Americans a year die from NSAIDs and approximately139,000 have had heart attacks or strokes from Vioxx. High-dosesteroids can be used as anti-in\ufb02ammatories, but used long term,they can be highly toxic. Other treatments include new tumornecrosis factor blocking medicines for rheumatoid arthritis thatcost thousands of dollars a year. We focus on prescription med-ications because that\u2019s where the money is\u2014so the pharmaceuti-cal industry makes sure that we learn about them!WHEN INFLAMMATION LEADS TO PAIN\n93", "Natural Alternatives That Are Safe and Effective\nIn the long run, using diet and nutrition is a much safer and more\neffective way to get your in\ufb02ammatory system into balance. Arecent study, for example, showed that taking a multivitamin canreduce in\ufb02ammation with vitamins C and B\n6seeming to play the\nlargest role. Many other natural therapies are also helpful indecreasing in\ufb02ammation.\nSubstituting olive oil for other oils can also be very helpful.\nWhen you\u2019re shopping for meat, go to Whole Foods Market, WildOats, Sprouts, or a similar store where you can get free-rangechicken and grass-fed beef. Although it is a bit more expensive, ittastes much better, may not make you put on as much weight, andwill save you a fortune on doctor bills. Olive oil is also tasty andcan be used for frying and cooking as well as a substitute for but-ter on your bread.\nIn addition, increasing \ufb01sh, nuts and seeds, berries, free-range\nchicken and grass-fed meats, spices and herbs, and green leafy veg-etables (not potatoes and grains) can be a very helpful start. Formore information on this, there is an excellent book you can read,The In\ufb02ammation Syndrome: The Complete Nutritional Program toPrevent and Reverse Heart Disease, Arthritis, Diabetes, Allergies, andAsthma by Jack Challem. In addition to this book, an excellent set\nof two cassette tapes will help you understand excess in\ufb02ammationin more detail. In\ufb02ammation and Aging (tapes 1 and 2) by Ronald\nE. Hunninghake, M.D., are available by calling 1-800-447-7276.\nDoes that mean you should only eat things that you hate? Of\ncourse not. Y ou may \ufb01nd that substituting a wide variety of nutssuch as peanuts, cashews, or walnuts for chips and sugary snacksactually tastes better. Eating more salmon and tuna is not a bigdeal if you like these. If you don\u2019t like them, don\u2019t eat them. Y oucan always add \ufb01sh oil instead. Take one-half to two tablespoonsdaily. When you feel better you may be able to drop to one tea-spoon a day.\nSubstitute stevia or saccharin for sugar. Use sugar-free choco-\nlates (Russell Stover makes a delicious line, and there are now anEVALUATING AND TREATING COMMON TYPES OF PAIN\n94", "enormous number of yummy sugar-free options for those on the\nAtkins diet). They taste just as good as foods with sugar but willnot make you sick. In addition, as a general rule of thumb, themore color ful a vegetable the healthier it is. For example, sweet\npotatoes or carrots are a lot healthier than white potatoes. Thevitamin powder will also supply extensive antioxidant support,simplifying the process dramatically.\nThe effects of treatment with diet are not subtle. In a study\ndone at the University of Washington, it was found that womenwho ate one or two servings of \ufb01sh a week were 22 percent lesslikely to have rheumatoid arthritis. Those who had more thantwo servings a week were 43 percent less likely. Those who haddeep-fried \ufb01sh (usually fried in omega-6 fats), however, weremore likely to have rheumatoid arthritis. In another study donein Scotland, sixty-four men and women with rheumatoid arthri-tis were given \ufb01sh oil. They began to feel better in three months.By one year, they had decreased NSAID medicine use by 40 per-cent. There is also evidence suggesting that \ufb01sh oil helps heal thejoints and may decrease osteoporosis as well.\nUnlike prescription medications, which can result in quick\nresults (but some such as steroids and NSAIDs cause long-termtoxicity), natural and dietary therapies take longer to see the fulleffect. They are more likely, however, to build up and heal yoursystem. I \ufb01nd that bene\ufb01ts usually start to be seen by six to twelveweeks and continue to build over years as the person gets health-ier and healthier. Because of this, I tend to use medications as aninitial \u201cBand-Aid,\u201d while the natural therapies heal the underly-ing problem over time.\nIn addition to using \ufb01sh oil, it can be very helpful to use the\nEnd Pain formula, which contains willow bark, boswellia, andcherry. These natural elements can wonderfully decrease bothpain and in\ufb02ammation (see Chapter 11).\nJust remember that if you have excess in\ufb02ammation, your body\ncan often repair the damage over time. This means decreasingsugar and simple carbohydrates (keep chocolate, but make it sugarWHEN INFLAMMATION LEADS TO PAIN\n95", "free), increasing protein and healthy oils (\ufb01sh, olive, nuts), and\ngetting optimal nutritional support (such as the vitamin powder).Y our dietary changes can actually be simple (similar to the Atkinsdiet but using healthy fats) and will leave you younger-looking,thinner, healthier, and feeling great!\nTreating Arthritis: In\ufb02ammation of the Joints\nAs we just discussed, in\ufb02ammation is a common cause of pain andmany other medical problems that we experience in Western soci-ety. For example, anything that ends in the suf\ufb01x -itismeans that\nthe problem is in\ufb02ammatory. This includes things like arthritis,tendonitis, bursitis, spondylitis, appendicitis, and so on. Manyin\ufb02ammatory problems cause a secondary \ufb01bromyalgia, whichmay be causing most of the symptoms. If you have widespreadpain, fatigue, and insomnia, look for and treat the associated\ufb01bromyalgia (see Chapter 6). Joint pain can also come from themuscles, tendons, and ligaments around the joint, even if x-raysare abnormal.\nOne type of joint pain, known as arthritis, comes in many\nforms. The most common type is osteoarthritis, known as \u201cwearand tear arthritis.\u201d The joints mainly affected by osteoarthritis arethe \ufb01nger, knee, and hip joints. This section will help you get ahandle on in\ufb02ammatory pain and other types of arthritic pain.\nA more severe form of arthritis is rheumatoid arthritis, which\nis in\ufb02ammatory and results in hot, swollen joints. It is an autoim-mune disorder that causes the body\u2019s immune system to attack thejoints. I suspect that infections are common triggers for thisattack. The American College of Rheumatology has de\ufb01ned thefollowing criteria for rheumatoid arthritis:\n\u2022Morning stiffness lasting more than one hour\n\u2022Arthritis and soft-tissue swelling in more than three of the\nfourteen joints or joint groups\n\u2022Arthritis of hand jointsEVALUATING AND TREATING COMMON TYPES OF PAIN\n96", "\u2022Symmetric arthritis\n\u2022Subcutaneous nodules\n\u2022Rheumatoid factor at a level above the 95th percentile\n\u2022Radiological changes suggestive of joint erosion\nAt least four of these criteria need to be met, although patients are\nsometimes treated despite not meeting these criteria. The child-hood form of this disease is called juvenile rheumatoid arthritis.Other types of arthritis include psoriatic arthritis, gouty arthritisand pseudo gout, systemic lupus erythematosus and other autoim-mune diseases, and hemochromatosis (excess iron).\nAs baby boomers begin reaching the age of retirement, the\nnumber of Americans developing arthritis-type disorders isexpected to soar. This increase will add to already signi\ufb01cantarthritis rates. According to the Centers for Disease Control(CDC), one out of four American adults has been diagnosed witharthritis and another 17 percent may be suffering from it withouthaving been diagnosed. In 2002, the percentage of those diag-nosed with one or more forms of arthritis (including rheumatoidarthritis and gout), lupus, or \ufb01bromyalgia ranged from a low of17.8 percent in Hawaii to a high of 35.8 percent in Alabama.Thirty-six million workdays are lost each year because of osteo-arthritis. A Centers for Disease Control arthritis expert stated thatthe number of cases of arthritis in America is huge compared tomost other diseases. Fortunately, there are many natural and pre-scription therapies that can be effective.\nHow Diet Can Help with In\ufb02ammatory Arthritis\nIn addition to using long-term antibiotic therapy with minocy-cline in rheumatoid arthritis, it is worth considering dietarychanges as well. Diet can play a major role in in\ufb02ammatory arthri-tis. A recent study tested the role of diet in sixty patients withrheumatoid arthritis. Thirty patients were given a standard Amer-ican diet and the other thirty an anti-in\ufb02ammatory diet low inmeat and high in \ufb01sh oil\u2014with supplements given to supplyWHEN INFLAMMATION LEADS TO PAIN\n97", "approximately 2 grams of omega-3 \ufb01sh oils daily\u2014for eight\nmonths. The patients on an anti-in\ufb02ammatory diet had a 28 per-cent decrease in the number of tender joints. In addition, decreas-ing in\ufb02ammation by giving borage seed oil (supplying 1.4 g ofGLA\u2014gamma linolenic acid) decreased the swollen joint scoreby 41 percent in the active group versus a 40 percent worseningin the placebo group. No patients had to withdraw because of sideeffects. Many other nutrients, including pantothenic acid, vitaminA, vitamin C, vitamin E, boron, copper, zinc, and selenium, havebeen found to be de\ufb01cient and/or helpful in the treatment ofrheumatoid arthritis. High doses of \ufb01sh oil (for example, one totwo tablespoons a day for at least three months) have been shownto be especially helpful in over six studies. As always, use \ufb01sh oilthat is mercury and lead free (see Appendix B).\nNatural Therapies for Treating Arthritis\nI prefer using natural rather than prescription therapies for osteo-arthritis. The most common prescription medications in use(NSAIDs like Motrin) kill over sixteen thousand Americansyearly and do not slow, and may actually hasten, the progressionof the arthritis. I recommend you begin with a natural treatmentprogram that will decrease in\ufb02ammation and help repair thejoints.\nThis natural treatment program has four main components:\n1. Repair\n2. Prevent damage3. Restore function4. Rule out and treat infections and food allergies\nRepair. The joint cartilage can be repaired using a combination of\nglucosamine sulfate, condroitin, and MSM. It is also critical thatyou get comprehensive nutritional support, as discussed earlier, topromote wound healing. Glucosamine, a cartilage compound thathas been shown to actually heal your joints, is as effective asEVALUATING AND TREATING COMMON TYPES OF PAIN\n98", "NSAIDs (Motrin and other anti-in\ufb02ammatory drugs). In addi-\ntion, a recent animal study showed that glucosamine and the anti-in\ufb02ammatory drugs work synergistically. This means that whenthe two are taken together, it is much more effective than simplytaking either one alone. Using glucosamine can therefore allowyou to stop the anti-in\ufb02ammatory drugs, or at least lower theneeded dose. This can improve the safety, effectiveness, and costof treatment dramatically.\nBecause of this, for tissue repair I recommend glucosamine\nsulfate, 500 mg, three times per day. Also consider MSM, 1.5 to3 grams a day for two to \ufb01ve months, and c hondroitin, although\nthese last two are less important. MSM supplies the sulfur aminoacids needed for healing in general. Although most of the researchon MSM and arthritis has not been placebo-controlled, two stud-ies were. One showed an 80 percent decrease in arthritis pain aftersix weeks using 1,500 mg in the morning and 750 mg at lunch-time. Another showed that glucosamine and MSM are synergis-tic for reducing pain and swelling in arthritic joints. One hundredand eighteen patients with mild to moderate osteoarthritis weretreated three times daily with either 500 mg of glucosamine, 500mg of MSM, a combination of both, or placebo. After twelveweeks, the researchers found that the combination treatment hada faster effect on decreasing pain and in\ufb02ammation compared toglucosamine or MSM alone.\nGlucosamine sulfate is a cartilage-building compound that has\nbeen found to be helpful in arthritis in many studies. Although itsexact mechanism of action is not yet fully understood, it is a majorcomponent of the cartilage that is damaged in arthritic joints. Glu-cosamine taken by mouth is incorporated in the molecules thatmake up this cartilage, likely contributing to the healing of arthri-tis. I recommend the sulfate form (as opposed to glucosaminehydrochloride) because the sulfate can also help with wound/jointhealing.\nUnlike aspirin/NSAIDs that do not slow down destruction of\njoints in arthritis, glucosamine has been shown to actually helpWHEN INFLAMMATION LEADS TO PAIN\n99", "stabilize, and often heal, the joints as shown on x-ray. Doses of less\nthan 1000 mg a day do not affect symptoms, and the standard doseis 500 mg three times a day. It can also be taken as 1,500 mg oncea day. It can be taken with or without food, and has no more sideeffects than placebo. C hondroitin sulfate is sometimes added to\nglucosamine or taken by itself. Its bene\ufb01ts are modest because lessthan 10 percent of it is absorbed, as opposed to 90 percent for glu-cosamine sulfate. Because of this, I rarely use chondroitin. On theother hand, certain forms (low molecular weight brands such asthe ones made by Integrative Therapeutics and Enzymatic Ther-apy) are better absorbed and are more effective (and more expen-sive). A dose of 1,200 mg a day can be helpful in slowing downarthritis and is worth trying if you do not get adequate relief withthe other treatments. It can be taken all at once or 400 mg threetimes a day with equal effectiveness.\nOverall nutritional support is also critical. For example, low\nconcentrations and low intake of vitamin D seem to be associatedwith an increased risk of progression of osteoarthritis of the knee.In addition, SAM-e can be helpful. This nutrient is produced frommethionine (an amino acid) in combination with multiple nutri-ents, including B vitamins, folate, and inositol. It was initiallytested and found to be effective in treating depression. Research-ers also noted that it improved patients\u2019 arthritis as effectively asanti-in\ufb02ammatory medications (NSAIDs). A number of studieswere done, including one that gave 600 mg a day for two weeksfollowed by 400 mg daily for two years. Pain and stiffnessdecreased within one week, and the improvement continuedthroughout the two-year trial. A study that reviewed seven otherstudies was inconclusive. A major problem with SAM-e productsis that they are not stable and break down easily, with many prod-ucts not really delivering what they claim. In addition, it is quiteexpensive. A better alternative is to take the nutrients your bodyneeds to make SAM-e. Combining the nutrients found in the vita-\nmin powder and B complex resulted in increased bl ood levels of\nSAM-e similar to those found in people taking 400 to 800 mg ofSAM-e daily.EVALUATING AND TREATING COMMON TYPES OF PAIN\n100", "These are only a few of many examples of the importance of\noverall nutritional support in treating arthritis. Dozens of otherimportant nutrients can help arthritis, including niacin, pan-tothenic acid, B complex, vitamin C, vitamin E, boron, selen ium,\nand zinc. As you can tell, it is important to get optimal nutritionalsupport. The vitamin powder makes this easy to do.\nPrevent Damage. I recommend a mix of several natural remedies,\nmany of which can be found in combination. The formulationthat I like the most combines boswellia, willow bark, and cherry.These are combined in an excellent new product called End Pain(see Appendix B). Using these three together can powerfullydecrease many kinds of pain while preventing damaging in\ufb02am-mation. Take two to four tablets three times a day until your painsubsides (approximately two to six weeks), and then you can oftenlower the dose to one tablet two to three times a day, or as needed.Curcumin can also be a healthful anti-in\ufb02ammatory but requiresthe addition of piperine from black pepper for the curcumin to beadequately absorbed. I do not generally recommend that you usethese if you take any prescriptions, however, because piperine maypotentially also increase the absorption of other medications,causing them to reach toxic levels. Fish oil, one-half to one table-spoon daily, also has strong anti-in\ufb02ammatory properties.\nRestore Function. Restore function with stretching, exercise, and\nheat. Exercise at least twenty minutes a day. Swimming, walking,and yoga are good choices. Use a heating pad or moist heat for upto twenty minutes at a time to give relief.\nDiet, exercise, and lifestyle can be important in the treatment\nand prevention of osteoarthritis. For example, losing elevenpounds will reduce a woman\u2019s risk of developing arthritis of theknee by 50 percent over a ten-year period. Adding exercise mayfurther decrease arthritis pain.\nRule Out and Treat Infections and Food Allergies. Food allergies\ncan aggravate arthritis. The best approach I have found for theWHEN INFLAMMATION LEADS TO PAIN\n101", "elimination of food and other sensitivities or allergies is a tech-\nnique called NAET. This technique combines acupressure withapplied kinesiology in a special way and is powerfully effective. Itcan eliminate one allergy per twenty-minute treatment. It got myattention when it knocked out my lifelong hay fever in a singletwenty-minute visit. (See the website naet.com.) I recommendthat you read Dr. Devi Nambudripad\u2019s book on pain and NAETfor more information.\nIf you also have osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis, I rec-\nommend using a spin-off of this technique called JMT (see jmt-jafmeltechnique.com for more information). For rheumatoid\narthritis, I also use long-term antibiotics (minocycline) because Ifeel this is an infectious disease in many cases, and research hasshown antibiotics to be effective.\nAnother food sensitivity issue to consider is that a small per-\ncentage of people with arthritis suffer aggravation of their arthri-tis from foods in the nightshade family. These include tomatoes,potatoes, eggplant, peppers, paprika, cayenne, and tobacco. I rarelyneed to have people consider this, but it is worth considering ifarthritis pain persists despite other treatments. Eliminate the abovefoods from your diet for one month. If you do not experiencerelief, reintroduce these foods to see if they affect your symptoms.Also avoid the arti\ufb01cial sweetener aspartame (NutraSweet).\nIn addition to these four treatment areas, although it may seem\nsilly, copper bracelets have actually been shown in a blindedcrossover study to be helpful in relieving arthritis, and I have alsoseen patients get better using them.\nAdditional Natural Therapies. As noted earlier, I recommend that\nyou begin with the End Pain formula and glucosamine/MSM/chondroitin. Y ou may also want to try another pop ular home\nremedy made with pectin and grape juice, Purple Pectin for Pain.(See directions for use under \u201cAn Easy-to-Make Home Remedy\u201din Chapter 11.)\nAlthough I prefer nutritional and herbal therapies, many\nhomeopathic treatments can also be helpful for arthritis\u2014espe-EVALUATING AND TREATING COMMON TYPES OF PAIN\n102", "cially if given by a well-trained homeopath. The concept of\nhomeopathy is that an extraordinarily diluted amount of a sub-stance does the opposite of a high dosage of the same substancewhen prepared properly. There have been a number of studiesshowing that this approach can be very helpful.\nPrescription Therapies\nPrescription therapies include NSAIDs such as Motrin, COX 2inhibitors (such as Celebrex), and Ultram. Because you and yourphysician are probably well aware of these, and they are discussedin Chapter 13, we will not go into more depth about them. Arecent study also showed that the Lidoderm patches were helpfulin decreasing pain by approximately 30 percent in two weeks,with many patients experiencing over a 50 percent drop in pain.Except for headache and an occasional skin rash where the patchwas applied, treatment was well tolerated.\nAlthough I have been using natural cortisol (Cortef\u2014by pre-\nscription) in doses of up to 20 mg daily for decades, some recentlytouted techniques adapt the protocol to use low-dose pulse thera-pies. The main concern with cortisol is that too high a dose can betoxic, and it also suppresses the adrenal glands. Doses of up to20 mg daily (approximately equal to 4 to 5 mg of prednisone butsafer) have been shown to be safe even when used for extendedperiods. If the arthritis persists despite natural therapies, it is worthtrying to give the Cortef in seven- to nine-day cycles as follows:\n\u2022On days one and two, give 20 mg twice a day.\n\u2022On days three and four, give 10 mg twice a day.\n\u2022On day \ufb01ve, give 5 mg twice a day.\n\u2022Take no Cortef for the next two to four days.\nKeep repeating the cycles, looking for bene\ufb01t to occur within\nthree months. At that time, you can try lowering the dose. Ifin\ufb02ammatory arthritis is present (and in severe cases even if it isnot), consider minocycline (an antibiotic), 100 mg twice a daylong term as discussed earlier.WHEN INFLAMMATION LEADS TO PAIN\n103", "This page intentionally left blank ", "Focusing on Muscle \nand Bone Pain\nWhile pain from \ufb01bromyalgia, myofascial pain syndrome, osteo-\npororis, and cancer may seem quite different, they do share com-mon treatment options. Focusing on one or all of four key areas ofgeneral pain management can be crucial to treating these pain syn-dromes that occur in the muscles and bones. For example, in\ufb01bromyalgia and myofascial pain, my double-blind, placebo-controlled study showed a 91 percent improvement rate whenthese four areas (getting seven to eight hours of sleep, taking nutri-tional supplementation, treating hormonal de\ufb01ciencies, and treat-ing infections) were addressed. (The full text of the study can alsobe seen on my website at vitality101.com.) For both treating andpreventing osteoporosis and bone loss, incorporating the rightnutrients and hormonal support is essential. Another thing to con-sider is that in addition to causing pain, cancer that has spread tobone can also make the bones weak and susceptible to fracture.Because of this, treatments that improve bone density (and preventosteoporosis) may decrease bone pain from cancer as well. In addi-tion, cancer often triggers muscle/myofascial pain, and using thetreatments for muscle pain can result in more comfort, the patientneeding less pain medicine, and, therefore, fewer side effects.CHAPTER6\n105\nCopyright \u00a9 200 6 by Jacob  Teitelbaum . Click here for terms of use.  ", "Myofascial and Fibromyalgia Pain\nFibromyalgia (FMS) and myofascial pain syndrome (MPS) occur\nwhen your muscles get stuck in the shortened position. In\ufb01bromyalgia, this also results in reversible changes in how yourbrain processes pain. In addition, \ufb01bromyalgia patients have sup-pression of a major control center in the brain called the hypo-thalamus. This is basically like blowing a fuse in your brain. As Imentioned earlier, the good news is that our research has shownthat 91 percent of patients can turn the hypothalamic \u201ccircuitbreaker\u201d back on by treating four key areas. Doing this can makeboth \ufb01bromyalgia and myofascial pain go away.\nThe four areas are discussed at length earlier in this book in\nChapters 2 and 3. (For an in-depth look at how to eliminate\ufb01bromyalgia and myofascial pain, I invite you to read my best-selling book From Fatigued to Fantastic! )\nThe Importance of Sleep When Treating FMS and MPS\nMost patients with these illnesses \ufb01nd that they are unable to get\nseven to eight hours of deep sleep a night without taking med-ications. In part, this occurs because hypothalamic function is crit-ical to deep sleep. For patients to get well, it is critical that theytake enough of the correct sleep medications to get eight to ninehours of sleep at night! These medications include Ambien,Desyrel, Klonopin, Xanax, Soma, and if you don\u2019t have restless legsyndrome, Flexeril and/or Elavil. In addition, natural remedies canhelp sleep. An excellent natural compound is the RevitalizingSleep Formula. In the \ufb01rst six months of treatment, it is notuncommon to require six to eight different products simultane-ously to get eight hours of sleep at night. After six to eighteenmonths of feeling well, most people can come off most sleep (andother) medications. (See Chapters 11 and 13 for more informa-tion on natural and prescription sleep aids.)\nI\u2019m starting to believe that, to offer a margin of safety during\nperiods of stress, it may be wise to stay on one-half to one tabletof a sleep medication or herbal for the rest of your life. Y our doc-EVALUATING AND TREATING COMMON TYPES OF PAIN\n106", "tor may initially be uncomfortable with this. Nonetheless, my\nexperience with more than two thousand patients and tworesearch studies has found this approach to be safe and critical topeople getting well. When one recognizes that \ufb01bromyalgia andits disabling cousin chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS/FMS) arehypothalamic sleep disorders\u2014not poor sleep hygiene\u2014thisapproach makes sense. Otherwise, it is as if your doctor wouldimmediately try to stop blood pressure or diabetes medicinesevery time the patient was doing better!\nNutritional Supplementation for FMS and MPS\nNutritional de\ufb01ciencies are widespread in \ufb01bromyalgia. I recom-mend taking the vitamin powder long term. I also recommendadding D-Ribose (Corvalen) 5 grams two to three times a day;NAC, 500 to 650 mg; coenzyme Q10 (use the Vitaline form),200 mg; and acetyl l-carnitine, 1,000 mg a day for three to fourmonths if you have \ufb01bromyalgia. These are all readily available.\nFMS, MPS, and Hormonal De\ufb01ciencies\nThe hypothalamus is the main control center for most of theglands in the body. Most of the normal ranges for blood tests werenot developed in the context of hypothalamic suppression.Because of this, and for a number of other reasons, it is usuallynecessary, albeit controversial, to treat with thyroid, adrenal (verylow dose Cortef, DHEA), and ovarian and testicular hormonesdespite normal blood tests. These hormones have been found tobe reasonably safe when used in low doses.\nFMS, MPS, and Unusual Infections\nMany studies have shown immune system dysfunction in\ufb01bromyalgia/CFS. Although there are many causes of this, I sus-pect that poor sleep is a major contributor. The immune dysfunc-tion can result in many unusual infections. These include viralinfections (HHV-6, CMV , and EBV), parasites and other bowelinfections, infections sensitive to long-term treatment with theFOCUSING ON MUSCLE AND BONE PAIN\n107", "antibiotics Cipro and Doxycycline (mycoplasma, chlamydia,\nLyme, and others), and fungal infections. Although controversial,both my study and another recent placebo-controlled study foundtreating with an antifungal to be very helpful with the symptomsseen in these syndromes. Avoiding sweets (stevia is OK) and tak-ing Acidophilus Pearls (a healthy milk bacteria), two pearls twicea day for \ufb01ve months, can be helpful. I often also add prescriptionantifungals as well.\nOther Helpful Fibromyalgia Treatments\nWhile treating the underlying causes of muscle pain that we dis-cussed previously, it is also helpful to have other treatments tokeep you comfortable. NSAIDs like Motrin are minimally effec-tive, only helping about 10 percent of \ufb01bromyalgia patients. Inter-estingly, Celebrex is more likely to be helpful\u2014despite havingsimilar mechanisms of action. Safety concerns have been raisedabout this family of medications as well, however. Other medica-tions that are very helpful include Ultram, Skelaxin, Neurontin,and Baclofen. Zana\ufb02ex has also been helpful in many patients, andmost only need a 4 mg tablet at bedtime. Another helpful nondrug\npain treatment that is currently being studied is Flexyx. This ther-apy is a brainwave biofeedback and treatment system. (See \ufb02exyx.com for more information.)\nTreating Osteoporosis and Bone Pain\nOsteoporosis, or decreased bone density/strength, can worsenwith age, inactivity, and hormonal de\ufb01ciencies (estrogen, testos-terone, and DHEA). Currently, the rate of osteoporosis amongolder women is estimated to be about 29 percent, yet only 13 per-cent of older women have been diagnosed with the disease.Osteoporosis can be easily diagnosed by performing a test calleda DEXA scan. Fortunately, many treatments can be effective atrestoring bone strength and eliminating osteoporosis pain.\nAlthough using calcium to increase bone density has received\nmost of the media attention, it is actually a rather small playerEVALUATING AND TREATING COMMON TYPES OF PAIN\n108", "when it comes to improving bone strength. In addition to weight-\nbearing exercise and natural estrogen, many other nutrients andtreatments can dramatically improve bone density and decreasebone pain. Sadly, except for calcium, most doctors only hear aboutexpensive prescriptions such as Fosamax and calcitonin (200 unitstwice a day\u2014used only in severe cases). Although these can behelpful, I would certainly start \ufb01rst by adding the nutrients thatyour body needs to make strong bones.\nWhen You Already Have Osteoporosis\nIf you already have osteoporosis, I would recommend Fosamax ora related medication in addition to the other treatments men-tioned in this section. The usual dose is 70 mg once a week on anempty stomach taken with a full glass of water. It is best to take itimmediately on waking and then stay upright for thirty minutesso gravity helps it get past the stomach quickly (it can irritate thestomach). If you are on the 35 mg a week prevention dose, youshould be aware that the 35 and 70 mg tablets cost exactly thesame amount; you can save half the cost by buying 70 mg tabletsand breaking them in two. The same price for both low- andhigh-dose tablets is commonly seen with many medications.\nAdditional Nutrients for Prevention and Treatment\nThere are many other nutrients that are critical for bone produc-tion. These include magnesium, boron, folic acid, copper, man-ganese, zinc, and vitamins B \u2086, B \u2081\u2082, D, and C. All of these are\npresent in the Energy Revitalization System vitamin powder (pre-viously discussed and included in Appendix B). In addition I rec-ommend adding the following important nutrients.\nCalcium. Take 1,000 to 1,500 mg of calcium daily. Be sure you get\na form of calcium that dissolves in your stomach. Unfortunately,most calcium tablets are chalk (calcium carbonate) and do not dis-solve. Because of this, they go in your mouth and out the otherend, doing no good along the way. If you get one that is a chew-able, powder, or liquid, this is not a problem. If you get a tablet,FOCUSING ON MUSCLE AND BONE PAIN\n109", "put it in some vinegar for an hour and see if it dissolves. If it does\nnot, it will not dissolve in your stomach either, and I recommendthat brand not be used.\nIf you are taking thyroid hormone supplements, do not take\nthe calcium within two to four hours of the thyroid hormone oryou will not absorb the thyroid hormone. In addition, make surethat your free T4 thyroid blood test (not the TSH test) is notabove the upper limit of normal because too high a thyroid dosecan cause osteoporosis. Y ou may choose to take your calcium atmeals and bedtime (500 mg at lunch, dinner, and bedtime)because it is better absorbed with food, and calcium taken at nightcan help you to sleep.\nStrontium. This mineral is highly effective at improving bone\ndensity. I am not speaking about strontium-90, the very danger-ous radioactive compound released during nuclear testing. Thestrontium available in health food stores and at vitality101.com isnonradioactive and very safe\u2014even in high doses. Studies usingstrontium in the treatment of 353 osteoporosis patients showed adramatic 15 percent increase in lumbar spine bone mineral den-sity (BMD) over two years in patients using 680 mg of strontium(2,000 mg of strontium ranelate) a day. They then repeated theplacebo-controlled study with 1,649 osteoporotic women. Newfractures decreased by 49 percent in the \ufb01rst year of treatment,and bone mineral density in the lumbar spine increased by anaverage of 14.4 percent after three years. There was an 8.3 per-cent increase in hip bone density as well. Overall, strontiumappears to be approximately 150 percent as effective as Fosamax.Other forms of strontium have shown similar bene\ufb01ts, and680 mg of elemental strontium daily appears to be a good dose.Strontium gluconate is better absorbed than strontium carbonate.\nIf possible, take the strontium on an empty stomach and at a\ndifferent time of day than the calcium, as calcium can blockstrontium\u2019s absorption. Early data also suggest that the strontiummay also be helpful in the treatment of osteoarthritis. Although itEVALUATING AND TREATING COMMON TYPES OF PAIN\n110", "took three to thirty-six months of therapy, taking strontium was\nassociated with a marked reduction in bone pain in osteoporosispatients. After three years, drop the dose of strontium to 340 mga day or take it as needed.\nFish Oil. Fish oil also may decrease osteoporosis. Y ou can either\nincrease your intake of salmon and tuna or take one to two tea-spoons of \ufb01sh oil a day. (Sources of \ufb01sh oil are listed in Appen-dix B.)\nHormonal Support for Osteoporosis\nMake sure that your DHEA and testosterone levels are optimizedsince these hormones also can improve bone density considerably.These are discussed in Chapter 2 in the section on hormonal de\ufb01-ciencies. Even very low dose transdermal (by patch) estrogenreplacement therapy improves bone density in menopausal women.\nEasing Cancer Pain and Discomfort\nIt is unacceptable for cancer patients to be in pain, and the treat-ments discussed in this book can be very helpful in eliminatingcancer pain. Most cancer pain comes from muscles, bones, ornerves. Treat these pains as discussed in earlier chapters. In addi-tion, nutritional de\ufb01ciencies are rampant in cancer patients andcan contribute markedly to the pain and disability. I strongly rec-ommend that most cancer patients take the vitamin powder (dis-cussed in Appendix B; lower the dose if diarrhea is present).\nAs an aside, there are many treatments that can help cancer that\nyour oncologist may not be aware of. I recommend that anypatient with a signi\ufb01cant cancer order a search of medical studiesdone on their speci\ufb01c type and stage of cancer from HealthResources, as they do a spectacular job. (Call Jan Guthrie at 800-949-0090 for more information.) This report routinely turns upvaluable treatment options that most doctors are not aware of. Ihave seen \u201cincurable\u201d cancers go away when the patient combinesFOCUSING ON MUSCLE AND BONE PAIN\n111", "the best of the standard and complementary therapies that are\nfound in the printout\u2019s studies. As an example, my research asso-ciate has now been cancer-free for over \ufb01ve years despite havinghad an ovarian cancer metastasize to her neck!\nIn addition, here are a few thoughts for easing nausea, a com-\nmon discomfort of cancer treatment. For uncontrollable nausea,use ABHR cream applied to an area of soft skin, such as the wrist.This prescription cream contains lorazepam, Benadryl, Haldol,and metoclopramide and can be made by a compounding phar-macist (who can also guide you in its proper use). Nausea oftensettles within \ufb01fteen to thirty minutes after applying the medica-tion. The cream can be reapplied every six hours as needed.Promethazine 25 mg per 0.5 cc of cream is also helpful for nausea.\nHow Bone, Muscle, and Nerve Pain Treatment Can Help\nwith Cancer Pain\nAs I mentioned at the beginning of the chapter, cancer that has\nspread to the bones can make them susceptible to fracture. In onestudy of patients with bone metastases from breast or prostatecancer, strontium gluconate (the healthy form\u2014not the radioac-tive one), 274 mg daily, increased bone regrowth in areas oftumor and often resulted in patients feeling better and gainingweight. I would use the 680 mg a day dose of strontiumgluconate.\nIn addition, a study by Dr. Neoh Choo Aun, a wonderful\nacupuncturist and friend in Taiwan, showed that using acupunc-ture to treat the trigger points (used to treat muscle pain) in can-cer patients was very bene\ufb01cial.\nIn another study of twelve patients with very severe neuro-\npathic pain due to the cancer pushing on major nerve centers, IVmagnesium was given. Half the patients received 500 mg and theother half 1,000 mg given over ten minutes. Aside from produc-ing a mild feeling of warmth at the time of the injection, the IVwas well tolerated. T en of the twelve patients experienced signif-icant relief that lasted approximately four hours. I would give 2EVALUATING AND TREATING COMMON TYPES OF PAIN\n112", "grams of magnesium over thirty to sixty minutes. Most patients\nwith neuropathic pain will not need this, although it can easily begiven if they have an IV in place, if they simply use the medica-tions we discuss in Chapter 4 on neuropathies.\nThe rest of the chapters in this section focus on pain based in spe-\nci\ufb01c locations in the body, such as headaches and back, chest,abdominal, and pelvic pains.FOCUSING ON MUSCLE AND BONE PAIN\n113", "This page intentionally left blank ", "It\u2019s Not All in Your Head:\nTreating Headaches \nand Facial Pain\nHeadaches are a major source of chronic pain. Although most\npeople get an occasional headache, as many as 45 million Ameri-cans get them on a regular basis. Headache-related lost work timeand medical expenses cost $50 billion per year in the United Statesalone. Over $4 billion a year is spent on over-the-counter head-ache relievers. Headaches are problematic in about 10 to 18 per-cent of the general population, and 10 percent of patientsidenti\ufb01ed headache as the reason for their doctor visits. This chap-ter provides the effective prescription and natural remedies thatcan help you eliminate both mild and severe chronic headaches.\nFinding Relief from Tension Headaches\nT ension headaches account for about three-quarters of all head-aches. They cause moderate pain on both sides of, and across, theforehead, tend to both start and fade away gradually, and are theresult of muscle tightness coming from the sternocleidomastoid(SCM) muscles in the neck. These muscles begin behind the bot-\n115CHAPTER7\nCopyright \u00a9 200 6 by Jacob  Teitelbaum . Click here for terms of use.  ", "tom of the ear and come around the neck to the top of the collar\nbone (clavicle). They are the muscles that turn your head fromside to side. With tension headaches you can often \ufb01nd a tenderknot right in the middle of the muscle. This knot, called a trigger\npoint, refers pain and tenderness to the sides of your forehead (the\ntemple area) and then sends the pain across your forehead.Although putting a hot compress or one of the pain creams on thetemples and across the forehead may help temporarily, they aremore effective when placed over the tender knots in the muscleson both sides of the neck.\nOccasionally, tension headaches are felt at the base of the skull,\non the top of the head, and/or behind the eyes. For these headaches,the pain is often coming from the muscles where they attach to thebase of the skull at the top of the back of your neck. If you push onthose muscles (called the suboccipital muscles) where they attach atthe base of the skull during a headache, they will be very tender,and pressure on them can make the headache better or worse.When the pain is reproduced by pushing on the area, you knowthat these muscles are part of the source of that headache. If this isthe case, use heat and the pain creams over those tender areas.\nBecause tension headaches are muscular, the treatments (dis-\ncussed previously in Chapter 6 on myofascial and \ufb01bromyalgiapain) that cause your muscles to relax will often eliminate therecurrence of these headaches. These are nutritional support, hor-monal support, getting at least eight hours of sleep at night, andtreating underlying infections. Paying attention to structural fac-tors (discussed in Chapter 3) can also help.\nNatural and Prescription Remedies\nHerbal remedies such as the End Pain formula (see Appendix B),which contains willow bark, boswellia, and cherry, can be veryhelpful for acute attacks as can natural and prescription pain gels(discussed in Chapters 11 and 13). Although the End Pain direc-tions say to take one or two tablets, for acute pains three or fourEVALUATING AND TREATING COMMON TYPES OF PAIN\n116", "tablets at a time can be more helpful. Using two to four capsules of\nthe Revitalizing Sleep Formula with the End Pain formula (or byitself ) can also be very effective, as these herbs are also muscle relax-ants (see Chapter 11). A physical therapy technique called stretchand spray (in which the muscles are stretched while using a coolantspray to block pain), which approximately 10 percent of physicaltherapists are familiar with, is also an excellent and pain-free wayto release your muscles and eliminate a tension headache. When theunderlying metabolic and structural factors have been treated,stretch and spray may result in permanent relief of the pain.\nIn addition, there are, of course, the old standbys of chiro-\npractic and bodywork as well as Tylenol and Motrin/Advil. Othermedications that can be quite helpful include Midrin and Ultram.I would begin with the natural therapies \ufb01rst, however, as I thinkthese are both more effective and much safer.\nPreventing Tension Headaches\nWhile you are treating the underlying causes of your muscle pain,many medications can also be used to prevent chronic tensionheadaches. Antidepressants can help headache and other pains aswell as depression. In one study comparing Elavil 25 mg at bed-time with Remeron 30 mg at bedtime, both groups had fewerheadaches but the Remeron group had fewer side effects. Both ofthese medications are likely to be more effective for tension head-aches than Paxil 40 mg daily, which had only a mild effect.\nGetting Rid of Migraines\nMigraine headaches can be very severe and often leave peoplecrippled for days. They may af\ufb02ict as many as 28 million Ameri-cans. Migraines are often preceded by an aura, which may consistof visual disturbances such as \ufb02ashing lights. The headaches areoften associated with nausea, sweats, dizziness, and slurred speech.Light and sound sensitivity can be severe.IT\u2019S NOT ALL IN YOUR HEAD: TREATING HEADACHES AND FACIAL PAIN\n117", "There is still marked debate over the cause of migraines. For\ndecades, researchers thought that migraines occurred because ofexcessive contraction and expansion of the blood vessels in thebrain. Others thought this blood vessel problem occurred becauseof inadequate serotonin, the neurotransmitter that controls sleepand mood, which also plays a role in how blood vessels expand.Low serotonin also ampli\ufb01es pain by increasing the pain neuro-transmitter called substance P . Muscle spasm and nutritionalimbalances and de\ufb01ciencies can also contribute to migraines, ascan food sensitivities. Most likely, migraines are a common end-point for many different underlying problems.\nEffective migraine treatment is important. Not only are\nmigraines horribly painful for many people, but they are expen-sive as well. The average amount of work missed by those withmigraines is 19.6 days a year, costing e mployers three thousand\ndollars per year per e mployee. It is also under-treat ed, with 31\npercent of migraine patients never having sought treatment.\nMigraine-Busting Medications\nIn the United States, medications in the Imitrex family stillremain the \ufb01rst choice for treating migraines. This new family ofmedications, called triptans, has dramatically increased our abil-ity to treat migraine headaches effectively. Imitrex comes in 25,50, and 100 mg tablets, and up to 100 mg may be taken at a time.If pain persists at two hours, another dose of up to 100 mg can betaken. In addition, it is also available by nasal spray, using a doseof up to 20 mg initially, followed by one more spray of up to20 mg two hours later if needed. Another alternative is a 6 mgsubcutaneous injection, which can also be repeated one hour laterif needed. It is reasonable to try these different forms to see whatworks best for your migraines.\nImitrex has been found to be effective in eliminating an acute\nmigraine attack in 34 to 70 percent of patients within two hours.Unfortunately, at least 30 to 40 percent of patients remainedunsuccessfully treated.EVALUATING AND TREATING COMMON TYPES OF PAIN\n118", "Y ou may also want to try a newer cousin called Amerge. Use\n2.5 mg initially. This dose may be repeated four hours later ifneeded. Y our physician may also use other related medicationssuch as Zomig or Relpax. Axert (almotriptan 6.5 to 12.5 mg,which can be repeated in two hours) is similar in effectiveness toImitrex but less expensive.\nOther treatments may be effective for acute migraines when\nImitrex is not. Aspirin-family medications do not work well inmigraines because the absorption of aspirin is delayed during themigraine attack. T o combat this problem, medications that enhanceabsorption can be added to the aspirin and/or it can be given bysuppository. For example, a combination of indomethacin (a \u201csuper-aspirin\u201d), prochlorperazine (for nausea and to enhance absorption),and caffeine in suppository form were compared with sumatriptanrectal suppositories for acute migraines. Forty-nine percent ofpatients given the indomethacin combination were pain-free at twohours on the \ufb01rst treatment as compared to 34 percent with theSumatriptan.\nAnother study using a similar approach had the same result.\nAspirin (lysine acetyl salicylates, 1,620 mg\u2014equivalent to 900 mgof aspirin) was combined with metoclopramide, 10 mg. The lat-ter medication returns the absorption of aspirin to normal duringmigraine attacks and also combats nausea and vomiting. In thetwo placebo-controlled studies, this combination was more effec-tive than 100 mg of Imitrex by mouth and was better tolerated.These combinations can be made by compounding pharmacists(see Appendix B). It is quite likely that regular aspirin, especiallyif chewed, would be as effective as the form used in the study.Metoclopramide is readily available.\nOther medications can also be helpful for acute migraines.\nMany patients get relief with Midrin, which is a mix of threemedications. Take two capsules immediately followed by one cap-sule every hour until the headache is relieved (to a maximum of\ufb01ve capsules within a twelve-hour period). It can also be helpfulfor tension headaches in a dose of two capsules up to four times aIT\u2019S NOT ALL IN YOUR HEAD: TREATING HEADACHES AND FACIAL PAIN\n119", "day, as needed. Many patients \ufb01nd this to be quite helpful, and it\nis not addictive. Fiorinal can also be effective but is addictive, andI prefer not to use this medication.\nA fascinating study can guide you as to when to use Imitrex-\nfamily medications versus when to use other therapies. At a recentAmerican Academy of Neurology meeting, Dr. Burstein of Har-vard Medical School noted that 75 percent of migraine patientsget painful sensitivity to normal touch (such as that from eye-glasses) around their eyes. This pain is created in a different partof the brain than the throbbing pain that gets worse with move-ment or coughing. The study found that if these patients useImitrex before they get the tenderness/pain around the eyes, itwill knock out the migraine 93 percent of the time. If the pain/tenderness around the eyes had already set in, Imitrex only elim-inated the migraine 13 percent of the time (although it still helpedthe throbbing). In other words, if you are one of the lucky oneswho does not get pain around the eyes, the Imitrex can knock outyour migraine at any time. If you are one of those who getspain/tenderness around the eyes, it is a race against the clock totake the Imitrex before that pain starts. This means that you needto take the Imitrex early in the attack (within the \ufb01rst \ufb01ve totwenty minutes), before the skin hypersensitivity gets established.For example, use it at the earliest warning signs like painful scalpor discomfort from wearing your glasses, shaving, or wearing ear-rings. If the pain has already fully set in before you take theImitrex, consider using one of the other acute treatments we\u2019vediscussed.\nBecause of the nausea and light/sound sensitivity, antinausea\nmedications can also be helpful. Phenergan or Compazine sup-positories are two such medications.\nNatural Remedies That Can Knock Out Migraines\nT wo natural treatments can knock out an acute migraine: butter-bur and magnesium. Y ou can take butterbur at home on yourown. This herb can both prevent and eliminate migraines. TakeEVALUATING AND TREATING COMMON TYPES OF PAIN\n120", "50 mg three times a day for one month and then 50 to 75 mg\ntwice a day to prevent migraines. Y ou can take 100 mg everythree hours to eliminate an acute migraine. Use only high-qualitybrands (see Appendix B). Many others that were tested had impu-rities and did not contain the amount of butterbur the labelclaimed (in other words, they don\u2019t work).\nThe development of standardized extracts of butterbur has led\nto a powerful new natural tool in both the prevention and treat-ment of migraine headaches. T wo randomized placebo-controlleddouble-blind studies have found it to be effective. In the \ufb01rststudy, sixty migraine patients received 50 mg of butterbur twicea day. By the twelfth week, there was a 60 percent decrease in thenumber of migraine attacks compared to the placebo group. Asecond study of 202 migraine patients, who were given 75 mg ofbutterbur twice a day, showed a 58 percent decrease at threemonths. The 100 mg a day group had a 42 percent decrease atthree months. About 20 percent of people taking the butterburnoted increased burping.\nMagnesium has also been found effective for migraines. In a\nhospital emergency room or a doctor\u2019s of\ufb01ce, 1 to 2 grams ofintravenous magnesium over \ufb01fteen to thirty minutes can effec-tively eliminate an acute migraine 86 percent of the time within\ufb01fteen minutes!\nWhen Nothing Else Works: Rescue Medications\nUnfortunately, sometimes the treatments discussed above are noteffective. Because of this, and largely because most people are notaware of all the treatment options, over eight hundred thousandAmericans per year visit hospital emergency rooms for treatmentof their migraines. This is an expensive proposition; it often runsmore than \ufb01ve hundred dollars per emergency room visit. Inaddition, the average time spent in the emergency room is fourhours. Because the person usually needs to have somebody drivehim or her, this can be multiplied by two. Therefore, it is helpfulfor people to have \u201crescue medication\u201d that they can use insteadIT\u2019S NOT ALL IN YOUR HEAD: TREATING HEADACHES AND FACIAL PAIN\n121", "of having to go to the emergency room. A number of options are\navailable to serve this purpose.\nOne such remedy is the use of fentanyl lollipops, known as\noral transmucosal fentanyl citrate (OTFC, Actiq). Fentanyl lol-lipops (Actiq) should be intermittently sucked on, not chewed orswallowed. In between being sucked on, the lollipop should beleft between the cheek and lower gum. Time the sucking so thatit takes approximately \ufb01fteen minutes for the medication to beabsorbed into your cheek. This makes it more effective. Actiqcomes in six strengths (200 to 1,600 mcg). It begins to workwithin \ufb01ve to ten minutes, with pain relief lasting approximatelythree hours. Its effectiveness is similar to 2 to 16 mg of intra-venous morphine. The most commonly used doses are 400 and800 mcg.\nBecause these medications are only approved by the FDA for\nuse in patients who are on chronic narcotics, it is reasonable (if youare not already on chronic narcotic pain medications) to take the\ufb01rst dose in a doctor\u2019s of\ufb01ce to make sure that it does not cause adangerous level of sedation. Like other narcotics, this medicationcan be highly habituating. Because of this, it should only be usedas a rescue medication when other medications have failed. Onceyou have tried the 200 and 400 mcg doses and know that they arenot too sedating, begin with a 400 mcg dose over \ufb01fteen minutes.If adequate pain relief is not achieved ten minutes later (that is,twenty-\ufb01ve minutes after beginning the \ufb01rst lollipop), use another200 or 400 mcg unit every twenty-\ufb01ve minutes until adequatepain control is achieved or you reach 1,200 mcg. The average doseneeded is 800 mcg.\nIn one study using this approach, all twenty-eight of the\npatients in the study were able to avoid having to go to the emer-gency room, with twenty-seven of the twenty-eight patientsroutinely getting signi\ufb01cant relief from pain (decreasing to a mildlevel). The medication was well tolerated with the main sideeffect being nausea in 18 percent of patients. A few patients haditching that was easily relieved by Benadryl. Side effects wereEVALUATING AND TREATING COMMON TYPES OF PAIN\n122", "much less than normally experienced with the usual rescue med-\nication, Demerol.\nPreventing Migraines\nIn addition to being able to treat acute migraines more effectively,many medications can prevent them. T ogether, these medicationsreduce the number of headache days per month by an average of50 percent. These medications include beta-blockers (Inderal),calcium channel blockers, Neurontin, Depakote, T opamax, Elavil,and doxepin. Although Inderal XL can be helpful, it may aggra-vate fatigue, asthma, or depression. Another medication that canbe helpful is Zonegran (an antiseizure medication). Begin with100 mg a day for two weeks and then increase to two tablets a day.The maximum dose is 400 mg daily, although most of the bene-\ufb01t occurs at the \ufb01rst 200 mg. Because there have been rare occur-rences of a life-threatening rash (most rashes caused by themedication are not dangerous, however), stop the medicationimmediately if you get a rash. Do not use this medication if youare allergic to sulfa drugs.\nFortunately, natural remedies are even more effective in pre-\nventing migraines. They may take up to three months to startworking, however, so the above medications can be used whileyou\u2019re waiting for the natural preventives to take effect. Magne-sium by mouth has been found to be effective for migraine pre-vention and is as effective as Elavil. Magnesium serves in anenormous number of functions in the body, including the relax-ation of muscles and arteries. Most Americans get nowhere nearthe optimum amount of magnesium in their diet, getting lessthan 250 mg a day as opposed to the 650 mg that the averageChinese diet supplies. Blood testing to check magnesium levels ishorribly unreliable and may not detect magnesium de\ufb01ciencyuntil it is severe.\nDr. Alexander Mauskop, a leading authority on natural pre-\nvention of migraine headaches and the author of What Your Doc-\ntor May Not Tell You About Migraines , published a study in 1995IT\u2019S NOT ALL IN YOUR HEAD: TREATING HEADACHES AND FACIAL PAIN\n123", "showing that intravenous magnesium could abort a migraine\nheadache. He also found that intravenous magnesium could knockout other types of headaches as well. Such powerful data spurredresearchers to discover that magnesium could also preventmigraines. In one German placebo-controlled study, patients weregiven 600 mg of magnesium or a placebo daily for twelve weeks;there was a signi\ufb01cant drop in migraine frequency in the magne-sium group. Another study shows similar effects in women withmenstrual migraines. Thus, it is a good idea for most migrainepatients to take 150 to 200 mg of magnesium in the morning(present in the vitamin powder) and again with dinner or at bed-time (less if diarrhea is a problem).\nRibo\ufb02avin (vitamin B \u2082) assists in the production of energy. In\none study, migraine patients were given ribo\ufb02avin 400 mg withbreakfast every day for at least three months. By the end of thestudy they had a 67 percent decrease in migraine attacks as wellas a decrease in attack severity. This was later repeated in aplacebo-controlled study. Note that it can take three months forthe ribo\ufb02avin to start working.\nVitamin B \u2081\u2082can also decrease migraine frequency. In one\nstudy in which patients received 1,000 micrograms a day as a nasalspray, migraine frequencies decreased by an average of 43 percentafter three months (the vitamin powder/B-c omplex contains 500\nmicrograms a day).\nFeverfew is another helpful herb for migraine prevention.\nUsing feverfew was found to be very safe and has resulted in a sig-ni\ufb01cant reduction in migraines in one-third of patients.\nButterbur is a shrub that grows in Europe, Asia, and Africa. A\nstandardized extract called Petadolex was used in two double-blind studies. By the third month, those receiving active treatmentwith 100 mg a day had 60 percent fewer migraine attacks than thecontrol group. Although 100 mg a day is effective, 75 mg twice aday with food may be the optimal dose.\nFish oil has also been found to decrease the frequency of\nmigraines. In two placebo-controlled studies of patients with fre-EVALUATING AND TREATING COMMON TYPES OF PAIN\n124", "quent severe migraines that did not respond to medication, \ufb01sh oil\nwas found to be effective. Use one to two tablespoons a day forsix weeks to see the effect. Then you can decrease it to the low-est dose that maintains the bene\ufb01t.\nOther natural compounds that may be helpful include glu-\ncosamine 1,500 to 2,000 mg a day (this compound was found tobe helpful in a small study of ten patients over four to six weeks).Coenzyme Q10, 150 to 200 mg daily, decreased the average num-ber of migraine attacks from 4.8 to 2.8 per month.\nAll this suggests that many, if not most, migraines can be pre-\nvented naturally. I would begin by taking the vitamin powder plus300 mg of vitamin B\n2in the morning, plus 200 mg of magnesium\nat night. If the cost is not prohibitive, I would add butterbur aswell. Also check for food allergies, as noted in the following sec-tion, and follow the advice for hormones in Chapter 2 if themigraines are predominately around your periods or associatedwith taking estrogen. I have seen this approach commonly elim-inate frequent and horribly severe migraine problems, but remem-ber that it may take three months to see the effect.\nEliminating Migraine Triggers\nAcupuncture is another option to consider for chronic migraineand tension headaches. It results in reduced pain, reduced fre-quency of headaches, and improved function, energy, and health.In two studies conducted in New Y ork City and London, acu-puncture was found to be cost-effective. In a randomized con-trolled study of 401 patients with chronic headaches (the majorityhaving migraines), patients received up to twelve acupuncturetreatments over a three-month period versus a control group thatreceived standard care. The acupuncture patients had 22 fewerheadache days per year, 15 percent fewer sick days, and 25 percentfewer visits to the doctor.\nFood allergies are also very important to consider. Approxi-\nmately 30 to 50 percent of migraine patients get marked improve-ment by avoiding certain foods, and most people with migrainesIT\u2019S NOT ALL IN YOUR HEAD: TREATING HEADACHES AND FACIAL PAIN\n125", "are not aware of what foods are triggering their headaches. This\nhas now been demonstrated in at least four placebo-controlledstudies. Food sensitivities are an even bigger problem in childrenwith migraines. T o determine if foods are playing a role in caus-ing your headache, it is helpful to do an elimination diet, whichrequires that you eat a very limited diet for \ufb01ve days. Eat onlypears and lamb, and drink only bottled spring or distilled water.This kind of strict elimination diet will make it easier to tell iffood allergies or sensitivities are present and triggering yourmigraines when you reintroduce foods into your diet.

T wenty-\ufb01vepercent of the patients with high blood pressure also had theirblood pressure reduce to normal. The most common reactivefoods were wheat in 78 percent of patients, oranges in 65 percent,eggs in 45 percent, tea and coffee in 40 percent each, chocolateand milk in 37 percent each, beef in 35 percent, and corn, canesugar, and yeast in 33 percent each. Some studies also suggest thatthe arti\ufb01cial sweetener aspartame (NutraSweet) can triggermigraines and other headaches, although this is controversial.\nIf you have severe and frequent migraines, it is de\ufb01nitely\nworth exploring f ood sensitivities. Y ou may \ufb01nd that instead of\navoiding foods that trigger your migraines for the rest of your life,you can eliminate the sensitivities/allergies by using a powerfullyeffective acupressure technique called NAET (see NAET.com).\nReducing Estrogen-Induced Migraines\nIn many women, migraines are triggered by a sudden drop inestrogen level. Because of this, migraines are often worse on thetwo days before or after the day the period starts. For those tak-ing estrogen replacement or the birth control pill, the headachesmay occur in the hours before the next dose of therapy is due (asthe estrogen level is dropping). In these situations, the key is toprevent the dropping estrogen level. One way to do this is to useEVALUATING AND TREATING COMMON TYPES OF PAIN\n126", "an estrogen patch for one week beginning a few days before your\nperiod is expected (for example a Climara .025 patch). For thosetaking the pill, switch to a different form of birth control if youget the headaches throughout your cycle. If you only get the head-ache for the week that you stop the pill, consider taking the pillevery day and stopping it only one week every \ufb01ve months. Forthat week, use the estrogen patch noted above. Anti-in\ufb02ammatoryaspirin-family medications like Motrin and Aleve may be helpfulin combination with Imitrex-related medications in estrogen-associated headaches.\nOther Common Severe Headaches\nA surprising number of people with chronic headaches haveunderlying medical problems that are often treatable\u2014and thatshould be treated before the problem escalates any further.\nSinus Headaches\nSinusitis is a common cause of headaches. It is usually associated\nwith pain and tenderness over the sinuses by the cheeks or abovethe eyes. Nasal congestion, often with yellow-green nasal mucus,is also common. Interestingly, I have found that most cases ofchronic sinusitis are associated with yeast overgrowth. These fun-gal infections (similar to vaginal yeast infections but occurringpredominantly in the bowels) cause an allergic-type reactionresulting in swelling of the nasal passages. This swelling blocks thesinuses, resulting in a secondary bacterial infection (when themucous turns yellow-green), which is very painful. Y ou then getantibiotics from your doctor that knock out the bacterial infec-tion but worsen the yeast/fungal infection and the nasal conges-tion. Things then get blocked up again and reinfected, and youare off to the doctor for another antibiotic (and more yeast prob-lems). This is why sinusitis usually becomes chronic.\nI have found that when you treat the yeast overgrowth by tak-\ning Di\ufb02ucan for six weeks and avoiding sugar (as discussed previ-IT\u2019S NOT ALL IN YOUR HEAD: TREATING HEADACHES AND FACIAL PAIN\n127", "ously in Chapter 3 in the section on infections), most chronic\nsinusitis will go away. Adding a colloidal silver nose spray (listedin Appendix B) is also worthwhile. It is also helpful to use a spe-cial prescription nose spray that contains antibacterials and anti-fungals. Y our doctor can order it by calling Cape Apothecary at410-757-3522 and asking for the \u201csinusitis nose spray.\u201d\nUse one to two sprays in each nostril twice a day. If it is irri-\ntating, then it is too concentrated for you, and you can simply adda small amount of salt water. Patients \ufb01nd this to be enormouslyhelpful. If fungal overgrowth is causing your chronic sinusitis, itmay also be causing spastic colon, which also often resolves whenyou treat the yeast. Unfortunately, many doctors still consider thepossibility of yeast overgrowth to be nonsense\u2014just as occurredin medicine when we \ufb01rst began to understand about bacterialinfections. Because of this, you may have to go to a holistic/com-plementary physician to get the treatment you need. (Resourcesfor \ufb01nding a holistic physician are listed in Appendix B.)\nCaffeine Withdrawal Headaches\nAlthough caffeine can sometimes decrease headache pain (and canbe found combined with aspirin in some headache products), toomuch caffeine can become problematic. Common in people whodrink too much coffee, caffeine withdrawal headaches are espe-cially frequent in the morning before people get their coffee \u201c\ufb01x\u201dand may occur approximately eighteen hours after their last cupof coffee. They often begin with a feeling of fullness in one\u2019s headand may be aggravated by exercise. Slowly decreasing your caf-feine intake by about one cup daily each week, and perhaps mix-ing decaf with regular coffee as part of your weaning process, canhelp. Other people prefer to simply go cold turkey, tough out theheadache, and be done with it.\nCluster Headaches\nThese headaches occur as a repeating series of headaches that caneach last thirty to ninety minutes and are very severe. They causeEVALUATING AND TREATING COMMON TYPES OF PAIN\n128", "excruciating, piercing pain on one side of the head (often centered\naround one eye) and are much more common in men. Many med-ications can help, including antiseizure medications like Depakote(valproic acid) 500 to 1,000 mg a day or T opamax 50 to 100 mga day. These often start to work in one to two weeks. Lithium300 mg three times a day can also prevent cluster headaches.High-dose lithium must be monitored with blood level testsbecause it can cause an underactive thyroid, tremors, and othertoxicity. The tremors and neurologic toxicity can be decreased bytaking a few teaspoons of expeller-pressed saf\ufb02ower oil each day(from your local health food store).\nTrigeminal Neuralgia\nTrigeminal neuralgia affects a large cranial nerve and is charac-terized by excruciating attacks of stabbing, shooting pain in thelips, gums, cheek, or chin that last for a few seconds to minutes.It occurs almost exclusively in the middle-aged and elderly.Trigeminal neuralgia often responds well to treatment with themedications T egretol and/or Neurontin.\nOther Headaches\nIn some headaches, there may actually be increased pressure in thebrain. Some practitioners have found that using Diamox (a diuretic)125 to 500 mg once or twice daily decreases these headaches. Car-bonated beverages will taste funny while you\u2019re on this medication.\nJaw Joint Dysfunction (TMJ/TMD)\nT emporomandibular joint dysfunction (TMJ/TMD) is a commoncause of facial pain and headaches. Although classically consideredto come from the jaw joint (the area just in front of your ears), inmany cases the pain is actually coming from tightness of the mas-seter muscles, which can pull the jaw out of alignment. The mas-seter is the very powerful muscle we use to chew our food, andI\u2019ve been told it can generate 1,000 pounds of pressure per squareinch. TMJ can occur when this muscle goes into spasm/shorten-IT\u2019S NOT ALL IN YOUR HEAD: TREATING HEADACHES AND FACIAL PAIN\n129", "ing. This can be caused by a poor bite, but also by all the other\nfactors we discuss in Chapters 2 and 3 and under \ufb01bromyalgia andmyofascial pain in Chapter 6. By treating these same issues (sleep,hormonal de\ufb01ciencies, infections, and nutritional support) themasseter muscles often release and the pain goes away. Because ofthis, dentists often come to my pain workshops and use thesetreatments.\nA simple way to tell if the masseter muscle is contributing to\nyour pain is to put your thumb into your mouth and put itbetween your molars (back teeth) while also placing your secondand third \ufb01ngers about two inches in front of your earlobe. Y ouwill feel a muscle between your thumb and \ufb01ngers. Squeeze themuscle between your thumb and \ufb01ngers and see if it producesmuch pain/tenderness. If so, your TMJ pain may be coming fromthe muscle and not the joint.\nZana\ufb02ex, like other treatments for muscle pain, can be very\nhelpful. In one study, 2 mg of Zana\ufb02ex was taken two times a dayfor two weeks by seventy-eight people with jaw muscle pain. Bythe end of the treatment period, all of the patients had improved;forty-two patients (53.8 percent) showed absence of clinicalsymptoms; eighteen (23.1 percent) showed a good improvementwhile still presenting a low number of painful sites; and eighteen(23.1 percent) showed only a slight improvement.\nIt is also important to be aware that pain and hot/cold sensi-\ntivity in your teeth can come from tight muscles in the face\u2014despite your teeth being totally healthy. It is frightening to seehow many people have had unnecessary root canals because theirdoctor/dentist is not familiar with these pain referral patterns. Fortooth pain in the lower jaw, push on the muscles right below thoseteeth to see if they are tender. Pain in the upper teeth can bereferred from the masseter muscles ( just in front of the ears) orthe pterygoid muscles (a large area by the temples). If these aretender and you do not have obvious tooth problems on yourx-ray/exam, try the pain creams and/or Lidoderm patches and agentle massage over those tender muscles three times a day for aEVALUATING AND TREATING COMMON TYPES OF PAIN\n130", "few weeks to see if you can eliminate the dental pain. These den-\ntal pain referral patterns are described at length (along with treat-ment) in The Trigger Point Manual by Dr. Janet Travell and Dr.\nDavid Simons, which is the best pain book for doctors ever writ-ten. Treating these muscles \ufb01rst is a lot more fun than having rootcanals or having your teeth pulled unnecessarily!\nIn some cases of jaw joint pain, the discomfort is coming from\nthe jaw joint itself. Often, the bite is not in alignment, and thisaggravates the pain. Treating the bite can help. In addition, it ishelpful to be sure that you do not grind your teeth at night (brux-ism) and to have your dentist give you a mouth guard if you do.Often the x-ray will show arthritis or cartilage slipping or loss inthe jaw joint. Some dentists recommend surgery in these situa-tions. I usually recommend that other measures be tried \ufb01rst.IT\u2019S NOT ALL IN YOUR HEAD: TREATING HEADACHES AND FACIAL PAIN\n131", "This page intentionally left blank ", "A Pain in the Gut\nIndigestion, ulcers, acid re\ufb02ux, gastritis, and spastic colon are\ncommon causes of abdominal and chest pains (discussed in Chap-ter 10). If the pain is coming from indigestion or acid re\ufb02ux,drinking a few ounces of Maalox or Mylanta will usually causethe pain to ease up within a few seconds. When this happens,there\u2019s a high probability that your pain is coming from stomachacid. In this situation, it is OK to use Tagamet or other acid block-ers short term to ease your symptoms. I do not feel that it ishealthy to use these medications long term, however, becausestomach acid is necessary for healthy digestion. When you aredealing with spastic colon, treating the underlying infections(especially yeast) can help to alleviate pain.\nResolving Chronic Acid Re\ufb02ux and\nIndigestion Naturally\nWhen you\u2019re having indigestion/re\ufb02ux, it is important to avoid\ncoffee (including decaf ), aspirin/Motrin-related products, andalcohol as all of these can aggravate indigestion.

This is interesting as stomach acid production decreasesdramatically as people get older. However, we seem to forget thathaving stomach acid is both necessary and normal. In fact, thebody has gone to great lengths to be able to produce stomach acidwithout digesting the stomach itself! Y our body needs to haveproper nutrition to make the mucous lining that protects thestomach. Instead of giving our body what it needs to heal, wesometimes make the mistake of turning off our stomach acid tosolve the problem.\nMost indigestion symptoms occur when stomach acid re\ufb02uxes\n(squirts) back up into the food pipe (the esophagus). Y our foodpipe is not made to resist stomach acid, and even a little bit willcause it to burn. Because of this, we take medications that turnoff all the stomach acid. Because there is no stomach acid, theburning stops, and we get deluded into thinking the problem istoo much stomach acid.\nUnfortunately, using antacid medications for an extended\nperiod causes two problems. First, with no stomach acid yourbody is not able to optimally digest food and you become nutri-tionally de\ufb01cient. This makes it even harder for your stomach tomake the mucous lining it needs to protect itself and can set youup for even more re\ufb02ux. Second, in your body\u2019s attempt to makethe stomach acid it desperately needs (when you take antacidmedications), it makes huge amounts of a hormone called gastrin,which stimulates stomach acid. Because of this, as soon as youstop your antacids the stomach makes massive amounts of acid,which it cannot protect itself against. In essence, you becomeaddicted to the antacids. It is no surprise that Prilosec, Nexium,Zantac, and other antacids are some of the biggest moneymakingpharmaceuticals!\nIn mild or occasional cases of acid re\ufb02ux, DGL licorice for a\nfew days may be all you need. For more severe cases, follow theseEVALUATING AND TREATING COMMON TYPES OF PAIN\n134", "directions for a wonderfully effective way to resolve your re\ufb02ux\nand indigestion.\n\u2022Drink sips of warm liquids instead of cold while\neating.

Takeone capsule of Heartburn Free every other day for twentydays. Mastic gum can also eliminate H. pylori infections.\nComing off Prescription Antacids Safely\nAfter you have been on this treatment regimen for one to two\nmonths and are feeling much better, ask your doctor if you canstop your prescription antacids and switch to Tagamet (or stay onthe DGL licorice/mastic gum). This will decrease your stomachacid instead of totally turning it off. By doing this, your body canslowly ease back to a normal production of acid. Decrease thedose of Tagamet or DGL licorice until you are able to come offof it. After two months, most people can stop the licorice/masticgum. They can be used as long as you want, however. If symp-toms recur down the line, simply use the mastic gum or DGLlicorice for a few days. If needed, you can repeat the course ofDGL licorice/mastic gum (and even the Heartburn Free if thestomach infection recurs) whenever you like. Meanwhile, you\u2019llhave broken your addiction to antacids and allowed your body tohave the stomach acid it needs for proper digestion!\nThe Importance of Enzymes for Digestive Health\nUnfortunately, medical schools do not give physicians much infor-mation on proper nutrition or digestive health. Y et how can yourbody stay healthy if it can\u2019t get the nutrition that it needs from food?Enzyme de\ufb01ciencies can contribute to many conditions, including:\n\u2022Indigestion, gas, bloating, diarrhea, and constipation\n\u2022Arthritis and in\ufb02ammatory disorders\n\u2022Fatigue and muscle achesEVALUATING AND TREATING COMMON TYPES OF PAIN\n136", "Proper nutrition is important for all your body\u2019s functions. The\nability to properly digest your food is critical for proper nutritionand the avoidance of toxicity.\nIn medical school, I was taught that the pancreas and salivary\nglands made all of the enzymes you needed to digest your food. Ifthere was a problem with the pancreas, we could always givedigestive enzyme tablets made from an animal pancreas to take careof the problem. This information seems to be woefully de\ufb01cient!\nWhat goes on in real life is that most of the enzymes we need\nto digest the foods we eat are naturally present in the foods. Thisoccurs because fruits and vegetables use enzymes to ripen. As theripening process continues, the food breaks down to where weconsider it to be rotten. From the perspective of an apple or grain,however, this is a perfect stage for the seed to use its food sourceso it can grow into an adult plant. These same plant enzymes workin the acid environment of your stomach, where approximately40 percent of digestion can take place, while animal enzymes can\u2019twork until after they get past the stomach.\nDecades ago, food processors realized that they could prolong\nthe shelf life of food from days to years by destroying the enzymespresent in the food. They also discovered that heat or salicylates (theactive component of aspirin) are very effective ways to destroyenzymes. Over the last thirty years, the processing of foods hasessentially eliminated most of the enzymes present in our food.This corresponds to the period of time in which we have seen adramatic increase in degenerative diseases and indigestion. Mean-while, your poor pancreas has had to pick up the slack and makealmost all the enzymes needed for digestion. Many people realized,however, that if they juiced or ate a raw food diet (cooking can alsodestroy enzymes) they felt dramatically better. Food processors arelearning new tricks, though. By gassing fresh fruits and vegetables,they can destroy the enzymes present even in these fresh foods.This way these foods can look appealing on the grocery shelf forweeks instead of developing those little brown spots that we don\u2019tlike to see. Unfortunately, although the food looks good when youdestroy the enzymes, it has lost much of its nutritional value.A PAIN IN THE GUT\n137", "What Happens When You Don\u2019t Have Enough Enzymes\nWhen you don\u2019t have enough enzymes to adequately digest your\nfood, several things happen. First, you become de\ufb01cient in pro-teins, carbohydrates, and/or fats\u2014depending on which enzymesyou are missing\u2014and you then crave the missing nutrient. By eat-ing excessive amounts of the nutrient you can\u2019t digest, it can buildup in your colon and become toxic. Y ou absorb large chunks ofproteins into your bloodstream before they are broken down totheir component amino acids, and then your immune system hasto treat them as outside invaders, using up its energy completingthe digestion of those foods. This process can exhaust yourimmune system while contributing to food sensitivities. (If youcheck you may \ufb01nd that your temperature goes up around fortyminutes after eating because your immune system has had to makeup for a weak digestive system.)\nThus, your body works poorly because of the nutritional de\ufb01-\nciencies, and you have digestive disturbances. All in all, you feellousy. Y our stomach hurts, and you may have speci\ufb01c food crav-ings. Sound familiar?\nWhy Which Enzymes You Use Matters\nAs noted earlier, it is critical that the enzymes be from plant sources,as animal enzymes do not work in the acid environment of thestomach. Enzymes can also easily be destroyed in processing, soquality is critical. I recommend taking Similase or Complet eGest,\ntwo with each meal. If the enzymes irritate your stomach in thebeginning, as protein-digesting enzymes might, begin with GSSimilase \ufb01rst because this form is gentler on the stomach.\nEliminating Spastic Colon by Treating the\nUnderlying Causes\nAnother painful abdominal problem is spastic colon (also known\nas irritable bowel syndrome), which can occur when you have gas,bloating, abdominal cramps, diarrhea, and/or constipation with anegative medical workup. When physicians do not know what isEVALUATING AND TREATING COMMON TYPES OF PAIN\n138", "causing your symptoms, we give you the label of \u201cspastic colon,\u201d\ninstead of more effectively searching for the source of thesymptoms.\nThe most effective way to eliminate spastic colon is to treat the\nunderlying cause. This is usually infection, and in my experiencemost patients\u2019 spastic colon resolves when the underlying bowelinfections are treated. What is most important is to treat the can-dida/fungal overgrowth in the gut. Unfortunately, most physi-cians still make believe that fungal or yeast overgrowth isnonexistent. This is reminiscent of our early days in medicinewhen we \ufb01rst learned about, but still ridiculed, the possibility ofbacterial infections. Although the research needs to be c ompleted\nto demonstrate the role of fungal infections in chronic illness, alarge body of clinical experience has shown this to be a majorproblem. Many people with yeast overgrowth also \ufb01nd that theyhave chronic sinusitis and/or nasal congestion that go away whenthe fungal infection is treated.\nIn addition, many patients have parasitic infections. For exam-\nple, in my study on the effective treatment of chronic fatigue syn-drome, one out of six of the study patients had a parasite present.Unfortunately, many if not most labs are clueless about how to con-duct a proper stool parasite exam and will miss the vast majority ofthese infections. Because of this, I would only do the parasitologytesting by mail at the Great Smokies Diagnostic Laboratory or theParasitology Center (see Appendix B). If your doctor will not giveyou a lab requisition for this test at these labs, or for any other testsyou may need, you can obtain a lab requisition on my website at nocharge (vitality101.com\u2014click on \u201cDo the Program\u201d and then on\u201cGet a lab requisition\u201d).\nI would also recommend a stool test for Clostridium dif\ufb01cile\ntoxin. Clostridium dif\ufb01cile is a toxin-producing bacteria, and this\ntest can be done at any laboratory. For more information on treat-ing these infections, see Chapter 3 in this book and my book From\nFatigued to Fantastic!\nWhile you\u2019re going after the underlying cause of a spastic\ncolon, there are many treatments you can take for symptomaticA PAIN IN THE GUT\n139", "relief. One natural therapy is peppermint oil. This must be in an\nenteric-coated capsule or it could be quite irritating. Take one totwo capsules three times a day between meals ( notwith food) for\nspastic colon. I recommend Peppermint Plus or Mentharil. Othernatural remedies that can be helpful are Iberogast (digestive sys-tem herbal), twenty drops three times a day in warm water withmeals (takes four to eight weeks to work), or artichoke extract,two 160 mg capsules three times a day. Artichoke extract stimu-lates bile acid release and may help decrease the risk of gallstones.Over-the-counter simethicone (Mylicon) can also be helpful.When chewed, this breaks big gas bubbles into little ones,decreasing the sense of bloating.\nPrescription medications that can be helpful include antispas-\nmodics such as hyoscyamine and Valium family medications suchas Librax. These can be used on an as-needed basis. If constipa-tion is a predominant symptom, adding \ufb01ber and water plus theEnergy Revitalization System vitamin powder can be very help-ful. If these are not adequate, you can take the prescription med-ication MiraLax. In addition, you can add Zelnorm 6 mg twice aday for both constipation and pain.EVALUATING AND TREATING COMMON TYPES OF PAIN\n140", "Dealing with Pelvic Pain\nSyndromes\nPelvic pain can be caused by menstrual cramps, vulvodynia, inter-\nstitial cystitis, endometriosis, or prostadynia. In this chapter, we\u2019llreview each of these.\nInterstitial Cystitis (IC)\nInterstitial cystitis is a bladder problem that causes severe discom-fort in approximately \ufb01ve hundred thousand Americans. Ninetypercent of people affected are women, and the condition oftenoccurs in association with other illnesses such as \ufb01bromyalgia.Onset of symptoms is often between the ages of forty and sixty.On average, people see \ufb01ve doctors before they \ufb01nd one who isable to make the diagnosis. IC is characterized by severe urinaryurgency, frequency, burning, and pain. These symptoms in mildform are common in chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS), \ufb01bromyal-gia, and chronic pain, and are not what I am discussing here. ICis when these symptoms are the predominant problem and areoften so severe that people want to have their bladder removed.\nThe more common category of IC is nonulcerative and is most\noften seen in young to middle-aged women. It is associated withnormal or increased bladder capacity. The cause of IC is notCHAPTER9\n141\nCopyright \u00a9 200 6 by Jacob  Teitelbaum . Click here for terms of use.  ", "known, but there are many theories. In all likelihood, it is caused\nby a number of different problems. One possibility is that thereare infectious triggers, which either irritate the bladder directlyor cause an autoimmune reaction in which the body attacks itself.The autoimmune theory has recently been getting more support.For whatever reason, the protective inner lining of the bladder(called the glycosaminoglycan, or GAG) gets damaged, resultingin severe bladder irritation and pain, urinary urgency and fre-quency, and decreased bladder capacity. Again, it is important topoint out that the symptoms in mild form are very common andare not IC. IC is often associated with vulvar pain and painfulintercourse (discussed later in this chapter). There is no de\ufb01nitivetest for IC, and the diagnosis is based on clinical symptoms andbladder cystoscopy (looking in the bladder with a tube). Otherinfections need to be ruled out, as does cancer.\nHow to Relieve Symptoms with Medications\nAlthough there is currently no cure for interstitial cystitis, thereis much that can be done to relieve the symptoms. Surgery shouldbe a very rare and \ufb01nal resort. Even after the bladder has beenremoved, half of the IC patients will continue to suffer from pain.\nOnce bacterial infections have been ruled out, I add Elavil\n25 mg at bedtime plus Neurontin. If these are ineffective, a trialof Sinequan and the other antiseizure medications are worth-while. The medications Pyridium, which numbs the bladder andturns the urine and sweat light orange, and Urispas, an antispas-modic, can be helpful as well.\nI would also treat the patient for presumptive candida with oral\nDi\ufb02ucan for three months, which may help as well. (See the anti-fungal/antiyeast protocol discussed in Chapter 3.) Although it hasnot been well studied, many physicians suspect that yeast over-growth, like some other infections, may contribute to IC. A crit-ical part of the antiyeast/antifungal protocol is avoiding sugar,which feeds yeast. Interestingly, Dr. Ward Dean had noted thatone person\u2019s IC cleared up when she used xylitol, which looks andEVALUATING AND TREATING COMMON TYPES OF PAIN\n142", "tastes like sugar, as a sugar substitute. It is not clear whether the\nxylitol helped, or simply avoiding the sugar was the reason for thepatient\u2019s relief. Either way, xylitol is a good sugar substitute withmultiple health bene\ufb01ts, including preventing cavities and osteo-porosis, and is worth trying.\nUrologists can also put different medications in the bladder,\nsuch as DMSO and heparin, both of which can be helpful. I rec-ommend the medication Elmiron, which may take three monthsto work. Take a 100 mg capsule three times a day with water atleast one hour before, or two hours after, eating.\nNatural Ways to Relieve Symptoms\nIt is also important to avoid certain foods that may aggravatesymptoms and to recognize that vitamins, especially the B vita-mins and any that are acidic, can dramatically irritate the bladderin some patients with IC. Because of this, supplements, especiallyone as powerful as the Energy Revitalization System vitaminpowder, should be tried in extraordinarily tiny doses (stick a \ufb01n-ger in the powder and lick it) \ufb01rst to make sure they are tolerated.Then slowly increase the dose if you are able. Take any B vitaminswith a large amount of water. Otherwise, they can achieve highconcentrations in the bladder. In most people this causes no prob-lem, but can be irritating in those with IC or bladder spasm. Bvitamins are bright yellow and you can tell when they are con-centrated in the urine.\nDr. Stanley Jacob, M.D., the physician who helped to get FDA\napproval for the use of DMSO (instilled into the bladder) for IC,has also explored the use of methylsulfonylmethane (MSM) totreat IC patients. Although MSM takes longer to work (severalmonths), it is better tolerated than the DMSO, which is irritatingand results in a garlicky body smell. Dr. Jacob estimates that 80percent of his IC patients improve with MSM. He has his patientsmake a formula of 15 percent MSM in deionized sterile water anduse a catheter to put the solution in their bladders (two to \ufb01vetimes a week), holding it in their bladder as long as is comfortable.DEALING WITH PELVIC PAIN SYNDROMES\n143", "He gives the MSM intravenously and by mouth (starting with 1 g\na day and increasing to 18 g daily). For more information, see Dr.Jacob\u2019s book MSM\u2014the De\ufb01nitive Guide .\nLower morning cortisol levels have also been associated with\nincreased symptoms of IC. Many \ufb01bromyalgia patients getmarked improvement in their IC as part of the overall improve-ment of their \ufb01bromyalgia. One of the treatments I often give iscortisol in very low doses.\nAnother natural remedy that has been shown to be helpful in\nIC is the amino acid L-arginine 500 mg three times a day for threemonths. In one study of \ufb01fty-three patients with IC, half weregiven the L-arginine and the other half a placebo. At the end ofthree months, 29 percent of the patients on arginine were feelingbetter with less pain and urgency as compared to 8 percent in theplacebo group. L-arginine helps to make nitric oxide, which canrelax the bladder muscle. The enzyme that makes nitric oxide hasbeen shown to be low in interstitial cystitis patients. In anotheropen study using 1,500 mg of L-arginine daily a similar effect wasseen. Another study using higher amounts did not show bene\ufb01t,so more is not better.\nSome health practitioners have found that patients with inter-\nstitial cystitis often have chronic extremely alkaline urine. Thiscan be aggravated by excessive coffee and cola intake. PH strippaper can be obtained cheaply at most pharmacies, and one cantest multiple urine samples at home to see if the pH is regularlyover 7.0.\nIn addition, certain enzyme therapies by Thera-zyme have\nbeen found to be very helpful. They can be obtained from myof\ufb01ce at 410-573-5389 or from the Thera-zyme company. Forinterstitial cystitis use the enzyme URT. Take four capsules \ufb01vetimes a day between meals; and add the enzyme product calledKDY , two capsules every twenty minutes, as needed during \ufb02ares.In two to four weeks the symptoms may subside and the productscan then be taken just as needed.\nAlthough I have not yet used it for interstitial cystitis, it would\nbe worth trying the herbal saw palmetto, 160 mg twice a day forEVALUATING AND TREATING COMMON TYPES OF PAIN\n144", "six weeks as this relaxes the bladder muscle in those with urinary\nretention and an enlarged prostate. Research shows that this safeherb promotes smooth muscle (the bladder muscle) cell relaxationby a number of different mechanisms. It takes six weeks to work.\nThe good news is that most patients I have seen with IC have\nreceived signi\ufb01cant relief using some combination of thesetreatments.\nPainful Menstrual Cramps and Vulvodynia\nFor menstrual pain, NSAIDs can be very helpful. Y ou can beginwith over-the-counter pain relievers such as Advil or Aleve.\nVulvodynia is de\ufb01ned as chronic vulvar itching, burning, and/\nor pain that is signi\ufb01cantly uncomfortable. In this condition, vul-var/vaginal pain can either occur only during intercourse or beconstantly present. It used to be thought that it was fairly rare.Recently, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) funded a studyto see how common vulvodynia is. According to Dr. Harlow,associate professor of gynecology at Harvard Medical School,\u201cThe preliminary data suggest that possibly millions of womenmay be affected at some point during their lifetime.\u201d The Inter-national Society for the Study of Vulvovaginal Disease has pro-posed several names to describe the different types of vulvodyniawhich include:\n\u2022Generalized vulvar dysesthesia (VDY)\u2014characterized by\npain that can occur anywhere on the vulva\n\u2022Localized vulvar dysesthesia\u2014characterized by pain that can\nbe consistently localized by pushing on certain area(s) of thevulva\n\u2022Mixed dysesthesia\u2014a combination of both of the above\nSymptoms can occur anywhere from the pubic bone to the\nanus. It may be present all of the time, sporadically, or only withintercourse. Many women feel like they have a chronic yeastinfection. In others, it feels raw, swollen, or like they are sittingDEALING WITH PELVIC PAIN SYNDROMES\n145", "on a hard knot. Burning, electric shocks, and tingling are also\noften felt. If the area around the urethra (where the urine comesout) is involved, the woman may feel like she has a chronic blad-der infection. She may have recurrent urinary urgency, frequency,and burning despite having negative urine cultures. Painful inter-course (dyspareunia) is common, and pain may even occur fromtight slacks or panties.\nSome patients have found that for painful intercourse, topical\n0.2 percent nitroglycerine cream can give temporary relief (madeby a compounding pharmacist in a base without any irritatingadditives). In my experience, vulvodynia seems to occur as threemain types: neuropathic, in\ufb02ammatory, or as muscle pain.\nWhen It\u2019s Neuropathic\nNeuropathic vulvodynia appears to be caused by nerve irritationand is sharp, burning, and/or shooting (like nerve pain). In thiscase, apply the treatment principles in Chapter 4 on neuropathicpain. Begin with tricyclic antidepressants (nortriptyline, desipra-mine, imipramine, doxepin, or Elavil) at 25 to 150 mg each nightand/or Neurontin (100 mg to 3,600 mg daily), and proceed fromthere. Be sure to use a high enough dose of the medications andgive them enough time to work, which may take three months.In addition, topical lidocaine (Novocain) gel can be helpful (forexample, EMLA cream). In severe cases, opiates may be necessary.\nWhen It\u2019s In\ufb02ammatory\nWhen vulvodynia pain is associated with local in\ufb02ammation/irri-tation, I would avoid topical creams, especially if they containparabens, propylene glycol, fragrance, or sorbic acid. Also, do notuse topical antifungals or over-the-counter creams. Instead, I rou-tinely give at least a three-month trial of oral Di\ufb02ucan 200 mg aday to be sure any chronic vaginal yeast is eliminated. Occasion-ally, long-term Di\ufb02ucan treatment is needed. In this case, checkliver blood tests occasionall, because this medicine can cause liverin\ufb02ammation. Some patients \ufb01nd that avoiding oxalates can helpdecrease symptoms. In a small subset of patients, one can see aEVALUATING AND TREATING COMMON TYPES OF PAIN\n146", "narrow ring of tissue that is in\ufb02amed and which reproduces the\npain when touched (with a cotton swab). In these patients, surgi-cally removing that small area of tissue is reasonable.\nWhen It\u2019s Muscle Pain\nIf the pain is deep-seated and not triggered by touching the outervagina, it may be coming from spasm of the deep pelvic muscles.In this situation, the pain may occur or be accentuated during thedeep thrusting of intercourse. For this pain, the general principlesfor treating muscle pain apply (see Chapter 6). In addition, EMGbiofeedback of the pelvic \ufb02oor muscles may help vulvodyniacaused by muscle pain. Muscles that are often involved include theobturator internus and pubococcygeus. The sacroiliac joint anddisc/spine disease (see \u201cTreating Disc Disease\u201d in Chapter 10) alsorefer pain to the pelvic and rectal areas. Any injury or conditionaffecting these can trigger pelvic pain.\nImportant Precautions to Take with Vulvodynia\nAs noted earlier, precautions include avoiding any direct chemi-cal contacts that can irritate the vulva such as sprays, creams, orminipads. In addition, it is a good idea to wear loose, comfortableclothes and to avoid thong underwear and biking. Sitz baths canalso be helpful. Menopausal women should use topical naturalestrogen (estradiol) to prevent atrophy.\nMany of my patients with \ufb01bromyalgia also have vulvodynia.\nAs with IC, it seems that symptoms of vulvodynia often resolveas their \ufb01bromyalgia resolves. I put almost all women with pelvicpain on tricyclics such as Elavil or nortriptyline combined withNeurontin.\nEndometriosis\nEndometriosis is a complex disorder affecting females during their\nreproductive years. In this disorder, the tissue that lines the insideof the uterus and sheds each month during the menstrual cycle(called the endometrium) escapes the uterus and attaches to inap-DEALING WITH PELVIC PAIN SYNDROMES\n147", "propriate areas within the pelvis and abdomen. These growths\nthen respond to changes in estrogen just like tissue within theuterus. Because of this, women will often get pelvic and abdomi-nal pains that are worse around their period. These pains are usu-ally worse than menstrual cramps. In addition to pain, womenwith endometriosis often experience myriad other symptoms sim-ilar to \ufb01bromyalgia (fatigue, insomnia, widespread achiness) thatimprove with treatment (see Chapter 6) as well as allergies, asthma,and autoimmune problems. Although the cause of endometriosisis unknown, there are many theories.\nMost doctors forget to consider this diagnosis in evaluating\nabdominal and pelvic pain. The diagnosis is made by laparoscopy.During this surgical procedure, the surgeon makes a small inci-sion and inserts a tube through which he can see the internalorgans to evaluate for endometrial implants. If these implants areseen, the diagnosis is made and treatment is given with hormonaltherapies that attempt to stop ovulation. Pain medications aregiven as well. Pregnancy often causes a temporary remission ofsymptoms. Many alternative therapies are also available.\nAlthough this condition is too complex to be dealt with thor-\noughly in this book, I recommend a book called Endometriosis by\nMary Lou Ballweg and the Endometriosis Association. This orga-nization is located in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, and is dedicated tohelping women with endometriosis.\nProstatitis and Prostadynia\nEven in the absence of a full-blown attack of prostatitis, which isusually not subtle and is easily diagnosed and treated, prostate painis fairly common in men. When no infection is found, it is calledprostadynia . It is also known as chronic nonbacterial prostatitis or\nchronic pelvic pain syndrome (CPPS). Unfortunately, when doctors\ndo not know what is causing a problem, we often presume it mustbe psychological (\u201cI don\u2019t know what\u2019s wrong with you, so youmust be crazy!\u201d). This is what has occurred with prostadynia.EVALUATING AND TREATING COMMON TYPES OF PAIN\n148", "I suspect that prostadynia often occurs because of subtle infec-\ntions that do not grow on our culture media. These commonlyinclude fungal infections and/or other slow-growing antibiotic-sensitive infections. In the latter case, the prostate is mildly boggy(indents like a ripe fruit) instead of \ufb01rm and is tender on exami-nation. Unfortunately, most doctors consider such an exam nor-mal despite your having prostate symptoms. These symptomsinclude urinary urgency without there necessarily being muchurine present and burning on urination. The discomfort is oftenfelt on the tip of the penis. Because the infection is not overt,most doctors offer no treatment.\nMy suspicion is that this is indeed an infectious problem in\nmany cases. This suspicion is bolstered by a recent study showingthat mepartricin (40 mg per day for two months), an antibioticwith antifungal and antiparasitic properties, decreased symptomsby 60 percent in these patients. The study does not totally supportinfection as the cause, however, because the medication also low-ers estrogen levels in the prostate and can work in that way as well.In the study, the authors theorized that lowering estrogen causedthe improvement. My experience, however, shows that patientsalso improve with antibiotics and antifungals that do not lowerestrogen. Treatment needs to be given for many months, sinceanti-infectious agents have dif\ufb01culty getting into the prostate.\nThe bio\ufb02avonoid vitamin quercetin (500 mg twice a day) also\ndecreases prostate symptoms in both prostadynia and prostatitis.In one study, thirty men with severe prostadynia lasting an aver-age of eleven years were treated with either quercetin 500 mgtwice a day or a placebo for one month. There was an average 37percent decrease in symptoms with over two-thirds of patientsfeeling they gained a meaningful bene\ufb01t. Quercetin 500 mg ispresent in the Energy Revitalization System vitamin powder (seeAppendix B).DEALING WITH PELVIC PAIN SYNDROMES\n149", "This page intentionally left blank ", "Treating Other\nCommon Pains \nBased on \nTheir Locations\nIn this chapter, I focus on other common pains that are based on\na speci\ufb01c location in the body. I cover treatments for back pain,one of the most common chronic pain conditions, as well as fornoncardiac chest pain, which is also fairly common and present inabout 10 percent of the population. Pain in the arms and legs isalso discussed in this chapter, including carpal tunnel syndrome,tendonitis, frozen shoulder, leg cramps, plantar fasciitis, and Mor-ton\u2019s neuroma.\nChronic Back Pain\nChronic back pain affects an estimated 36 million Americans. Itis the price we pay for being an upright species. Fortunately, it isalso very treatable. In understanding back pain, it is helpful tounderstand the anatomy of the spine. The spine is made up of a\n151CHAPTER10\nCopyright \u00a9 200 6 by Jacob  Teitelbaum . Click here for terms of use.  ", "column of bones called the vertebrae. From top to bottom, these\nare divided into four sections:\n\u2022The seven cervical (neck) vertebrae (C1\u2013C7)\n\u2022The twelve thoracic (upper back) vertebrae (T1\u2013T12)\n\u2022The \ufb01ve lumbar (lower back) vertebrae (L1\u2013L5)\n\u2022The sacrum plus the tailbone (coccyx) at the bottom of the\nspine\nThe bones/vertebrae of the spinal column are held together by\ntendons, ligaments, and muscles. Between the vertebrae are shockabsorbers called discs. These \ufb02exible pads of cartilage contain liq-uid. If this liquid leaks out, it can trigger in\ufb02ammation andswelling, which pinches on the nerve roots, causing pain. Byeliminating the tissue swelling using intravenous colchicine (dis-cussed later), disc pain can be eliminated approximately 70 per-cent of the time without surgery!\nThe spinal cord itself is a critical bundle of nerve cells that are\ninside the spinal column and protected by it. At each of the ver-tebrae, nerve roots come out of the front of the spinal columncarrying information from the brain to the body and nerve rootsenter the back of the spinal column bringing information fromthe body to the brain. Compression of, or dam age to, these nerve\nroots causes pain and loss of sensation and function.\nIt\u2019s always good to start with the basics when considering treat-\nment for back pain. For example, in one study people with lowback pain who slept on a medium \ufb01rm mattress had less back painthan those who slept on a \ufb01rm mattress. Distraction and relax-ation, such as listening to relaxing music for one half-hour dailyfor three weeks, also reduced back pain by 40 percent.\nTreating Disc Disease\nIn disc disease, the nerve is being pinched as it comes out of thespine. As the vertebrae and discs (the building blocks that makeup the spine) develop wear and tear, the discs, which act as shockEVALUATING AND TREATING COMMON TYPES OF PAIN\n152", "absorbers between the vertebrae, sometimes rupture, and the \ufb02uid\ninside of the disc leaks out. As noted earlier, this disc \ufb02uid cancause in\ufb02ammation and swelling that can compress the nerve as itenters the spine, causing pain. MRIs and x-rays are poor indica-tors of whether the pain is coming from disc disease (rather thanfrom tight muscles or muscle spasm pinching the nerve) as almosteveryone shows normal \u201cwear and tear\u201d in back x-rays.\nFortunately, over 70 percent of back pain from disc disease can\nbe eliminated without surgery by simply giving six intravenousinjections of an old gout medicine called colchicine. Given intra-venously, this medicine gets into the disc space and turns off thein\ufb02ammation and swelling. Relief usually occurs by the \ufb01fth tosixth dose. It is fairly safe, with the main risk being rare and severeallergic reactions (similar to the risk with penicillin) and a nastyskin burn if it leaks out of the IV (the medication has to stay inthe vein, not anywhere else). This can usually be easily avoidedby making sure the IV is \ufb02owing well. I usually recommend thatas long as the IV is in, you also get the IV nutrients in Myers cock-tails (see Chapter 11) because this helps associated muscle pain.T wo studies with more than one thousand patients (one studybeing placebo controlled) have shown the same 70 percent reliefrate that I and others who use it in practice have found. Only onestudy (conducted with fourteen long-term workman\u2019s c ompensa-\ntion patients who had failed all other treatments, where no treat-ment was likely to help) did not show bene\ufb01t.\nThe main problem with the use of IV colchicine in disc dis-\nease is that it is too inexpensive. It costs three dollars per dose forsix doses, with the main cost being that of starting the IV . Becausethere is no money to be made, and it would eliminate most backsurgeons\u2019 business, surgeons are understandably hesitant to look atthe research. One excellent local orthopedist had a staffer whohad disc disease for many years but refused surgery. When shecame to our of\ufb01ce, we treated her with the IV colchicine and thedisc pain, as usual, went away. One night, my partner and I wereout for dinner when the orthopedist entered the restaurant. WhenTREATING OTHER COMMON PAINS BASED ON THEIR LOCATIONS\n153", "he came over to say hello, my partner asked the orthopedist what\nhe thought about his staffer\u2019s pain going away without needingsurgery. The orthopedist ignored the comment and kept on talk-ing as if we had never asked the question.\nTreating Sciatica. Sciatica, or back pain in which the pain goes\ndown the leg, is very common. Sciatica is simply disc disease fromcompression or irritation of the nerve from the foot as it entersthe spine (although a tight muscle can also pinch the nerve). If youlie on the \ufb02oor and lift the painful leg straight up without bend-ing it (while keeping the other leg \ufb02at on the \ufb02oor), it can stretchthe nerve and worsen the pain. This is called the straight leg rais-\ning test . Sciatica also usually goes away by treatment with intra-\nvenous colchicine.\nAdditional Treatments for Disc Disease. It is reasonable to add glu-\ncosamine sulfate, 1,500 mg a day; MSM, 3,000 mg per day; andchondroitin sulfate, 2,500 mg per day. Give this combination a\nsix- to twelve-week trial. In one Russian study, 73 percent ofthose who took the chondroitin had less back pain and moremobility. As noted above, use only low molecular weight chon-droitin (such as the one made by Enzymatic Therapy) as mostothers are poorly absorbed. These compounds may help to rebuildthe cartilage tissue worn away by wear and tear.\nLamictal (lamotrigine, a seizure medicine that acts as a sodium\nchannel blocker with some calcium channel blockade) can also behelpful. In one study with patients who had severe refractory neu-ropathic pain (especially disc pain) and had failed at least twoother treatments, there was an average 70 percent drop in pain infourteen of twenty-one patients using this medication.\nWhat If It Is Not Disc Disease?\nMost other back pain, unless it is coming from your chest orabdominal organs (which is rare and can be found by yourinternist) is muscular. Using the treatments in the chapter onmyofascial pain (Chapter 6) and also taking care of any underly-EVALUATING AND TREATING COMMON TYPES OF PAIN\n154", "ing structural/ergonomic problems (see Chapters 3 and 12) can\nroutinely eliminate this pain. In addition, chiropractic (see Chap-ter 12) and mind-body approaches such as those developed by Dr.Sarno (see Chapter 14) can also be very helpful, as can manyforms of bodywork.\nNoncardiac Chest Pain\nOnce your doctor has ruled out heart or lung problems as a sourceof your chest pain, it most often turns out to be muscle/cartilagepain or indigestion/acid re\ufb02ux. A diagnosis of costoc hondritis\u2014\npain in the chest wall muscles and cartilage\u2014is made by exami-nation and ruling out other problems since lab and other studiesprovide little information about muscle pain. Interestingly, mus-cle pain over the lower half of the chest bone (sternum) is involvedin a re\ufb02ex arc that can both cause and be caused by acid re\ufb02ux.Treating this muscle pain can decrease re\ufb02ux problems as well.\nCostochondritis pain tends to be aggravated by movement,\ndeep breathing, or position change. It tends to be sharp, nagging,aching, or pressure-like, and it is usually fairly well localized,although the pain may radiate. It is usually along the sides of thesternum (the chest bone in the center of the chest), two inchesbelow the left nipple, or in the pectoral muscles in the upper chest.Reproducing the chest pain by pushing on the area suggests thatthe pain is coming from the muscles or ligaments of the chest walland is not dangerous. Nonetheless, it is best to be on the safe sideand have a physician make sure that the pain is not coming fromthe heart.\nHot compresses and relaxing the muscles with your mind can\nbe helpful, as can the treatments for muscle pain discussed inChapter 6. For severe cases, Lidocaine patches can be very help-ful, as can the pain creams. Aspirin family medications such asMotrin can be helpful but can cause indigestion or stomach ulcersand bleeding, which can worsen the chest pain.\nIf the pain is in your solar plexus and midchest and is relieved\nby taking a few ounces of Maalox, Mylanta, or other antacids, orTREATING OTHER COMMON PAINS BASED ON THEIR LOCATIONS\n155", "is affected by eating, it is likely indigestion. (See Chapter 8 for\ninformation on treating pain from indigestion.)\nWhen to Worry\nThe most worrisome causes of chest pain, however, are anginaand heart attacks. These pains are usually associated with tightnessand pain that radiates down the left arm, shortness of breath, andsweats and is made worse with walking or exercise. Everyone isdifferent, however, and sometimes these pains can be atypical. Itis always best to be on the safe side and have a family doctor checkout the source of chest pain to be sure it is not coming from some-thing dangerous. Most doctors are very good at diagnosing andtreating angina and other dangerous causes of chest pain. Oncethese have been ruled out, I would go ahead and apply the treat-ments described in this chapter to help eliminate your chest pain.\nCarpal Tunnel Syndrome and Thumb Tendonitis\nCarpal tunnel syndrome is characterized by pain, numbness, andtingling that occurs in one or both hands. It often wakes peoplefrom their sleep, leaving them feeling like they have to \u201cshaketheir hands out\u201d to make the pain and symptoms go away. Thissyndrome is caused by compression of the median nerve as it goesthrough a narrow tunnel in the wrist formed by the carpal bone,hence the name carpal tunnel syndrome. According to the Amer-ican Academy of Neurology, 10 percent of the population suffersfrom the syndrome. It also affects up to 50 percent of industrialworkers.\nAll too often the syndrome is treated by surgery. Although this\ncan be effective, it is also expensive and can leave people withresidual problems due to the formation of scar tissue that canoccur after surgery.\nNonsurgical Treatment Options for Wrist Pain\nFortunately, unless people are continuing to stress the wrist withrepetitive stress injuries (such as handling heavy equipment orEVALUATING AND TREATING COMMON TYPES OF PAIN\n156", "doing large amounts of typing), carpal tunnel syndrome can\nalmost always be relieved without surgery. In almost all of mypatients, their carpal tunnel syndromes have resolved by simplyusing vitamin B\n6(250 mg daily), Armour thyroid hormone (see\nChapter 2), and a wrist splint for six weeks. When your hand getsinto funny positions while you are sleeping, it stretches and strainsthe nerve as it goes through your wrist. This is why you wake upin the night with numbness or tingling. The type of wrist splintto use is called a \u201ccock up\u201d wrist splint. It keeps your hand in theneutral position (the position your hand is in while holding a glassof water), which takes the stress off the nerve. Be sure to wear thesplint for at least six weeks while you\u2019re sleeping. During thatperiod, also wear it during the day when you can.\nAlthough the treatment I mentioned generally takes care of\ncarpal tunnel syndrome, it is worth being aware of a new treat-ment as well. A portable wrist traction device combines neutralwrist position and stretching to decompress the carpal tunnel. Itis used ten minutes twice a day for one month, followed by tenminutes once a day for a second month. It can be used at home orat work, making it very convenient. At the end of a study ofthirty patients, most had normalization or near normalization ofthe nerve function.\nOther conservative measures can also be effective, including\nacupuncture, osteopathic manipulation, chiropractic manipula-tion, and myofascial release. Unfortunately, your doctor may betotally unfamiliar with these conservative therapies; in today\u2019smedicine only expensive treatments tend to get attention. If sur-gery is recommended, ask your physician if you can try these con-servative measures instead for six to twelve weeks.\nThumb Tendonitis\nThumb tendonitis is characterized by pain along the side of yourhand going from the thumb joint toward the wrist. If you feelaround, you may \ufb01nd a \u201cropy\u201d cord (the tendon) that hurts, withthe pain worsening when you push on it. The pain gels/creams(see Chapters 3, 4, and 13, and see Appendix B for sources) canTREATING OTHER COMMON PAINS BASED ON THEIR LOCATIONS\n157", "work very well for this; but you need to give these medications\nseveral weeks to work. Steroid injections locally are also reason-able, but should not be injected into the tendon.\nShoulder Problems\nFrozen shoulder has many causes, including tendon in\ufb02ammation,bursitis, and injury. Anything that causes pain on motion can trig-ger it. This occurs as the patient stops moving the shoulderbecause of the pain. The shoulder gradually loses mobility, andscar tissue can form around the shoulder joint causing it tobecome frozen. Rotator cuff tears are a common cause. If youhave shoulder pain and \ufb01nd that you can only lift your arm up toshoulder level to the side (a 90-degree angle), a rotator cuff tear islikely.\nThe usual treatments include NSAIDs (discussed in Chapter\n13) and physical therapy (heat, ultrasound, and range of motionexercises). Cortisone injections can also be given. If these treat-ments fail after six to twelve months, surgery to repair the jointmay sometimes be necessary.\nWhen doing range of motion exercises, increase the joint\nmovement up to the point where it causes mild pain, but do notpush through pain as this can further injure the joint. Severalgood stretches for the shoulder include:\n\u2022Using your other hand to lift your hand up to the top of a\ndoor (so that your hand holds on to the top of the door),gently squat down to stretch the shoulder.\n\u2022Putting your arm behind your back and using your other\nhand to gently pull on it and stretch it. (This can also bedone with your arm over your head.)\nIt is good to be sure that you maintain range of motion of your\nshoulder anytime you have shoulder pain to prevent a frozenshoulder.EVALUATING AND TREATING COMMON TYPES OF PAIN\n158", "Leg and Foot Pain\nIn some people, the calf and other leg muscles go into spasm while\nthey are sleeping. A number of treatments can prevent this.\n\u2022Begin by taking the Energy Revitalization System vitamin\npowder (take the vitamin B-complex capsule in the morningand the powder at night).\n\u2022In addition, take calcium 500 to 1,000 mg at bedtime and\nincrease the potassium in your diet (bananas, V8, andtomato juice are good sources of potassium).\n\u2022Stretch your calf muscles before you go to sleep. This can be\ndone by pulling your toes toward you when you\u2019re sitting onyour bed.\n\u2022Wearing socks at night can also help because cold feet will\nsometimes be a trigger.\n\u2022Quinine can be helpful for nighttime leg cramps as well.\nFor most of my patients, the nutritional support I recommend\nplus quinine has done an excellent job in relieving pain from legcramps. Interestingly, several readers of Dr. Peter Gott\u2019s medicalcolumn have noted that leaving a bar of soap (but not Dove orDial soap) under their bed sheet stopped their leg cramps. It seemsodd, but it is cheap, safe, and easy to try.\nFoot Problems\nPlantar fasciitis is the most common cause of pain along the entirebottom of the foot. It occurs when you have a tightness/irritationof the muscles and tissues that form the \u201csuspension bridge\u201d onthe bottom of the foot. This is very common in my \ufb01bromyalgiapatients and routinely goes away with the overall treatment pro-tocol (see Chapter 6). In addition, a podiatrist or chiropractorfamiliar with the technique can tape the bottom of the foot. Thiswas another wonderful trick that Dr. Ron Huse taught me. Thistape then takes over the role of the suspension support and mayease the pain immediately.TREATING OTHER COMMON PAINS BASED ON THEIR LOCATIONS\n159", "Morton\u2019s neuroma is an irritated nerve bundle in the web\nbetween two toes.

We will also review pre-scription pain medications that include topical therapies (creams andgels that can be rubbed directly on the painful areas), oral pain med-ications, and intravenous medications.

As one goes into academic centers, this onlyincreases. Although many physicians think that their bias is basedon lack of scienti\ufb01c evidence supporting natural therapies (whatthey like to call \u201cevidence-based medicine\u201d), it is actually simplybased on a lack of awareness of the scienti\ufb01c data.\nMany physicians refuse to objectively look at studies that sup-\nport natural medicine. The people in charge of grants will rarelygive money to study natural therapies. All too often, journalreviewers look for any excuse they can not to publish \ufb01ndings,and many doctors refuse to look at a positive study on naturaltherapies once it is published. Thus physicians can honestly saythey have not seen any data supporting natural remedies. On theother hand, any data against natural remedies seem to get pub-lished\u2014no matter how poorly done the study was and how unre-liable the data are.\nI have repeatedly seen this in action, and this is not just my\nown impression. A study was conducted in which two identicalstudy reports were submitted for publication. The only differencewas that in one study the treatment was an \u201cunconventional\u201dtherapy while the other was a \u201cconventional\u201d treatment. A totalof 398 reviewers were recruited and did not know they were part\n163CHAPTER11\nCopyright \u00a9 200 6 by Jacob  Teitelbaum . Click here for terms of use.  ", "of a study. They simply thought they were reviewing the study\nreports to see whether they should be published. Although thestudy reports were exactly the same (except for using a \u201cconven-tional\u201d or \u201cunconventional\u201d treatment), the studies using con-ventional therapies were much more likely to be recommendedfor publication, suggesting that a strong prejudice exists againstalternative interventions. This makes it much harder for such stud-ies to get published and also suggests that it would be more dif\ufb01-cult to get research funding for studies supporting naturaltherapies.\nWhy Does a Bias Against Natural Remedies Exist?\nA curious thing happened during the rigorous process I wentthrough to become a physician. By the time I completed my for-mal training, I presumed that if an important treatment existed foran illness, I would have been taught about it. I understood thatphysicians need to keep reading to stay abreast of new informa-tion. But I knew that if someone claimed he or she could effec-tively treat a nontreatable disease, that person was a quack. If sucha treatment existed, I would surely have been taught about it inmedical school. I was wrong.\nDr. Werner Barth, my rheumatology instructor, taught me\nmany things. The most important thing he taught me, though,was to spend an hour a day reading the scienti\ufb01c literature. Thispractice has gotten me into all kinds of trouble.\nWhen I \ufb01rst started my medical practice, patients would ask\nme if I knew about certain herbal or nutritional treatments for ill-nesses. One patient asked me if I had ever heard about using vita-min B \u2086for carpal tunnel syndrome. \u201cThat\u2019s nonsense,\u201d I answered.\n\u201cIf B \u2086cures carpal tunnel syndrome, don\u2019t you think I would have\nbeen taught to use that instead of surgery?\u201d However, I said thatI would look into it.\nJoyce Miller, the Anne Arundel Medical Center librarian, has\nalways been happy to obtain studies for me (and she has obtainedEFFECTIVE THERAPIES FOR CHRONIC PAIN AND RELATED PROBLEMS\n164", "many thousands over the years). When she did a literature search\nfor vitamin B \u2086and carpal tunnel syndrome, she found a number\nof studies showing that 250 mg of the vitamin per day for threemonths, combined with wrist splints, often cures carpal tunnelsyndrome. I thought that was curious. Over the months, this scenewas played out again and again. I decided to keep notes on theserare \u201cpearls\u201d in a thirty-page spiral notebook. My notes are nowover one thousand pages long.\nAfter a while, I began to comprehend that, indeed, my pro-\nfessors had not taught me everything in medical school. As Icontinued my research, I realized that although our modernallopathic medical system might be the best in the world, it hasits weaknesses.\nMoney: A Critical Issue\nMoney strongly colors drug research; there is much more moneyto be made on patentable drugs than on nonpatentable naturalremedies. In fact, research done by Cary Gross at Yale shows thatstudies funded by a drug company are 3.6 times as likely to havea result favorable to the sponsor. A quarter of biomedical research-ers have \ufb01nancial ties to the companies whose products they arestudying. Drug companies fund approximately 60 percent of thebiomedical research done in the United States, spending over $30billion yearly on research and development. In addition, becauseuniversities can patent and license the results of positive research,there is a further incentive to skew the data on drug therapies overnatural, nonpatentable treatments.\nIn addition, these days, it is rare (albeit wonderful) for a major\nmedical development to come out of a doctor\u2019s of\ufb01ce instead of aresearch center. This stems from a critical drawback in our eco-nomic system (and all systems have their drawbacks). In our cur-rent system, a treatment must be very pro\ufb01table to be promoted.Experts estimate that it costs more than $400 million on averageto develop a single new treatment and get it through the Food andDrug Administration (FDA) approval process. Unless a medica-NATURAL THERAPIES\n165", "tion or supplement is put through the FDA approval process, its\nmanufacturer is banned from making any medical claims for theproduct. However, if a product is inexpensive and nonpatentable(as is the case with most natural therapies), its manufacturer can-not afford to pay $400 million to put it through the FDA process.\nVitamin B \u2086, when used for carpal tunnel syndrome, is an excel-\nlent example. Treating carpal tunnel syndrome with B \u2086costs about\nnine dollars for the whole course of treatment. Vitamin B \u2086man-\nufacturers would, therefore, \ufb01nd it impossible to recoup the costof getting FDA approval for this treatment. Because of this, mostpatients instead spend between two thousand and four thousanddollars to have surgery. This situation is the same for hundreds ofother nonpatentable, effective, inexpensive, and relatively safetreatments.\nNot Knowing the Scienti\ufb01c Research\nThe treatment approaches that we discuss in Pain Free 1-2-3 are\nwell-grounded in the scienti\ufb01c literature. Dr. Janet Travell, pro-fessor emeritus of internal medicine at George Washington Uni-versity Medical School, was considered the world\u2019s leading experton muscle disorders. She served as the White House physician forPresidents John F . Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson and, alongwith Dr. David Simons (who is also superb), authored the overeight-hundred-page bible on treating muscle disorders entitledMyofascial Pain and Dysfunction: The Trigger Point Manual . Dr.\nTravell and Dr. Simons investigated the perpetuating factors thatkeep muscles from appropriately relaxing. A large percentage ofthese perpetuating factors are the things that we discuss in thisbook. In one chapter alone, Dr. Simons and Dr. Travell referenced317 scienti\ufb01c studies that showed how important it is to treat theseperpetuating factors. There is no lack of scienti\ufb01c basis for treat-ment, just a lack of awareness of the treatments due to their rela-tive low cost and nonpatentability.\nUnfortunately, your doctor is likely to be unfamiliar with the\nresearch on effective treatment of myofascial pain and \ufb01bromyal-EFFECTIVE THERAPIES FOR CHRONIC PAIN AND RELATED PROBLEMS\n166", "gia. It is possible that your doctor may even be hostile to the\ninformation presented in this book, considering it to be quackerybecause it was not covered in medical school. I can understand hisor her feeling this way, because I felt the same way before I exten-sively reviewed the medical literature. Because of this, I have ref-erenced many of the sources of the information given so that yourdoctor can have the scienti\ufb01c basis needed to be comfortable withthe recommendations I make.\nIt is possible that your doctor may choose to disregard the\ninformation, and that is OK. It simply says that he or she is notinterested in this area of pain management. On the other hand,your doctor might be open-minded (though reasonably skeptical)and interested in effective treatment of pain and, therefore, maychoose to explore the subject in more depth. If this last possibil-ity is the case, the information and references in this book willgive your doctor the scienti\ufb01c basis necessary to manage and opti-mize your treatment.\nThree Effective Natural Pain Therapies\nMany natural therapies can be very helpful for pain. My threefavorite pain-relieving herbals are willow bark, boswellia, andcherry. All three can be found in combination in the End Painformula by Enzymatic Therapy (see Appendix B). Begin with twoto four tablets three times a day, as needed, until maximum ben-e\ufb01t is achieved (approximately four to six weeks), and then youcan use the lowest effective dose. For acute pain three or fourtablets at a time is best. Let\u2019s look more closely at these threeherbals.\nWillow Bark\nWillow bark is the original source of aspirin, but when used as theentire herb it has been found to be much safer than aspirin andmore effective. The active ingredient is salicin, and willow barkhas been shown to be effective in both osteoarthritis and backNATURAL THERAPIES\n167", "pain. People who are severely allergic to aspirin (those with\naspirin-induced asthma or anaphylaxes, which are very unusual)should not use willow bark. Like aspirin and Celebrex, willowbark acts as a cyclooxygenase enzyme (COX) inhibitor, decreas-ing in\ufb02ammation.\nThere is clearly a combination of other elements in willow\nbark that markedly enhances its effectiveness and safety\u2014whichcan be a major bene\ufb01t over aspirin and NSAIDs such as Motrin.Unfortunately aspirin and NSAIDs cause an enormous amount ofgastritis and ulcer bleeding to the extent of killing \ufb01fteen thou-sand to twenty thousand Americans yearly! The studies on wil-low bark are quite consistent in showing its effectiveness andsafety in reducing pain. Let\u2019s look at some of the research.\nIn one study, 210 patients with severe chronic low back pain\nwere randomly assigned to receive an oral willow bark extract,with either 120 mg (low dose) or 240 mg (high dose) of salicin,or placebo, in a four-week blinded trial. In the last week of treat-ment, 39 percent of the group receiving high-dose extract werepain free; 21 percent of the group receiving low-dose extractwere pain free; and only 6 percent of the placebo group were painfree. The response in the high-dose group was evident after onlyone week of treatment. Researchers then studied 451 patientswho came in with low back pain in an open study, using salicin240 mg, 120 mg, or standard orthopedic/NSAID care for fourweeks. Forty percent of the patients in the 240 mg group and 19percent in the 120 mg group were pain free after four weeks. Inthe standard treatment group, using standard medications, only 18percent were pain free. The study showed that willow bark wasnot only far more effective and safer than standard prescriptiontherapies, it also decreased the cost of care by approximately 40percent!\nAnother review found that willow bark extract has anti-\nin\ufb02ammatory activities comparable to much higher doses ofacetylsalicylic acid/aspirin, and it reduces pain and fever as well.In pharmacologically active doses, no adverse effects on the stom-EFFECTIVE THERAPIES FOR CHRONIC PAIN AND RELATED PROBLEMS\n168", "ach lining (indigestion, ulcers) were observed, in contrast to\naspirin.\nA daily dose of willow bark extract standardized to 240 mg\nsalicin per day was also signi\ufb01cantly superior to placebo in patientswith osteoarthritis of the hip and the knee. In two open studiesagainst standard active treatments as controls, willow bark extractexhibited advantages compared to NSAIDs and was about aseffective as Vioxx (but much safer). Another study found that wil-low bark (salicin 240 mg/day) was much more effective thanplacebo in treating arthritis (the normal wear-and-tear type calledosteoarthritis) after only two weeks of therapy.\nAll of this information makes willow bark a wonderful natu-\nral pain medicine. It is safe and effective for arthritis, back pain,and likely many other types of pain. I recommend beginning withenough to get 240 mg of salicin a day (six tablets of the End Painformula) until maximum bene\ufb01t is seen. At that point, you maybe able to lower the dose to 120 mg or less a day, or take it asneeded.\nBoswellia\nBoswellia serrata , also known as frankincense, has been used in tra-\nditional Ayurvedic medicine for centuries. Boswellia has beenfound to be quite helpful in treating in\ufb02ammation and pain, andit does this without causing ulcers like aspirin family medications.It has been shown in studies to be helpful for both rheumatoidarthritis and osteoarthritis.\nIn one study, thirty patients with osteoarthritis of the knee\nwere given 1,000 mg of either an extract of boswellia or a placebofor eight weeks; the groups were then switched for the next eightweeks. All of the patients on the boswellia showed signi\ufb01cantlydecreased pain and improved ability to walk. In fact, the improve-ment was quite remarkable, with the pain index falling by 90 per-cent after eight weeks and a similarly dramatic increase infunction! This was recently discussed in more length in an articlewritten by Kerry Bone for the wonderful patient-oriented news-NATURAL THERAPIES\n169", "letter Nutrition and Healing by Jonathan Wright, M.D.\u2014a physi-\ncian that I have great respect for. (See wrightnewsletter.com.)\nBoswellia has also been demonstrated to have signi\ufb01cant anti-\nin\ufb02ammatory properties. Unique to boswellia is that it blocks twoin\ufb02ammatory chemicals that are increased simultaneously in avariety of human diseases. This results in its being helpful inasthma and colitis, as well as pain. In one study of asthmatics,forty patients were treated with 300 mg three times day for sixweeks. Seventy percent of the asthma patients showed improve-ment in symptoms and lung function and a decrease in allergicblood cells (eosinophils).\nBoswellia also helped in the treatment of ulcerative colitis. In\none study of twenty patients in which boswellia, 300 mg threetimes a day, was given for six weeks, fourteen went into remis-sion, while with sulfasalazine (the standard prescription treat-ment), the remission rate was four out of ten. T est tube studiessuggest that Boswellia also markedly inhibits cancer.\nBoswellia does not appear to have any major side effects that\nresulted in people withdrawing from the studies, and it rarelycauses minor gastrointestinal disturbances or rash. A commondose is 150 to 350 mg three times a day.\nCherry (Prunus Cerasus)\nAlthough there are not as many human studies on the use of cher-ries, they also contain compounds that inhibit COX (in\ufb02amma-tion) as effectively as ibuprofen. Cherries also possess bothantioxidant and anti-in\ufb02ammatory properties. In addition,research suggests that cherries may also inhibit colon and perhapsother cancers. Cherries and other colored berries are very high inmany antioxidants. As with eating cherries, taking cherry fruitextract is quite safe. Many people \ufb01nd that eating ten to twentycherries a day helps their arthritis considerably. Taking 2,000 mgof cherry fruit extract (present in six tablets of the End Pain for-mula) contains the active components present in ten cherries orthirty-two ounces of cherry juice. Early research, as well as howEFFECTIVE THERAPIES FOR CHRONIC PAIN AND RELATED PROBLEMS\n170", "many people come back for more after they have tried it, which\nto me is a signi\ufb01cant indicator of effectiveness, suggests thatcherry fruit extract holds a lot of promise!\nOther Important Natural Healing Ingredients\nAs we discussed earlier, pain is often your body\u2019s way of tellingyou that it desperately needs something\u2014and what it needs is usu-ally natural and not chemical. Let\u2019s review the key things yourbody needs and how you can give it what it needs naturally.\nNutritional Support\nFirst you need to give your body the nutritional building blocksit needs to heal. Otherwise, your body cannot even begin to getwell (see Chapter 2). As you\u2019ve noticed, I\u2019ve talked about theEnergy Revitalization System vitamin powder and B-complexcapsule at length. This is because this formula has over \ufb01fty keynutrients that serve an enormous number of needs. Many peoplehave told me that using the formula by itself eliminated theirchronic pain!\nGlucosamine Sulfate and Chondroitin\nNext, although the vitamin powder has most of what your bodyneeds, joints require other speci\ufb01c nutrients for healing. So if youhave arthritis or back pain from arthritis of the spine, considertaking glucosamine sulfate, MSM (methylsulfonylmethane), andchondroitin (see Chapter 5).\nLipoic Acid and SAM-e\nOther nutrients are also critical for nerve healing. One such ele-ment is lipoic acid, 300 to 1,000 mg per day. Alpha lipoic acid isan antioxidant that has been shown to be especially bene\ufb01cial fordiabetic neuropathy. The fact that lipoic acid helps in several kindsof neuropathies suggests it is worth trying in others as well, espe-cially since it is quite benign and not very expensive.NATURAL THERAPIES\n171", "SAM-e is a nutrient produced from trimethylglycine (betaine)\nin combination with multiple nutrients, including B vitamins,folate, and inositol. It was initially tested and found to be effectivein treating depression. Researchers also noted, as an aside, that itimproved patients\u2019 arthritis as effectively as anti-in\ufb02ammatorymedications (NSAIDs) (see Chapter 5).\nNatural Remedies for Sleep\nAs previously discussed in Chapter 2, your repair cycle occursduring sleep and your body needs eight to nine hours of sleep anight for optimal healing. Unfortunately, insomnia often accom-panies pain. The good news is that many natural remedies that arevery effective for sleep also directly help pain. Most of the natu-ral sleep remedies discussed here are not sedating, yet they willhelp you fall asleep and stay in deep sleep. Some are available incombination formulas as well.\nWild Lettuce and Jamaican Dogwood\nTraditionally, wild lettuce has been found to be wonderful foranxiety and insomnia, as well as for headaches, muscles, and jointpain. Wild lettuce also helps to calm restlessness and reduceanxiety.\nIn addition, the extract from Jamaican dogwood acts as a mus-\ncle relaxant and also helps people to fall asleep while calmingthem. According to tradition, Jamaican dogwood was used byJamaican \ufb01shermen. Large amounts were thrown in the water.The \ufb01sh would then be sedated and easy to net.\nHops and Theanine\nHops are a member of the hemp family, and the female \ufb02owers areused in beer making. Hops stimulate some hormonal activity; cansuppress breast, colon, and ovarian cancer in test tube studies; andhave been reported to reduce hot \ufb02ashes in menopausal women.Hops are also associated with antibiotic and antifungal activity.EFFECTIVE THERAPIES FOR CHRONIC PAIN AND RELATED PROBLEMS\n172", "They have a long history of being used as a mild sedative for anx-\niety and insomnia. They also inhibit in\ufb02ammation. A study using120 mg of hops combined with 500 mg of valerian showed animprovement in insomnia with effectiveness similar to Valiumfamily medications. Hops are considered to be very safe.\nTheanine comes from green tea and has been shown to\nimprove deep sleep and to help people maintain calm alertnessduring the day. Green tea also is helpful as an immune stimulantand has many other bene\ufb01ts.\nPassion\ufb02ower (Passi\ufb02ora)\nPassion\ufb02ower is an excellent herb used throughout South Amer-ica as a calming agent and is even present in sodas. In fact, it is notuncommon for friends to tell an anxious person, \u201cWhy don\u2019t yougo get a passion\ufb02ower drink.\u201d The active component is in theleaves. Herbalists use passion\ufb02ower to treat muscle spasms, colic,dysentery, diarrhea, anxiety, and menstrual pain. A number ofstudies support its having a calming effect. Early data also suggestthat it may increase men\u2019s libido. Passion\ufb02ower has other painmanagement bene\ufb01ts as well. In one animal study, it was shownto decrease morphine tolerance and withdrawal, thereby improv-ing morphine\u2019s effectiveness and safety.\nValerian\nValerian is commonly used as a remedy for insomnia. Oneplacebo-controlled study showed that people taking valerian(400 mg of extract each night for two weeks) fell asleep morequickly and had better sleep quality without next-day sedation.Another placebo-controlled study using 450 and 900 mg doses forjust one night also showed improved sleep, but there was somehangover with the higher dose. A number of other studies alsoshow bene\ufb01t, including an improvement in deep sleep. The ben-e\ufb01ts were most pronounced when people used valerian forextended periods as opposed to simply taking it for one night.Another study showed it to be as effective as a Valium familyNATURAL THERAPIES\n173", "medication (oxazepam). A review of multiple studies concluded,\n\u201cValerian is a safe herbal choice for the treatment of mild insom-nia and has good tolerance.\u201d Most studies suggest that it is moreeffective when used continuously rather than as an acute sleep aid.\nCombining Remedies for Fuller Effect\nBecause I have found all six of these herbals to be dramaticallyhelpful in patients with disordered sleep, anxiety, and/or chronicpain, I had them all combined in the Revitalizing Sleep Formula(see Appendix B). One to four capsules can be taken at bedtimeto help sleep, or an hour before bedtime if the main problem isfalling asleep. Y ou\u2019ll see the effect of a given dose on sleep the \ufb01rstnight you take it, although the effectiveness increases with con-tinued use. It can also be used during the day for anxiety and mus-cle pain. Although the bottle says to take up to four capsules a day,one could take up to three or four capsules two or three timeseach day, as it is very safe. If you\u2019re still not getting eight to ninehours of sleep a night, magnesium (75 to 250 mg) and calcium(600 mg) at bedtime also help sleep. It can also be used togetherwith the End Pain formula for more powerful pain relief.\nBesides these herbs, I recommend the natural sleep aids in the\nfollowing sections.\nHydroxy L-Tryptophan (5-HTP)\nTake 200 to 400 mg at night. When used for six weeks, a 300 to400 mg dose has been shown to decrease \ufb01bromyalgia pain andoften helps people to lose weight. Y our body uses 5-HTP to makeserotonin, a neurotransmitter that helps improve the quality ofsleep while also decreasing levels of substance P , your body\u2019s painmessenger. The one caution I give is that if you are taking othertreatments that increase serotonin (these include antidepressantssuch as Prozac, Saint-John\u2019s-wort, Ultram, Desyrel, and others),limit the 5-HTP to 200 mg at night. It takes six to twelve weeksto see the full effect of 5-HTP , and it is more expensive than theEFFECTIVE THERAPIES FOR CHRONIC PAIN AND RELATED PROBLEMS\n174", "other remedies. Nonetheless, it may be worthwhile in treating\nchronic pain.\nMelatonin\nThis is a hormone produced by the pineal gland. Although mela-tonin is natural and available over the counter, this does not meanthat it is without risk. My concern with any hormone is thatalthough it might be quite safe when used within the body\u2019s nor-mal range, I worry about toxicity when people take more than thebody would normally make. For most people, all it takes to restoremelatonin to normal levels is 0.5 mg. The usual dose you \ufb01nd instores, however, is 3 mg, which is six to ten times the dose thatmost people need. Except for a small subset of people, who likelyhave trouble absorbing it properly, the 0.5 mg dose is every bit aseffective for sleep as higher doses. I would use a dose higher than0.5 mg only if it clearly helps you sleep better than the lower dose.\nAdditional Safe and Inexpensive Natural\nRemedies for Pain\nMany other natural therapies can be powerfully effective in the\ntreatment of pain while also being safe and relatively inexpensive.Although we do not have space to review all of them, let\u2019s look ata few that are worth being aware of.\nTopical Gels for Muscle and Arthritis Pain\nI am a big fan of using topical therapies (see Chapter 13). Byapplying these gels directly to a targeted area of pain, you get ahigh dose to where it\u2019s needed without saturating your wholebody as you do with tablets.\nA promising product for the relief of muscle and arthritis pain\ndoes just that. Joint Gel by NF Formulas is an over-the-counternatural pain reliever that is applied directly on the skin. It containsmenthol, MSM (methylsulfonylmethane), white willow, pineNATURAL THERAPIES\n175", "bark, and botanical oils that provide relief of aches and pains. Joint\nGel also can relieve the pain of backaches, muscle sprains, andstrains. Its roll-on design delivers the gel directly onto the skinand does not leave an oily or sticky feeling. As you massage theJoint Gel over the painful joint or muscle until absorbed, you\u2019llinitially feel the menthol. The active ingredient in peppermint ismenthol, which serves as a counterirritant, stimulating the nervesthat perceive cold while simultaneously depressing those for pain.Joint Gel\u2019s aloe leaf, white willow bark, and MSM (discussed ear-lier in this chapter) are also well known for their natural pain-relieving properties. Pine bark also provides unique antioxidantsknown to play a role in the stabilization of joints and muscles.Because it contains eucalyptus, rosemary, and ginger botanicaloils, Joint Gel smells good. Y ou can use Joint Gel three to fourtimes daily.\nOral Enzymes That Treat In\ufb02ammation\nAnother wonderful treatment for in\ufb02ammation is the use of oralenzymes. For those looking for a gentle, natural, and fairly sideeffect free method of reducing in\ufb02ammation, digestive enzymescan be very helpful. When taken with food, enzymes help digestfats, proteins, and carbohydrates. When taken in between meals,digestive enzymes are absorbed into the bloodstream and areactive throughout the body, not just in the digestive tract. Thisallows them to perform other functions such as combating in\ufb02am-mation. My favorite enzyme supplements for pain and in\ufb02amma-tion are MegaZyme and Ultrazyme. They contain pancreaticenzymes (protease, amylase, and lipase), trypsin, papain, brome-lain, lysozyme, and chymotrypsin.\nEnzymes in high doses may \u201cdigest\u201d in\ufb02ammation by remov-\ning \ufb01brin from in\ufb02amed areas, thereby restoring drainage andreducing swelling. This speeds wound healing. For example, onestudy used bromelain, an enzyme derived from the stem of thepineapple plant, in 146 boxers with multiple face bruises and blackand blue marks after a boxing match. Half the boxers received theEFFECTIVE THERAPIES FOR CHRONIC PAIN AND RELATED PROBLEMS\n176", "real thing and half received placebo. All signs of bruising disap-\npeared within four days in 78 percent of the boxers receivingbromelain as compared to only 14 percent of those on a placebo.By working with your body, bromelain is able to reduce pain andin\ufb02ammation caused by numerous health problems. It can alsoimprove circulation. Bromelain helps the body make its ownenzymes to dissolve and clean up dead tissue and debris from thesite of in\ufb02ammation.\nSome physicians are under the misconception that enzymes\ntaken by mouth would simply be digested and not absorbed intothe body. This is not the case when they are taken on an emptystomach. In this situation enzymes are well absorbed, raising theirlevels in the blood.\nIn addition to decreasing in\ufb02ammation, taking enzymes may\nhelp improve function in other ways. Enzymes are necessary formany reactions to take place within your body\u2019s cells, such asassisting with rejuvenation and healing. For example, studiesshowed that taking large doses of pancreatic enzymes could helppeople with pancreatic cancer to live longer. Research by Dr.Gonzalez has shown this to be the case, and a larger scale studyusing this enzyme treatment in pancreatic cancer is now beingfunded by the National Cancer Institute. Many people have foundthat taking enzymes can markedly help decrease in\ufb02ammatorypain. For example, in one study of muscle soreness after downhillrunning, subjects were given either enzymes or a placebo. In theenzyme group, muscle soreness was much less than in the placebogroup.\nAlthough I strongly recommend that people use plant-based\nenzymes for digestion, pancreatic enzymes are better for in\ufb02am-mation. The pancreatic enzymes in Ultrazyme and MegaZymeare very high potency. The other enzymes present are also pow-erfully effective. Papain is often used to relieve the in\ufb02ammationand pain in sports injuries because athletes have discovered that itspeeds up the healing process. Papain has also been used to reducein\ufb02ammation from wisdom tooth extractions, root canals, andNATURAL THERAPIES\n177", "other oral surgeries. Unlike prescription anti-in\ufb02ammatories such\nas Prednisone (a powerful, prescription-only corticosteroid med-ication with a long list of health risks), enzymes treat in\ufb02amma-tion safely.\nT o summarize, although enzymes such as Ultrazyme and\nMegaZyme may be helpful in aiding digestion of your food whentaken with meals, I recommend that you take them on an empty\nstomach because enzymes are most effective at reducing pain andin\ufb02ammation when you take them between meals. For acute pain,enzymes can simply be taken for a few days as needed. For chronicpain, begin by taking either of them regularly (two to threetablets three times a day) between meals for six to twelve weeksto see how much it helps or until the pain and in\ufb02ammation aregone. Then you can take the enzymes as needed.\nIntravenous \u201cMyers Cocktails\u201d Nutritional Therapies\nA major problem in chronic pain is that the areas that hurt oftenhave decreased blood \ufb02ow. That means that even when you feedyour body, the areas in pain may still be starved. This is one rea-son why using the intravenous \u201cMyers cocktails\u201d nutritional ther-apies can be so effective. (More information is available atvitality101.com.) The magnesium in the IV causes the closed-down blood vessels in your muscles and brain to open, \ufb02oodingthe starved areas with nutrients and washing away toxins. Unfor-tunately, although very worthwhile, these IV treatments requirerepeat visits by a nurse and cost approximately eighty to one hun-dred dollars per dose.\nAnother way to get the blood vessels to open wide is to take a\nB vitamin called niacin (not niacinamide, which does not cause\ufb02ushing). This trick was taught to me by a brilliant chiropractorand pain specialist, Ron Huse, D.C. (phone 281-996-8100), inHouston, T exas. Take 100 to 500 mg of niacin three to four timesa day, as needed, to cause a \u201c\ufb02ushing\u201d feeling, which occurswithin approximately ten to twenty minutes. This can signi\ufb01-cantly help pain and is inexpensive. Try to keep the dose atEFFECTIVE THERAPIES FOR CHRONIC PAIN AND RELATED PROBLEMS\n178", "1,000 mg a day or less, if this is enough to cause \ufb02ushing, because\nhigher doses can sometimes (but rarely) cause liver in\ufb02ammationor unmask diabetes. This treatment also helps to lower cholesteroland is often used for this purpose. The \ufb02ushing will make you feellike you are in the Florida sun for about \ufb01fteen to forty-\ufb01ve min-utes and will often be intense. Do not worry; it is not dangerousand can help your muscles to heal while decreasing pain.\nArnica: A Powerful Homeopathic\nThe classic homeopathic for acute tissue injuries is arnica. Thiscan be highly effective and is available as a cream (Traumeel bythe Heel Company). This is a product that should be in every-body\u2019s medicine cabinet.\nTurmeric ( Curcumin Longa )\nTurmeric is an ingredient in curry powder and a relative of gin-\nger. Turmeric contains curcumin, which has been shown to be aneffective antioxidant. A study of forty-\ufb01ve days of supplementa-tion with curcumin showed marked decreases (60 percent) in thelevel of serum lipid peroxide. It is suspected that the curcuminmight therefore reduce the risk of heart disease, cancer, andin\ufb02ammatory conditions, and it may also help asthma. A reviewof several studies suggests that curcumin has anti-in\ufb02ammatory,antioxidant, anticarcinogenic, antiviral, and anti-infectious activ-ities. A common dose would be 500 to 1000 mg three times a day.\nUnfortunately, curcumin is poorly absorbed in the absence of\npiperine\u2014a compound that comes from black pepper. Piperinecan increase the absorption of many different substances and med-ications, potentially leading to toxic blood levels, however, andshould therefore be used with caution\u2014preferably with their usebeing guided by a health practitioner. When used in combinationwith boswellia, turmeric has been shown to improve bothosteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis.\nIn traditional Indian medicine, curcumin has been used to\ntreat arthritis, in\ufb02ammation, skin disease, and infections for manyNATURAL THERAPIES\n179", "centuries. It contains at least 133 active compounds, and approx-\nimately four hundred studies have been published on curcumin inthe last several years. It has also been found to be effective intreating gastric ulcers and indigestion as well as lowering serumcholesterol.\nGinger and Butterbur\nGinger acts to decrease in\ufb02ammation by inhibiting two keyenzymes (cyclooxygenase and lipooxygenase, with secondaryleukotriene inhibition). Although studies suggest some bene\ufb01twith arthritis, I consider the effect to be modest compared to theEnd Pain formula. Butterbur has been found effective in the pre-vention and treatment of migraine headaches (see Chapter 7).\nSaint-John\u2019s-Wort\nSaint-John\u2019s-wort has been found to be helpful in treating neuro-pathic pain for some people (see Chapter 4). This treatment is safeand inexpensive and helps depression, so it is worth a try\u2014espe-cially if other treatments have failed.\nMarijuana\nAlthough it may seem odd to include marijuana as an herbal, it isan herb, and it is my job to give you medical information regard-less of the politics involved. Studies suggest that the receptors thatmarijuana binds to can also decrease pain. In addition, it candecrease the suffering associated with pain, improve appetite insituations where weight loss is associated with pain (as in cancer),and is likely much safer than many other medications. The activeingredient in marijuana, THC, is available by prescription in amedication called Marinol. It is, of course, much more expensivein this form and probably not as effective, but it can be helpful.\nCapsaicin\nCapsaicin is another cream that comes from hot chili peppers. Itworks by depleting the substance P pain transmitter in nerve end-ings, interfering with the ability to send pain signals to the brain.EFFECTIVE THERAPIES FOR CHRONIC PAIN AND RELATED PROBLEMS\n180", "It can be very helpful in some situations, but I tend to avoid using\nit. I am uncomfortable with irritating the body so much that itdepletes the pain-sending chemicals. In addition, capsaicin canmake the problem worse by stimulating pain when it is \ufb01rst used,and it has to be taken regularly or the pain-sending chemicals havea chance to recover.\nAn Easy-to-Make Home Remedy\nThe following home remedy, Purple Pectin for Pain, is inexpen-sive and easy to try. It is especially geared to work for arthritis.(Please let me know how it works for you! Y ou can send me mes-sages or questions at vitality101.com.)\nPurchase Certo, the thickening agent used to make jams and\njellies, in the canning section of your local grocery. Certo con-tains pectin, a natural ingredient found in the cell walls of plants.Take one to three tablespoons of Certo in eight ounces of grapejuice one to two times daily (you can try more if you wish). If it\u2019sgoing to help, you\u2019ll likely know in seven to fourteen days. Y oucan lower the dose as you feel better.\nAs you can hopefully tell by this chapter, there are many natural\nand prescription treatments available that can be helpful. Y ou donot have to be in pain. There are other excellent natural therapiesto consider, and these are simply a sampling of my favorite natu-ral remedies.NATURAL THERAPIES\n181", "This page intentionally left blank ", "Alternative\nTreatments\nThere are many alternative therapies that can be very effective for\ntreating chronic pain. These include structural therapies such asosteopathic and chiropractic medicine and other techniques suchas hypnosis, magnets, and prolotherapy, which are described inthis chapter. In addition, Peter Marinakis, Ph.D., director of FullCircle Healing Arts in Annapolis, Maryland, provides valuableinformation on how acupuncture\u2014one of the oldest, most com-monly used medical procedures in the world\u2014can help treat pain.Many forms of body and energy work can also be powerfullyeffective in treating pain. Some, such as Rol\ufb01ng (see Chapter 3),we discussed in earlier chapters. These are simply some examplesout of dozens of different forms of body/structural/energy workthat can be powerfully effective.\nOsteopathy\nOsteopathy combines both pharmacologic/surgical medicine andan emphasis on the interrelationship between structure and func-tion in the body. It also has an appreciation of the body\u2019s ability\n183CHAPTER12\nCopyright \u00a9 200 6 by Jacob  Teitelbaum . Click here for terms of use.  ", "to heal itself. There are fourteen principles of osteopathic philos-\nophy. Here are a few of them:\n\u2022The body is a single system that includes mind and spirit as\nwell as muscles, bones, and organs.\n\u2022The body is capable of self-healing, self-regulation, and self-\nmaintenance.\n\u2022The structure of parts of the body will affect the\nfunctioning of those body parts.\n\u2022Treatment should consider the unity of the body, as well as\nthe interactions of speci\ufb01c treatments, and should harness thebody\u2019s self-regulatory ability to heal as much as possible.\nWhere in the past, osteopathy was viewed as providing more\nnatural therapies, some osteopathic physicians are becoming moreand more like M.D.s. Others are taking full advantage of thestrength of combining osteopathic manipulation and naturalremedies with prescription and surgical therapies. Pain is the mostcommon reason why patients seek osteopathic manipulation.Although this is a marked oversimpli\ufb01cation, osteopathic manip-ulative treatment (OMT) is the manual application of forces to thebody to restore maximal pain-free movement of the muscu-loskeletal system. Osteopathy looks at restrictions in movementand asymmetry of body parts. Manipulative therapy is then usedto restore balance and range of motion. A trained osteopathic canwork wonders in ways that are both safe and cost effective.\nChiropractic Medicine\nChiropractic medicine is a health-care discipline that focuses onthe relationship between the spine and body function, coordi-nated via the nervous system. Chiropractic practitioners feel thatthis relationship is critical in maintaining and restoring health.Spinal manipulation was used as early as 2700 b.c.in Chinese\nmedicine, and manipulation techniques were also used by Hip-pocrates and Galen.EFFECTIVE THERAPIES FOR CHRONIC PAIN AND RELATED PROBLEMS\n184", "A bit over one hundred years ago, David Palmer developed the\nprinciples upon which modern chiropractic is based. He believedthat abnormal nerve function was a primary cause of medical prob-lems, and he recommended adjustments to the spine to treat this.Although some physicians accepted his principles, others objectedto anybody who proposed any treatments besides their own. Thisresulted in Palmer and other early chiropractors being arrested. Thisrift between chiropractors and medical doctors persisted with theAmerican Medical Association (AMA) even saying that it wasunethical for any physician to work with a chiropractor and that anydoctor who did so could lose his or her license. This continueduntil the AMA lost an antitrust suit brought by the chiropractors.\nAs is the case in many \ufb01elds, growth occurred in many differ-\nent directions in chiropractic. The more conservative chiroprac-tors believed that poor alignment in the spine (subluxation) wasthe only problem that needed to be treated. Other chiropractorsrecognize that multiple causes could be at play, and they workalongside physicians and other practitioners.\nChiropractors are the most commonly used health practition-\ners after physicians and dentists. There are more than sixty thou-sand licensed chiropractors in the United States. Almost 80percent of chiropractic visits are for musculoskeletal c omplaints,\nand more than 40 percent are for back pain. In 1999, 11 percentof adults and more than 30 percent of patients with low back painvisited a chiropractor.\nAs chiropractic medicine has continued to grow, more than\none hundred different approaches have been developed. Most fallunder the following categories:\n\u2022Manipulation to decrease joint restriction, increase range of\nmotion, and restore vertebrae to their normal position\n\u2022Traction\n\u2022Massage/soft tissue mobilization directed at muscle, tendon,\nand other nonbony tissues\n\u2022Electrical muscle stimulation\n\u2022Diathermy\u2014using electrical currents to produce heatALTERNATIVE TREATMENTS\n185", "\u2022Ultrasound\n\u2022Ice therapy\n\u2022Heat\n\u2022Exercise-based programs\n\u2022Nutritional and metabolic support\n\u2022Energy medicine\nBecause body manipulation requires hands-on therapy, it is\nvery dif\ufb01cult to do a double-blind study. This has been used bysome traditional physicians as an excuse to ignore and put downchiropractic while conveniently forgetting that surgery faces thesame scienti\ufb01c problem. Also, because the types of chiropractictreatment vary so widely, it is dif\ufb01cult to compare the results ofdifferent studies. Nonetheless, chiropractic treatment has survivedbecause people \ufb01nd it to be helpful and often safer than usingmedications.\nHypnosis and Magnets\nAlthough a detailed discussion of these therapies is outside thescope of this book, hypnosis and magnets can both be very help-ful in the treatment of chronic pain. I have seen hypnosis decreasethe intensity of pain, change its location, decrease the sufferingassociated with pain, and change the sensation so that it feels likewarmth or softness instead of pain. When using magnets, the typeof magnet used is important because the strength and \ufb01eld con-\ufb01guration can be critical. Nikkan Company magnets seem to befairly reliable.\nProlotherapy\nProlotherapy is a series of injections of a natural solution (some-thing as simple as a sugar or salt solution; cod liver oil, known assodium morrhuate; or an herbal extract) into the area where theligaments have been weakened or damaged through injury orEFFECTIVE THERAPIES FOR CHRONIC PAIN AND RELATED PROBLEMS\n186", "strain. This stimulates proliferation of normal tissue, which helps\nthe body to repair painful areas.\nChronic musculoskeletal pain is often due to weakness of liga-\nments and tendons. The injection is given at the point where theligament or tendon connects to the bone. Many points may requireinjection. The injection causes the body to heal itself through theprocesses of controlled in\ufb02ammation and production of growthfactors.\nThe effectiveness of prolotherapy is wide ranging and includes\npain associated with the back, the neck, all joints throughout thebody, arthritis, migraine headaches, \ufb01bromyalgia, sciatica, herni-ated discs, and temporomandibular joint dysfunction (TMJ).Many chronic pain patients who did not get relief with othertreatments have improved markedly with prolotherapy.

Originating in China more than threethousand years ago, acupuncture began to become better known inthe United States in 1971, when New York Times reporter James\nReston wrote about how doctors in China had used needles to easehis abdominal pain after surgery. Research shows that acupunctureis bene\ufb01cial in treating a variety of health conditions.\nThe term acupuncture describes a family of procedures involv-\ning stimulation of anatomical points on the body by a variety ofALTERNATIVE TREATMENTS\n187", "techniques. American practices of acupuncture incorporate med-\nical traditions from China, Japan, Korea, and other countries. Theacupuncture technique that has been most studied scienti\ufb01callyinvolves penetrating the skin with thin metallic needles that aremanipulated by the hands or by electrical stimulation.\nIncreasingly, acupuncture is being used to complement con-\nventional therapies. For example, doctors may combine acupunc-ture and drugs to control surgery-related pain in their patients. Byproviding both acupuncture and conventional anesthetic drugs,doctors have found it possible to achieve a state of complete painrelief for some patients. They also have found that using acupunc-ture lowers the need for conventional painkilling drugs and thusreduces the risk of side effects for patients who take the drugs.\nCurrently, one of the main reasons Americans seek acupunc-\nture treatment is to relieve chronic pain, especially from conditionssuch as arthritis or lower back disorders, but a more complete rangeof medical conditions is listed by the World Health Organization(WHO). Some clinical studies show that acupuncture is effectivein relieving both chronic (long-lasting) and acute or sudden pain,but other research indicates that it provides no relief from chronicpain. Additional research is needed to provide de\ufb01nitive answers.\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved acu-\npuncture needles for use by licensed practitioners in 1996. TheFDA requires manufacturers of acupuncture needles to label themfor single use only. Relatively few complications from the use ofacupuncture have been reported to the FDA when one considersthe millions of people treated each year and the number of acu-puncture needles used.\nWhat the Research Says\nThe National Certi\ufb01cation Commission for Acupuncture andOriental Medicine (NCCAOM) and the Of\ufb01ce of AlternativeMedicine (OAM) have supported scienti\ufb01c research to \ufb01nd outmore about acupuncture. Researchers at the University of Mary-EFFECTIVE THERAPIES FOR CHRONIC PAIN AND RELATED PROBLEMS\n188", "land in Baltimore, with the support of OAM, conducted a ran-\ndomized controlled clinical trial and found that patients treatedwith acupuncture after dental surgery had less intense pain thanpatients who received a placebo. Scientists at the university alsofound that older people with osteoarthritis who used conventionaldrugs and acupuncture together experienced signi\ufb01cantly morepain relief than those using conventional therapy alone.\nWhat People Who Use Acupuncture Say\nThe use of acupuncture, like the use of many other complemen-tary and alternative medicine (CAM) treatments, is supported bya good deal of anecdotal evidence. Much of this evidence comesfrom people who report their own successful use of the treatment.If a treatment appears to be safe and patients report recovery fromtheir illness or condition after using it, others may decide to usethe treatment. However, scienti\ufb01c research may not support theanecdotal reports. Patient outcomes continue to be one of the bestforms of feedback to the practitioner, patient, and the health-careindustry at large. In a patient survey done by the Maryland Acu-puncture Society in January 2000, for example, 71 percent of thepatients reporting in had a \u201cvery satis\ufb01ed experience with acu-puncture and had excellent results.\u201d (See maryland-acupuncture.org for the full report.)\nLifestyle, age, physiology, and other factors combine to make\nevery person different. A treatment that works for one personmay not work for another who has the same condition. Y ou as ahealth-care consumer (especially if you have a preexisting med-ical condition) should discuss any CAM treatment, including acu-puncture, with your health-care practitioner. Do not rely on adiagnosis of disease by an acupuncture practitioner who does nothave substantial conventional medical training. If you havereceived a diagnosis from a doctor and have had little or no suc-cess using conventional medicine, however, you may wish to askyour doctor whether acupuncture might help.ALTERNATIVE TREATMENTS\n189", "How to Find a Licensed Acupuncture Practitioner\nHealth-care practitioners can be a resource for referral to practi-\ntioners of acupuncture, as more are becoming aware of this CAMtherapy. More medical doctors, including neurologists, anesthesi-ologists, and specialists in physical medicine, are becoming famil-iar with acupuncture, traditional Chinese medicine, and otherCAM therapies.\nCheck Credentials. A practitioner who is licensed and credentialed\nmay provide better care than one who is not. About forty-sevenstates have established training standards for acupuncture certi\ufb01-cation. Although proper credentials do not ensure competency,they do indicate that the practitioner has met certain standards totreat patients through the use of acupuncture.\nCheck Treatment Cost and Insurance Coverage. A practitioner\nshould inform you about the estimated number of treatmentsneeded and how much each will cost. If this information is notprovided, ask for it. Treatment may take place over a few days orfor several weeks or more. Physician acupuncturists may chargemore than nonphysician practitioners. For federal employees,physician acupuncturists are more likely to be covered. Checkwith your insurer before you start treatment as to whether acu-puncture will be covered for your condition, and if so, to whatextent. Some plans require preauthorization for acupuncture.\nCheck Treatment Procedures. Ask about the treatment procedures\nthat will be used and their likelihood of success for your condi-tion or disease. Y ou also should make certain that the practitioneruses a new set of disposable needles in a sealed package every time.The FDA requires the use of sterile, nontoxic needles that bear alabeling statement restricting their use to quali\ufb01ed practitioners.The practitioner also should swab the puncture site with alcoholor another disinfectant before inserting the needle.EFFECTIVE THERAPIES FOR CHRONIC PAIN AND RELATED PROBLEMS\n190", "During your \ufb01rst of\ufb01ce visit, the practitioner may ask you at\nlength about your health condition, lifestyle, and behavior. Thepractitioner will want to obtain a complete picture of your treat-ment needs and any behaviors that may contribute to the condi-tion. Inform the acupuncturist about all treatments or medicationsyou are taking and all medical conditions you have.\nAcupuncture needles are metallic, solid, and hair-thin. People\nexperience acupuncture differently, but most feel no or minimalpain as the needles are inserted. Some people are energized bytreatment, while others feel relaxed. Improper needle placement,movement of the patient, or a defect in the needle can cause sore-ness and pain during treatment. This is why it is important to seektreatment from a quali\ufb01ed acupuncture practitioner.\nFor a complete list of natio nal and international acupuncture\nand oriental medicine organizations see the websites aomalliance.org or who.org.

This is discussed in thechapters in Part I of this book. In most cases, medications simplygive symptomatic relief without eliminating the underlying causeof the pain. We began this section by discussing the natural ther-apies, as these remedies are likely to be safer, less expensive (unlessyou have prescription coverage), and have fewer side effects. Iwould begin treatment by going after the perpetuating factorsinvolved in pain (nutritional, hormonal, and sleep de\ufb01ciencies andunderlying infections), followed by natural remedies (discussed inChapter 11). Then use the prescription pain creams. The oral and\n193CHAPTER13\nCopyright \u00a9 200 6 by Jacob  Teitelbaum . Click here for terms of use.  ", "IV medications described in this chapter can (and should) be\nadded if needed, because it is unhealthy to be in pain. It is alsoreasonable to begin with prescription pain medications such asUltram for immediate pain relief while you\u2019re waiting for theother treatments to take effect.\nThings to Consider Before Beginning\nPain Medications\nSome medications are expensive. Most often, a generic medica-\ntion is as effective as a brand name but much less expensive. Somepatients like to get ten to thirty tablets of the brand-name med-ication \ufb01rst, so they can see what it does, and then switch to thegeneric. If there is a difference between the brand-name andgeneric medications, you would be able to tell. Unfortunately,some pharmacies are drastically marking up the cost of generics,keeping the savings for themselves. T o see what a generic med-ication really should cost, go to Costco pharmacies (or visit themonline at costco.com). They have a policy of marking up the priceto a set amount over their cost, passing the savings on to the cus-tomer. Y ou do not have to be a Costco member to use the phar-macy. If you go to one of their stores, simply tell the person at thedoor that you are going to the pharmacy.\nIn addition, most medications are much less expensive in\nhigher-dose tablets. For example, a 40 mg tablet may cost the sameas a 20 mg tablet. Y ou can save 50 percent by getting a higher-strength tablet and breaking it in half. The price of the same med-ication can also vary dramatically from pharmacy to pharmacy. Itpays to call around and check prices. An excellent mail-orderpharmacy is Consumers Discount Drug Company (phone 323-461-3606). If you can \ufb01nd a reliable Canadian pharmacy that isless expensive, you may also consider ordering from them directly.\nWhile medications are less expensive in higher-dose tablets, for\nsome medications you are likely to get more bene\ufb01t relative to theside effects at a lower dose. As you push the higher doses, you getEFFECTIVE THERAPIES FOR CHRONIC PAIN AND RELATED PROBLEMS\n194", "more side effects for less bene\ufb01t. In addition, people sometimes\nget the full bene\ufb01t without side effects at a small fraction of the\u201cstandard\u201d starting dose. Because of this, if you have a medica-tion that helps but causes side effects, try lowering the dose toeven a fraction of the starting dose. Find the dose that gives themost bene\ufb01t relative to side effects. On the other hand, somemedications do require a high dose before you see the effect.\nDoctors are often taught to give one medication, raise it to the\nmaximum tolerated dose, and then switch to another medicationif an adequate effect is not seen. They avoid combining medica-tions because of the risk of drug interactions. In treating chronicpain or insomnia, however, I have found that patients are morelikely to get excellent results with fewer side effects if they mixlow doses of several medications instead of taking a high dose ofa single medicine. As noted previously, this is because most peo-ple get more bene\ufb01t and fewer side effects at lower doses of amedication. This is especially true with medications that can besedating. Mixing medications from different categories (asdescribed later in this chapter) is more likely to help than com-bining medicines within a category. The exception is if a medica-tion greatly helps, but you cannot get an adequate dose withoutunacceptable side effects. In that situation, trying other medica-tions within the same category is a good idea.\nOther helpful things to keep in mind when taking medication\ninclude:\n\u2022Do not get pregnant while on any medication.\n\u2022Do not drive while on any medication that is sedating\nbecause you may not always be aware of the sedation.\n\u2022Some of these medications interact poorly with alcohol.\nSome people will (I think reasonably) try having a drink athome when on a steady dose of the medications to see if itcauses any reactions. Legally, I must tell you not to take anyalcohol with these medications, and check with yourphysician regarding any possible risks.PRESCRIPTION THERAPIES: WE\u2019RE WAY PAST ASPIRIN!\n195", "Why People Worry About Taking What They Need\nfor Pain\nMany people hesitate to take the amount of pain medication they\nneed because they fear side effects or addiction or because theyconsider it a sign of weakness to take medication. For those of youwho have these concerns, I would like to make several points.\nFirst, I\u2019d like to touch on an important issue regarding treat-\nment and prevention. It takes much less medication to preventpain than to make it go away once it occurs. Because of this, ifyou have chronic pain, take the medication before you expect thepain to occur, or at the \ufb01rst sign of it coming back, instead ofwaiting for the pain to be severe. Y ou\u2019ll need less pain medicineand have fewer side effects. This means that if the pain comes backevery six hours after you take the pain medicine, taking the med-icine every \ufb01ve hours\u2014even if you\u2019re not in pain when you takethe medicine\u2014may enable you to control the pain with less med-ication overall.\nThe stress of pain takes a toll on your body that is not healthy.\nPain is simply meant to tell you that there\u2019s something wrong thatyou need to pay attention to. Once you do this, the pain is nolonger healthy and should be eliminated. I suspect that you get nobonus points in heaven for having suffered through the paininstead of taking the medications needed to be comfortable. Ioften tell my patients the story about the pious man who lived inJohnstown during the Johnstown \ufb02ood. The National Guardcame into the city and told everyone to evacuate. This manrefused to leave, saying that he had faith in God and that Godwould protect him. The \ufb02oodwaters came, and soon the CoastGuard boat arrived, \ufb02oating by his second story window. Theybeseeched him to climb in the boat and be saved but he refused,once again saying that he had faith in God to protect him. Prettysoon he was up on the top of his roof, and a helicopter came byand the pilot yelled at him to get in. Once again he refused\u2014andthe man drowned. He went to heaven, and God came by. Theman was very angry at God and said, \u201cI had full faith in you andEFFECTIVE THERAPIES FOR CHRONIC PAIN AND RELATED PROBLEMS\n196", "you let me drown!\u201d God said, \u201cWhat are you talking about? I sent\nthe National Guard, the Coast Guard, and a helicopter!\u201d Themedications are like the National Guard, the Coast Guard, and thehelicopter. It\u2019s OK to use them!\nTopical Medications (Gels)\nThe use of topical delivery systems for pain medications is a majorleap forward in pain management. It allows high doses of multi-ple medications that get right to your area of pain\u2014usually withno side effects. One of the many common \u201crecipes\u201d for the paingel is the following combined in a PLO gel:\nKetamine (10 percent)\nLidocaine (15 percent)\nBaclofen (4 percent)\nAmitriptyline (2 percent)Clonidine (0.2 percent)\nKetoprofen (10 percent)\nIbuprofen (10 percent)\nRub a large pea\u2013sized amount into a silver dollar\u2013sized area at the\ncenter of a painful area three times a day. Give it two weeks towork.\nThere are over a dozen medications that can be combined in\nthese topical gels. Although they are administered by prescription,compounding pharmacists (listed in Appendix B) are usuallyhappy to guide your physician in their use.\nSome gels and creams can markedly enhance the penetration\nof medications through your skin. Medications go directly to thearea of pain in high concentrations while the rest of your body(which does not need the medication) receives very low levels.This is why side effects are usually nonexistent despite the creamsbeing highly effective. These creams need to be put together bycompounding pharmacists, who can sometimes tailor the dosingPRESCRIPTION THERAPIES: WE\u2019RE WAY PAST ASPIRIN!\n197", "to your case. Because of the time and work involved in mixing\nthese medications, most drug companies and pharmacists are notwilling to mix them.\nAlthough the creams require a prescription, many prescription\nplans will not cover them. I recommend paying for the \ufb01rst tubeof the cream yourself (approximately \ufb01fty to one hundred dollarsfor a one- to three-month supply). If it helps you and allows youto lower your dose of other pain medications, or keeps your doc-tor from having to prescribe the new very expensive medications,you\u2019ll often \ufb01nd that you can talk your insurance company intocovering the cost.\nIf you are getting bene\ufb01t from a NSAID (such as Motrin) for\ntreating a small area of pain, at least four studies have now shownthat NSAIDs can also be effective (and much safer) when used ina topical cream. In one double-blind study using a topical creamfor knee arthritis without swelling, patients rubbed a 5 percentibuprofen (Motrin) cream (containing 200 mg of ibuprofen) intothe knee three times a day. The cream started to work by thefourth day, and by the eighth day there was an average 45 per-cent decrease in pain. All patients were helped, and 40 percentconsidered the treatment to be \u201cvery good.\u201d No side effects wereseen.\nT o get an even more powerful, yet safe, effect from these\ncreams and gels, there are many medications that can be com-bined, and selecting the correct combination is an art. Some phar-macists and physicians prefer to begin with just a few medications;for example, ketoprofen (10 percent) and Flexeril (2 percent)applied three times a day locally for trigger point pain. Otherswould begin with ketoprofen (15 percent), Flexeril (3 percent),and lidocaine (5 percent). I often begin with a mixture of \ufb01ve ormore medications as this can enhance the effectiveness\u2014usuallywithout any side effects. Give the creams at least one to two weeksto work, and be willing to continue adjusting the mix until you\ufb01nd what works. The following list is just some of the medica-tions that can be added to the creams:EFFECTIVE THERAPIES FOR CHRONIC PAIN AND RELATED PROBLEMS\n198", "Ketoprofen, piroxicam, diclofenac, or ibuprofen \n(these four are NSAID anti-in\ufb02ammatories)\nNeurontin\nClonidineAmitriptyline\nCyclobenzaprine\nBaclofenKetamine (using with clonidine 0.2 percent reduces side effects)Lidocaine\nGuaifenesinCapsaicin\nCortisone and/or Sarapin\nFortunately, even though topical medications are in the \u201cbaby\nstages\u201d of development, researchers and pharmaceutical compa-nies are beginning to recognize their power. Stephen Hersh,M.D., clinical professor at George Washington University Schoolof Medicine and a member of the American Pain Society, hasfound compounded pain creams to be very helpful. For his RSD(re\ufb02ex sympathetic dystrophy) patients, he uses a combination ofgabapentin and clonidine cream, which is applied to the affectedarea two to three times a day. He notes, \u201cinstant relief [using paincreams] has not been my goal nor has it been my experience . . .unless a patient is allergic to one of the compounds in the topicalmedication, these are interventions that, unlike many in the treat-ment of chronic pain, truly do no harm.\u201d If your physician is notfamiliar with compounded pain creams, the pharmacist at CapeApothecary (T om at 410-757-3522) can help guide your physi-cian and can mail you the cream if prescribed.\nTreating with Patches\nIf you have a prescription plan, you may want to begin with thelidocaine patch. This Novocain-like patch, called Lidoderm, isapplied directly over the area of maximum pain. It can be cut toPRESCRIPTION THERAPIES: WE\u2019RE WAY PAST ASPIRIN!\n199", "\ufb01t the area, and up to four patches can be used at a time (although\nthe package insert says to use only three). It is left on for twelvehours and then removed for twelve hours each twenty-four-hourperiod, although recent reports have suggested that patches can beleft on for eighteen hours and still be safe and effective. Resultswill usually be seen within two weeks. Because the effect is local,side effects are minimal. The most common side effect is a mildskin rash from the patch. It should not be used if you have anallergy to Novocain/lidocaine.\nThe patches are most likely to be helpful if the pain is local-\nized to a moderately sized area. Even in a large area, however,patches can be used on the most uncomfortable spots. The maindownside of the patches is that they are expensive. If you haveprescription insurance, however, they will usually be covered. Isuspect that, overall, patches will be more effective than thecreams by themselves, because putting a medication \u201cunder occlu-sion\u201d (with the patch over it) drives the medication through theskin more effectively.\nOral Pain Medications\nAlthough I have organized the medications by category, it is notat all important that you understand what these categories mean.The chapters in which we discussed the different kinds of pain(neuropathic, muscular, arthritic, and so on) give the order inwhich to try the pain medications. If you are not clear on thesource or type of your pain, there are many reasonable sequencesin which to try the medications. One way to try them is in theorder of the following list. When there are several medications onthe same line, if the \ufb01rst medication helped but was not toleratedbecause of side effects, go to the next medication on the sameline. If that medication does not help signi\ufb01cantly, go to the nextline. If you get partial bene\ufb01t from a medication, continue it andadd another medication as needed to get pain free. (The medica-EFFECTIVE THERAPIES FOR CHRONIC PAIN AND RELATED PROBLEMS\n200", "tions discussed in this chapter are not a complete list of possible\nmedications, but they are the ones I have found most helpful.)\nThe main cause of side effects with many of these medications\nis raising the dose too quickly. Start with a low dose and work upslowly as is tolerated.

It\nworks on the codeine receptors and also raises serotonin and nor-epinephrine levels. Although Ultram can be taken up to 100 mgfour times a day, many people \ufb01nd they get nausea and sedation atdoses over 200 mg a day. Rarely is this a problem at a low dose,so only take 50 mg for the \ufb01rst dose. If four to six hours later nau-sea is not a problem, feel free to increase the dose to a maximumof 100 mg twice a day the \ufb01rst day. If nausea is still not a problemat this dose, you can continue to increase the dose to the maxi-mum above. The medication can also be taken on an \u201cas needed\u201dbasis.\nAspirin and NSAIDs (Nonsteroidal\nAnti-In\ufb02ammatory Drugs)\nNSAIDs block in\ufb02ammation by inhibiting hormones called\nprostaglandins (PGE). This family of hormones comes from spe-cial fats/oils in our diet (essential fatty acids). The prostaglandinthat causes in\ufb02ammation is called PGE2. This hormone is madefrom animal fats (arachadonic acid). Other oils (especially \ufb01sh oil,\ufb02axseed oil, and borage oil) make different prostaglandin hor-mones (PGE1 and PGE3) that inhibit in\ufb02ammation. In addition,these prostaglandins protect your stomach from developing ulcers.Aspirin/NSAID family medications block all of these prostaglan-dins, resulting in approximately 1 percent of chronic users peryear developing ulcers or other serious gastrointestinal complica-tions. This is why approximately \ufb01fteen thousand to twenty thou-sand Americans die each year from these medications (mostly frombleeding ulcers).\nIn fact, NSAIDs are one of the most common causes of pre-\nscription drug adverse reactions, accounting for over 107,000 hos-pitalizations and over 16,500 deaths annually in the United States.More than $2.5 billion a year is spent on the purchase of thesedrugs with another 4 billion dollars being spent to manage theirside effects. Using \ufb01sh oil and cutting down on animal fats is aEFFECTIVE THERAPIES FOR CHRONIC PAIN AND RELATED PROBLEMS\n202", "safer way to get much of these medications\u2019 bene\ufb01ts. In addition,\nwillow bark and other natural remedies (discussed in Chapter 11)have been shown to be as effective and are much safer thanNSAIDs.\nNSAIDs are rarely bene\ufb01cial in \ufb01bromyalgia (a muscle pain\ndisorder). In one study, NSAIDs were no more effective than aplacebo. There are many different categories of NSAIDs. As yourphysician is likely familiar with this family of medications, and asI am not thrilled with their being used for long-term treatmentbecause of side effects, I\u2019m not going to talk about them at greatdepth. However, let\u2019s review the key points.\nIt is important to be aware that NSAIDs can belong to differ-\nent families or chemical structures (as seen in Table 13.1), andtherefore all NSAIDs do not behave the same. If you do not getbetter with an NSAID in one family, do not try another in thesame family. Instead go to one in a different family.\nAs you can see in Table 13.1, you may not respond to ibupro-\nfen, but may respond well to Voltaren. The important thing is thatif you try ibuprofen, don\u2019t try naproxen next because you\u2019re justadding a chemically similar agent. If you use one type of NSAIDPRESCRIPTION THERAPIES: WE\u2019RE WAY PAST ASPIRIN!\n203Family/Chemical Structure NSAID\nPropionic Ibuprofen (Motrin and Advil)\nNaproxen (Naprosyn and Aleve)\nOxaprozin (Daypro) \nKetoprofen\nAcetic Diclofenac (Voltaren)\nIndomethacin (Indocin)\nTolmetin \nSulindac (Clinoral)\nSalicylic (carboxylic) Aspirin \nDi\ufb02unisal (Dolobid)\nAnthranilic (enolic) Piroxicam (Feldene)Pyrrolopyrroles Etodolac \nKetorolac (Toradol)TABLE 13.1 Families of NSAIDs", "and it does not work, change to another family altogether if you\u2019re\ngoing to try another NSAID. This applies not just to effectiveness,but also to tolerability.\nI recommend beginning with Motrin (Advil, ibuprofen) or\nDaypro, followed by Voltaren (which seems to be easier on thestomach). Although NSAIDs can be very good for in\ufb02ammatorypain, they usually work poorly for muscle/myofascial pain. Basedon its mechanism of action, one would expect that Celebrexwould not work for muscle pain either. Nonetheless, my patientshave taught me that this medication can be highly effective formuscle pain that is not helped by NSAIDs. We still have a lot tolearn.\nSelective COX-2 Inhibitors\nThese medications inhibit certain in\ufb02ammatory pathways morespeci\ufb01cally than the NSAIDs, inhibiting those COX enzymesinvolved in in\ufb02ammation, while not affecting those prostaglandinsthat protect the stomach lining. Because of this, they\u2019re consid-ered by some to be less likely to cause stomach bleeding and irri-tation. In my experience, patients have found Celebrex (100 to200 mg one to two times a day) to be far more effective for\ufb01bromyalgia and muscle pain than the NSAIDs, which only seemto help in 10 to 15 percent of patients. They are also easier on thestomach.\nIn one study conducted over a period of twelve weeks, stom-\nach ulcers were seen in 7 percent of patients given a placebo,approximately 7 percent of patients on a COX-2 medication, and29 percent of patients on Motrin (800 mg three times a day).\nUnfortunately, recent research suggests that this family of\nmedications may markedly increase the risk of heart attacks andstrokes, and because of this Vioxx and Bextra have been removedfrom the market (although in a controversial way, Vioxx was ini-tially allowed back on). In addition, they may result in high bloodpressure. Researchers at the Arthritis Research Center Founda-EFFECTIVE THERAPIES FOR CHRONIC PAIN AND RELATED PROBLEMS\n204", "tion in Wichita, Kansas, examined data on 8,538 patients who\nwere taking rofecoxib (Vioxx), celecoxib (Celebrex), or otherNSAIDs. They determined that taking Vioxx also increased therisk of lower leg swelling (a symptom often linked to hyperten-sion and other cardiac diseases) by 23 percent and increased bloodpressure by 21 percent compared to other NSAID use. Patientswho are allergic to sulfa antibiotics cannot take Celebrex.\nAcetaminophen/Tylenol\nFor many people, acetaminophen can be a safe and effective painmedication. Simply be aware that chronic use at too high a dosecan cause liver and sometimes kidney problems. Do not take morethan 4,000 mg a day, and for chronic use it is best to stay under2,000 to 3,000 mg daily. If you are taking more than 1,000 mg aday on a regular basis, you are probably depleting a critical antiox-idant called glutathione. This can result in many other problems.Taking the Energy Revitalization System vitamin powder canhelp restore your glutathione levels by supplying vitamin C, NAC(N-acetyl-cysteine), and other key amino acids. Unfortunatelytaking glutathione itself by mouth is not effective as it getsdigested. If you are taking over 1,500 mg of acetaminophen a dayon a regular basis, take an extra 500 to 650 mg of NAC each dayalong with the vitamin powder.\nA common problem is that people often take several different\nmedications that contain acetaminophen. In addition to Tylenol,it can also be found in many prescription and over-the-countercold, sleep, pain (including most narcotics), and other remedies.Please check to see how much acetaminophen is in each medica-tion you are taking so that you can be sure that you\u2019re not gettingtoxic amounts. This has become a signi\ufb01cant concern with analarming number of patients suffering from serious side effectsassociated with accidental overdosing of acetaminophen. Thisresults in over \ufb01fty-six thousand hospital emergency room visitsand one hundred deaths a year according to the FDA. This risk isPRESCRIPTION THERAPIES: WE\u2019RE WAY PAST ASPIRIN!\n205", "especially alarming when you realize that acetaminophen is only\nmodestly superior to a placebo for treating arthritis. At higherdoses of acetaminophen (over 2,000 mg a day), the risk of gas-trointestinal bleeding increases 3.6 fold. At doses of over3,600 mg, the risk was equivalent to that of aspirin and NSAIDs.In addition, kidney failure and death from liver failure was morecommon in people taking acetaminophen for pain than in thosewho overdosed.\nAlthough I consider acetaminophen to be an excellent drug for\nshort-term or intermittent use, especially at doses under 2,000 mga day, other medications may be safer for long-term and chronicuse\u2014and will likely be more effective.\nMuscle Relaxants\nSome muscle relaxants work directly on the brain, causing lessmuscle weakness. One excellent medication is Skelaxin (800 mgthree to four times a day), which is low in side effects. In somepeople it works wonderfully, and in others it does nothing. Formuscle pain, give Skelaxin a few weeks to see the effect. This is amedication I use frequently because it is not sedating.\nOther medications work directly on the muscles to cause\nrelaxation instead of working at the level of brain or nerve func-tion. Because of this, they are also not likely to cause sedation orconfusion, but they are more likely to cause muscle weakness.\nOne such medication is dantrolene (Dantrium), which works\ndirectly on the muscle causing it to relax. The usual dose is 25 to100 mg given three to four times daily. The main problem withusing this medication is that it can cause liver damage in about1 percent of patients who use it, and liver blood tests may need tobe monitored.\nGABA-Augmenting Medications\nGABA is a chemical compound in the brain that tends to settledown excess stimulation. Historically, GABA-augmenting med-ications have been used to treat muscle spasm. The medicationEFFECTIVE THERAPIES FOR CHRONIC PAIN AND RELATED PROBLEMS\n206", "Baclofen has been used for almost forty years and has been found\nto be safe and effective and is considered a key \ufb01rst-line therapyfor spasticity.\nUnlike some medications, Baclofen can be used over a wide\nrange of dosing. Although a common dose is 10 to 20 mg two tofour times a day, doses as low as 5 mg or as high as 200 mg a daycan be used. Its main limiting side effects are sedation and, athigher doses, muscle weakness. In addition, withdrawal spasmsand other side effects can be seen if the medication is stoppedabruptly. Because of this, if you have been on Baclofen for anextended time and you want to stop, you should be weaned offthe medication slowly. This medication may also be helpful forpost-traumatic stress disorder. In addition, I found that newermedications that affect GABA are more effective than Baclofenand work on many different kinds of pain\nNeurontin (Gabapentin). This seizure medication can help a wide\nvariety of pain patients. Although Neurontin is related to theGABA neurotransmitters, how it works is unclear. It does stimu-late GABA receptors in ways that are different from Baclofen.Although it causes sedation and other neurologic side effects insome patients, overall it is very safe and well-tolerated. It has beenproven to be effective in both diabetic neuropathy and posther-petic neuralgia (shingles pain).\nBegin with 300 mg at bedtime. Patients who are very sensitive\nto medications should begin with only 100 mg. If tolerated, youcan increase the dose to 600 mg the second night and 900 mg thethird night. Y ou can then increase the Neurontin dose by 300 mgonce or twice weekly (or more quickly if side effects are not aproblem). When taking over 900 mg a day, divide the totalamount into three daily doses. If there is no effect at 2,400 mg aday, the medication is not likely to help. If you have been on themedication for more than a few months, it should be tapered offover several weeks. Although it is rare, withdrawal can occur ifthis medication is stopped suddenly. If only partial relief is seen atPRESCRIPTION THERAPIES: WE\u2019RE WAY PAST ASPIRIN!\n207", "2,400 mg a day, the dose can be raised as high as 4,800 mg or\nmore daily. The medication may not be absorbed as effectively iftaken within a few hours of magnesium (or aluminum antacids).Therefore, if it\u2019s convenient, take the vitamin powder, whichcontains magnesium, a few hours away from the Neurontin dose.\nGabitril. As noted in Chapter 4, Gabitril (tiagabine) is an anti-\nseizure medication that has also been shown to increase GABA byinhibiting reuptake (the same way that Prozac raises serotonin).Although not FDA approved for sleep, studies have found that, inaddition to decreasing pain, the medication can also improve deepsleep. The main side effects are sedation, dizziness, irritability, andgastric upset. It is best to take Gabitril with food. The most com-mon effective dose of Gabitril is 16 mg a day (ranging from 5 to24 mg a day).\nIn one study, Gabitril was given at a dose of 2 mg twice a day\nand increased by up to 4 mg daily each week to a maximum of24 mg a day. Other patients received Neurontin, beginning at100 mg twice daily and increasing by 300 mg a day each week toa maximum of 2,400 mg a day. The ninety-one patients partici-pating all had chronic pain of different types. Gabitril decreasedpain by approximately 30 percent and decreased sleep problemsby approximately 40 percent. Similar albeit smaller improvementswere seen with Neurontin. Especially important is the \ufb01ndingthat the amount of time spent in deep, restorative sleep wasincreased. Five mg at bedtime is a good sleep dose.\nLyrica (Pregabalin). This drug is related to Neurontin and is the\n\ufb01rst drug that may eventually have FDA approval for use in\ufb01bromyalgia, so insurers will more likely pay for it. It may alsobe approved for epilepsy, neuropathic pain, and anxiety. A mul-ticenter drug study showed that pregabalin was helpful with bothcontrolling pain and increasing deep sleep in patients with \ufb01bro-myalgia. It also reduced restless leg syndrome, a very commonEFFECTIVE THERAPIES FOR CHRONIC PAIN AND RELATED PROBLEMS\n208", "problem in \ufb01bromyalgia. The main side effects are dizziness and\ndrowsiness, which tend to decrease over time. Initial experiencewith it has been very encouraging. The dosing range is 50 to150 mg three times a day. A dose of 100 mg three times a daymay be as effective as the higher dose.\nTopamax (Topiramate). This is another antiseizure medication that\ncan be very helpful for pain. Although I use T opamax infre-quently, this is a medication that I have seen work wonderfully inpatients for whom numerous other treatments have failed, and itsometimes starts working in less than one week. Begin with 25 to50 mg daily and increase by 25 to 50 mg a week until you get thedesired effect. This medication is usually given twice a day at atotal daily dose of 50 to 100 mg per day for migraines and 200 to300 mg a day for nerve pain, although lower doses can be effec-tive. If you get side effects, decrease the dose and perhaps laterincrease it more slowly until you get the desired effect.\nThe most common side effects are diarrhea (11 percent), loss\nof appetite (11 percent), sedation (10 percent), and nausea (10 per-cent). The side effects often go away after two to three months.Along with pain relief, T opamax also has the bene\ufb01t of causingweight loss. Besides sedation, its most worrisome, albeit unusual,side effect is that it can make your body very acidic\u2014to the pointwhere it is dangerous. Because of this, it is reasonable to check ablood bicarbonate level every so often (especially if you startdeveloping symptoms such as fatigue) and make sure that the levelis over 17.\nAntidepressants\nAntidepressants can be very helpful in alleviating pain even if theperson is not depressed. Do not presume that your pain specialistthinks that you have a psychological problem if you\u2019re offered anantidepressant for pain. The following types of antidepressantshave been found useful in alleviating pain.PRESCRIPTION THERAPIES: WE\u2019RE WAY PAST ASPIRIN!\n209", "Tricyclic Antidepressants. These medications (including Elavil/\namitriptyline, doxepin, and others) can be dramatically bene\ufb01cial,even at very low doses, for neuropathic pain. They also improvethe sleep problems caused by the pain. Where the antidepressantdose of Elavil is approximately 200 to 250 mg a day, the neuro-pathic dose is usually about 10 to 50 mg at bedtime. In additionto neuropathic pain, tricyclic antidepressants have also been foundto be effective for \ufb01bromyalgia. Tricyclics have also been foundto be effective for headaches and vulvodynia/pelvic pain syn-dromes. They also can markedly enhance the effect of narcoticpain medications.\nTheir main side effects include dry mouth, sedation, weight\ngain, constipation, low blood pressure, and palpitations. In addi-tion, these medications can cause a worsening of glaucoma, uri-nary retention, and restless leg syndrome.\nDesipramine (Norpramin), 25 to 150 mg at bedtime, or nor-\ntriptyline (Pamelor), 10 to 25 mg at bedtime, cause less sedationand fewer side effects than Elavil and may be as effective. If seda-tion is still a problem, consider switching to doxepin (10 to 40 mgat bedtime).\nFlexeril (Cyclobenzaprine). While Flexeril is a muscle relaxant, it\nis in the tricyclic family. Unlike Elavil, which is more effective fornerve pain, Flexeril is mostly effective for muscle pain and sleepproblems. In my experience, it is better tolerated than Elavil andis worth trying even if the other tricyclics were ineffective orpoorly tolerated. In one \ufb01bromyalgia study, Flexeril was far moreeffective than a placebo.\nFlexeril can be sedating, and many people choose only to take\nit at night, using 10 to 20 mg at bedtime. It can also be taken at adose of 5 to 10 mg three times a day instead. Recent studies havefound, however, that a 5 mg dose is almost as effective as 10 mgwith much less drowsiness. In one study of patients with musclespasm, most patients experienced moderate to c omplete symptom\nrelief within forty-eight hours of starting Flexeril (5 mg threeEFFECTIVE THERAPIES FOR CHRONIC PAIN AND RELATED PROBLEMS\n210", "times a day). Only 29 percent were sedated at the lower dose, and\nin most cases sedation was mild, with only 2 percent of patientsreporting severe sedation. As an aside, the generic form is muchless expensive. If it is not available in the 5 mg generic size, sim-ply get the 10 mg tablet and break it in half.\nSSRI Antidepressants. SSRIs include medications such as Prozac,\nEffexor, and Celexa and can also be highly effective for pain.These medications raise serotonin, which lowers levels of sub-stance P , a major pain messenger. Substance P levels can beincreased by 300 percent in the brains of patients with \ufb01bromyal-gia, and it is elevated in other pain states as well. One-third of\ufb01bromyalgia patients \ufb01nd that SSRIs help their pain signi\ufb01cantly.Interestingly, people may feel horrible with one SSRI and won-derful with another, so it is worth trying several sequentially to\ufb01nd one that \u201c\ufb01ts.\u201d\nBeing off-patent, Prozac has the bene\ufb01t of being less expensive.\nCelexa causes fewer side effects than other antidepressants. In myexperience however, Effexor is the most effective antidepressantfor decreasing the pain and other symptoms of \ufb01bromyalgiapatients, so it is a reasonable medication to try \ufb01rst. This may occurbecause the medication raises both serotonin and norepineph-rine\u2014an excellent combination in pain management. Effexor canbe helpful in neuropathic pain and headache as well, especially inpatients with associated depression and/or anxiety.\nDr. Argo, a pain specialist at the pain management center at\nColumbia Rose Medical Center, Denver, has found that Paxil canbe very helpful for re\ufb02ex sympathetic dystrophy where otherSSRIs are not.\nA new family of antidepressant medications is promising.\nCymbalta (duloxetine) is a norepinephrine and serotonin reuptakeinhibitor. At lower doses (20 to 60 mg a day), it has fewer sideeffects and does not cause weight gain.\nIf sleep is a problem, consider adding trazodone (Desyrel) at\nbedtime. This novel antidepressant is very good for sleep (use aPRESCRIPTION THERAPIES: WE\u2019RE WAY PAST ASPIRIN!\n211", "low dose such as 25 to 75 mg at bedtime) and anxiety. As noted\nin previous chapters, good sleep is critical for pain relief!\nOne of the most troublesome side effects of the Prozac family\n(SSRI) antidepressants is sexual dysfunction (discussed in moredetail in Chapter 14). This especially manifests as delayed orgasm.As one of my female patients said, \u201cAn orgasm delayed is anorgasm lost.\u201d Many treatments are available to help with this typeof sexual dysfunction. I recommend beginning with the herbginkgo biloba, 120 mg two times daily. This higher dose is nec-essary to counteract the loss of libido from antidepressants, as theusual dose (60 mg twice daily) was not effective in a recent study.It takes six weeks to see the effect on the libido.\nMedications that can be helpful for antidepressant-induced sex-\nual dysfunction include cyproheptadine (Periactin), 2 to 16 mgdaily, average dose 8 mg. It can be taken one to two hours beforeintercourse on an \u201cas needed\u201d basis, or it can be taken every day.Its main side effect is sedation, and it will sometimes reverse theeffectiveness of the antidepressant, so taking it on an \u201cas needed\u201dbasis may be the best approach. BuSpar (buspirone), a medicationused to treat anxiety, has also been shown to help. It is best takenevery day when used for sexual dysfunction. Stimulants such asDexedrine and Ritalin, 5 to 25 mg daily, are also effective. Othermedications that raise dopamine, such as amantadine (Symmetrel),100 mg twice daily, or the antidepressant Wellbutrin, have alsobeen shown to be effective. Although most of the studies on thesemedications were conducted in a small number of patients (exceptfor ginkgo biloba, which was a larger trial), there are plenty ofoptions available so that you can have your Prozac and your sexlife too!\nAlpha-2-Adrenergic Agonists (Enhancers)\nZana\ufb02ex (tizanidine) and Catapres are two key medications in thecategory of alpha-2-adrenergic enhancers. The former appears tobe more effective for pain management and has fewer side effects.Like GABA agents, these medications tend to settle things down.EFFECTIVE THERAPIES FOR CHRONIC PAIN AND RELATED PROBLEMS\n212", "Unlike Baclofen, however, Catapres has the bene\ufb01t of not caus-\ning muscle weakness.\nThe main side effect of Zana\ufb02ex is sedation, but this can also\nbe a bene\ufb01t. In most patients, I recommend that they take 2 to8 mg at bedtime. This helps sleep and also helps both nighttimeand next-day pain. Dry mouth is sometimes seen with this med-ication. If sedation is not a problem, Zana\ufb02ex can be taken threeto four times a day as needed, with a maximum dose of 36 mg aday. Most patients \ufb01nd that 4 mg at bedtime works just \ufb01ne. IfZana\ufb02ex is too expensive, try Catapres instead.\nNMDA Receptor Antagonists\nNMDA receptors are highly involved in triggering pain and cancause irritation that results in the persistence of pain. Because ofthis, medications that settle down this NMDA irritation can bevery helpful.\nKetamine. Ketamine is a general anesthetic that has traditionally\nbeen given intravenously. Because ketamine works by blocking acritical pain mechanism (the NMDA receptor) that is missed byother therapies, it holds promise in the treatment of refractorypain, especially neuropathic, myofascial, posta mputation, and\nre\ufb02ex sympathetic dystrophy. Ketamine has been used clinicallyfor over twenty-\ufb01ve years for anesthesia. In addition, pain reliefoften persists long after the medication has worn off. This sug-gests that ketamine may actually be breaking the pain cycle (whenthe pain itself triggers more pain) in some conditions.\nIn the later section on IV therapies, I brie\ufb02y discuss the role of\nIV ketamine, an anesthetic that can cause hallucinations and a feel-ing of unreality, limiting its use on a regular basis. Nonetheless, itcan be very helpful in certain refractory cases\u2014especially withnerve/neuropathic pain and re\ufb02ex sympathetic dystrophy. Sideeffects tend to decrease with continued use and can be decreasedby adding other medications such as Haldol or midazolam (or byadding 0.2 percent Catapres to ketamine creams when needed).PRESCRIPTION THERAPIES: WE\u2019RE WAY PAST ASPIRIN!\n213", "Because of IV and oral ketamine\u2019s psychological side effects,\nthese forms of ketamine are best prescribed by those physicianswho have more experience with pain management. Ketamine canbe very helpful (and usually side effect free) in gel form applied tothe painful area, taking one to two weeks to see the effect.\nKlonopin (Clonazepam). Klonopin is in the Valium family, but I\n\ufb01nd it to be much more effective and safer than Valium for a num-ber of reasons. Klonopin acts as an NMDA receptor antagonist. Italso acts as a muscle relaxant and can be very helpful for sleep(unlike Valium, which actually interferes with restorative sleep,keeping people in light stage 2 sleep). However, like Valium,Klonopin can be addictive. In my experience, addiction has beenrare at doses under 1.5 mg a day. Its main side effect is sedation,so I mostly have patients take it at nighttime. It can also be veryhelpful for anxiety and restless leg syndrome (where your legs arerhythmically moving all night\u2014and your sleep is not very restfulif you\u2019re running a marathon all night).\nPatients often come to my of\ufb01ce who have been on benzodi-\nazepines (Valium family medications) for many years and are oftenaddicted. If the medication is not interfering with their life and ishelping their symptoms, I do not consider getting them off themedication to be a high priority. For those who want to wean offValium family medications, it must be done under a physician\u2019ssupervision as withdrawal is common. Neurontin (200 mg threetimes a day) can help make it easier to wean off Valium and otherrelated medications.\nDextromethorphan. Dextromethorphan is not usually very effec-\ntive on its own in treating pain, but when added to narcotics ithelps to keep the narcotics effective. Only a small percentage of\ufb01bromyalgia patients (less than 18 percent), however, received sig-ni\ufb01cant bene\ufb01t from the dextromethorphan (a 51 percentdecrease in pain at an average dose of 50 mg, three times a day).EFFECTIVE THERAPIES FOR CHRONIC PAIN AND RELATED PROBLEMS\n214", "For most patients, the side effects\u2014dizziness, mental fog, nausea,\nand fatigue\u2014at these doses are prohibitive. But if you have per-sistent pain, dextromethorphan is worth trying by starting at 25to 50 mg a day and slowly increasing the dose as tolerated.Although this medication is available over the counter, it is usu-ally found mixed with other medications. It can be obtained inpure form from compounding pharmacists.\nSodium Channel Blockers\nExcept for lidocaine, this family of medications tends to be highin side effects. Because of this, I usually use other medications\ufb01rst. Nonetheless, in some patients these medications can be agodsend. (Lidocaine is discussed in the later section on IV painmedications.)\nDilantin (Phenytoin). Dilantin is one of the oldest seizure medica-\ntions and is underused. I was amazed about twenty years agowhen I received a book on the uses of Dilantin in the mail. A mil-lionaire was given Dilantin for a severe chronic problem withalmost miraculous results. He researched the little-publicized ben-e\ufb01ts of Dilantin use, put them in a book, and sent a free copy ofthe book to every physician in the country. Since he derived nobene\ufb01t except helping others from this expensive action, I wasimpressed enough to explore the use of this medication further.Although it is old and fairly inexpensive, Dilantin can be veryhelpful. It is useful for nerve pain of several types, including timeswhen cancer is in\ufb01ltrating into nerve bundles. The recommendeddose is 300 to 400 mg daily.\nDilantin does have more side effects than most of the other\nmedications we\u2019ve discussed, and, therefore, I rarely use it as a\ufb01rst-line treatment, saving it for cases that do not respond to othertherapies.\nDilantin can also cause birth defects if one gets pregnant while\ntaking it. Otherwise, its main side effects include dizziness, seda-PRESCRIPTION THERAPIES: WE\u2019RE WAY PAST ASPIRIN!\n215", "tion, and nausea. It can also cause unwanted hair growth (some-\ntimes on the ears in females) and overgrowth of gum tissue. (Thelatter side effect can actually be bene\ufb01cial in those who havereceding gums. Dilantin can be given as a topical cream appliedto the gums for this purpose.)\nTegretol (Carbamazepine). This antiseizure medication is most\noften used for trigeminal neuralgia, peripheral neuropathy, andpostherpetic neuralgia (post shingles pain). The main side effectsinclude sedation, tremor, and dif\ufb01culty with speech. A drop inwhite blood cell count can occur in 10 percent of patients, butthis sometimes resolves after four months. If blood counts go toolow or there is lymph node enlargement, stop the medication.This medication can also cause birth defects if one gets pregnantwhile taking it. It has many more side effects than most of theothers that I use, and therefore I rarely use it.\nAdditional Oral Medications\nLamictal (lamotrigine) can also be effective for many kinds ofpain, including nerve pain from AIDS and central brain pain fromstrokes. In early studies where lower doses of 200 mg a day or lesswere used, the effects were marginal. Doses of 200 to 400 mg aday, divided through the day, are more effective for some kinds ofpain. Y ou can start with a low dose and increase by 25 mg a weekto decrease the probability of side effects. The most worrisomeside effect is a rare rash (called Stevens-Johnson syndrome), whichcan be fatal. If you develop a rash, stop the medication immedi-ately and let your doctor know. The vast majority of the time itwill not be this dangerous type of rash, but better safe than sorry.\nKeppra (levetiracetam) is another new antiseizure medication\nthat we are just starting to explore. It has been effective whenother treatments have not helped. The recommended dose is 500to 1,500 mg twice daily.\nTrileptal (oxcarbazepine) is a cousin to the medication T egre-\ntol, and both of these medications are helpful for trigeminal neu-EFFECTIVE THERAPIES FOR CHRONIC PAIN AND RELATED PROBLEMS\n216", "ralgia. The dose is 150 mg two times a day, although one can go\nas high as 600 mg two times a day. The side effects (sedation,blurred vision) decrease after the initial three weeks of treatment.\nLithium is a natural mineral that is available by prescription for\nthe treatment of bipolar disorder (manic-depressive illness). It hasmany other properties including being antiviral. Interestingly, sev-eral case reports have noted that debilitating chronic pain that hasbeen refractory to other treatments will sometimes improve dra-matically with lithium. Sometimes this can be achieved withdoses as low as 300 mg one to two times daily.\nWhen to Consider Narcotics\nSome physicians consider narcotics to be a pain reliever of lastresort\u2014only to be used with terminally ill cancer patients. Theuse of narcotics for chronic pain continues to be controversial andhas become highly politicized. Fortunately, the vast majority ofchronic pain cases can now be treated effectively without nar-cotics. Nonetheless, there are cases in which they are necessary.Sometimes the toxicity of the pain dramatically outweighs thetoxicity of the medication.\nIf narcotic side effects are problematic, ask your doctor to use\nthe other pain medications we discuss in the book as well so youcan \ufb01nd a combination that is more comfortable. (Using fentanylpatches can be very helpful because they give steady release ofpain medication, are powerful, and can be taken even if nausea orconfusion is present.)\nData suggest that longer-acting narcotics are less likely to cause\naddictive behavior than short-acting narcotics. In addition, as pre-viously mentioned, for severe chronic pain, giving the medicationon a regular basis (two to three times a day) to prevent pain ismore effective than waiting for the pain to occur before takingthe medication\u2014with the result that less medication is needed.\nWhen treating with narcotics, it is helpful to be aware that dif-\nferent narcotics can work on several different types of opioidPRESCRIPTION THERAPIES: WE\u2019RE WAY PAST ASPIRIN!\n217", "receptors. This means that combining different narcotics may\nresult in their having a synergistic effect (a lower dose of two dif-ferent types such as oxycodone and morphine may work muchbetter than a higher dose of one of them). In addition, if one isdeveloping resistance to one narcotic, rotating to others may resultin improved effectiveness. Some narcotics also have multipleeffects. For example, methadone affects the opioids receptorswhile also blocking NMDA receptors.\nDealing with the Side Effects\nThe main side effects of narcotics are constipation and sedation.The magnesium in the vitamin powder can be very helpful for theconstipation, and other treatments can also help. I recommendusing the following list as many other constipation treatments canbe addictive. Adjust as needed for one soft bowel movement a day.\n\u2022Increase water, \ufb01ber (for example, eat one bowl of whole\ngrain cereal in the morning), and magnesium intake.\n\u2022Try other natural over-the-counter treatments for\nconstipation that include high-dose vitamin C (see thearticle \u201cVitamin C Flush\u201d under \u201cUseful Articles\u201d atvitality101.com), prunes, and/or prune juice. Although weoften forget about prunes, they have been used for centuriesand can be quite helpful.\n\u2022Prescription treatments can also help and include MiraLax\u2014\ntake one heaping tablespoon a day in eight ounces of water;sorbitol (70 percent)\u2014take one to three teaspoons threetimes a day as needed; and lactulose liquid as needed.\nA new medication called Provigil can be very helpful for\nnarcotic-induced fatigue. Aricept (donepezil), a medication forAlzheimer\u2019s disease that increases acetylcholine levels, has alsobeen found to be helpful for this problem.\nI would note that there is also a small subset (approximately 2\nto 5 percent) of \ufb01bromyalgia patients who experience dramaticclearing of exhaustion and fatigue (associated with their pain)EFFECTIVE THERAPIES FOR CHRONIC PAIN AND RELATED PROBLEMS\n218", "with narcotic pain medications. They state (and I\u2019ve heard this\nstatement many times) that they \u201cfeel like healthy normal humanbeings\u201d when they are taking the narcotic medication. AlthoughI have not yet \ufb01gured out the biochemistry of this effect, in thefuture I hope to have nonnarcotic alternatives that will give thesame bene\ufb01t.\nAnother important side effect of using opioids in men is that\nthe narcotics will routinely drop the patients\u2019 testosterone levels(often by elevating a hormone called prolactin), resulting in lossof libido and sometimes dif\ufb01culty with erections. Because of this,it is reasonable to have a patient\u2019s testosterone level checked beforebeginning chronic opioids. If symptoms of low testosteroneoccur, and the testosterone level has decreased on treatment withopioids, it is reasonable to treat with natural testosterone cream orAndroGel as well.\nLong-Acting Narcotic Pain Medications\nThere are a number of different long-acting narcotic pain med-ications. These include methadone (Dolophine), sustained-releasemorphine (such as MS Contin), and sustained-release oxycodone(OxyContin), which may be preferable to short-acting combina-tions of codeine with acetaminophen, oxycodone, or hydroco-done. The longer-acting medications maintain a steady blood levelso there is less of a euphoric effect (and therefore less drug crav-ing) and more consistent relief of pain. In addition, not combin-ing the medication with acetaminophen allows one to safely usehigher doses, as needed. Using more than 3,000 to 4,000 mg ofacetaminophen (Tylenol) daily can be toxic to the liver andimmune system (as explained previously).\nMethadone is one of the oldest narcotics and has many bene-\n\ufb01ts. It is inexpensive, long-acting, effective, and usually well-tolerated. It also may have some activity as an NMDA receptorantagonist, making the medication useful in neuropathic pain aswell. Unfortunately, I do not use methadone in my practicedespite its being an excellent pain medication. The regulatory andbureaucratic risks and hassles associated with its use are simplyPRESCRIPTION THERAPIES: WE\u2019RE WAY PAST ASPIRIN!\n219", "too great. This has also been the experience of many other pain\nspecialists.\nFortunately, there are other longer-acting narcotics available.\nOne of the best known is OxyContin (timed-release oxycodone),which can be very safe and effective when used orally as directed.Sadly, it can be illegally diverted and used illicitly. Therefore, ithas also become dangerous for physicians to prescribe Oxycontin,even appropriately, because the federal government will some-times put a physician in jail for doing so. OxyContin also has beenassociated with vitamin B\n2(ribo\ufb02avin) de\ufb01ciency, which will\nsometimes cause the corners of the mouth to crack. This is calledangular stomatitis ,cheilitis , or perleche . In one study of twenty-two\npatients receiving OxyContin, twenty of them were found tohave this problem. High-dose vitamin B\n2(present in the Energy\nRevitalization System) eliminated the problem in almost allpatients within a few days.\nAn alternative is the use of timed-release morphine. This can\nbe given every twelve hours, although in some patients it needs tobe given three times a day. Another alternative is non\u2013timed-release oxycodone (Percocet and Roxicet), which is stronger andless sedating than morphine. Although not as safe (they are moreaddictive) as the timed-release form (Oxycontin), they\u2019re stillhighly effective, and physicians are less likely to be arrested or losetheir licenses for prescribing them. Again, be aware that many ofthese medications are combined with acetaminophen (Tylenol)and that many pain patients are getting acetaminophen from manysources. It is worth repeating that chronic use of more than 3,000to 4,000 mg of acetaminophen a day can cause severe liver dam-age. It is very important to check everything that you are takingto make sure that you do not take more than this amount of acet-aminophen daily.\nNarcotics and Addiction\nExperience and the scienti\ufb01c literature have shown that opioidsare very unlikely to cause addiction when used properly for treat-EFFECTIVE THERAPIES FOR CHRONIC PAIN AND RELATED PROBLEMS\n220", "PRESCRIPTION THERAPIES: WE\u2019RE WAY PAST ASPIRIN!\nThe medical components found in marijuana (discussed in Chapter\n11) can be helpful in a number of painful conditions, especially\nwhen anxiety and/or loss of appetite (for example due to cancer)\nare also problematic. In most studies, pharmaceutical fractions arestudied (such as THC in the medication Marinol) instead of whole\nmarijuana. Studies have found marijuana to be effective for cancer,\nneuropathic, and spasticity pain. Unfortunately, as discussed earlier,the more expensive synthetic pharmaceutical forms of marijuanamay not be as effective as smoking marijuana.\nCurrent evidence suggests that there are brain receptors for\ncannabis just as there are receptors for opioids, and that migraineheadaches, \ufb01bromyalgia, and irritable bowel syndrome may all\ndisplay an underlying de\ufb01ciency of the body\u2019s own \u201ccannabis-like\u201d\nchemical production. Especially in cases where the brain has beensensitized to pain (called a central sensitization state with\nsecondary hyperalgesia) such as occurs in \ufb01bromyalgia, the data\nsuggest that cannabis therapies could be helpful. Unfortunately,the politics surrounding drug policy precludes these treatmentsfrom currently being used\u2014despite their being safer, more\neffective, and certainly less expensive than many other treatments.Cannabinoids\n221ment of pain. Addiction needs to be contrasted to a physical\ndependence and tolerance. Addiction is an uncontrolled compul-sive use of the drug even though it is harming the user. Clinicalexperience and medical literature suggest that this is a veryuncommon situation when opioids are used for chronic pain innon\u2013drug addicts. Habituation and physical dependence, however,are common with this family of medication as well as with anti-depressants, antiseizure medications, and many other medications.All this means is that you do not want to stop the medication sud-denly, as you might go through withdrawal. Instead, the medica-tion should be tapered off over time. Physical dependence does", "not usually become a problem in the clinical setting unless the\nmedication is stopped suddenly or the dose is reduced substantiallywithout tapering it.\nIn addition and as noted previously, Dr. Argo, a pain specialist\nat the pain management center at Columbia Rose Medical Cen-ter, Denver, has found that adding low-dose Elavil can markedlyenhance the effect of narcotic pain medications. In addition, tak-ing dextromethorphan (25 mg two times a day) can decrease thetolerance that people develop to a narcotic\u2019s effectiveness. Becauseof this, it is reasonable that anyone on narcotic pain medicationsshould also take dextromethorphan.\nIntravenous Pain Medications\nIn severe cases of persistent pain, the use of intravenous pain ther-apies can be powerfully effective. Anytime IV pain medicationsare used, it is worth giving intravenous nutritional support at thesame time. This can contribute powerfully to healing the under-lying problem, and a series of these treatments can help you feelbetter and may actually eliminate the source of the pain. These IVnutritional therapies are called Myers cocktails and are currentlybeing studied in a placebo-controlled trial.\nMagnesium\nIn a study of eighty-six patients with chronic muscle pain, includ-ing myofascial pain and \ufb01bromyalgia, a series of injections with IVor IM (intramuscular) magnesium with other nutrients, includingB vitamins, calcium, and vitamin C, was given. Seventy-four per-cent of the patients improved, with 64 percent requiring four orless injections to see optimal results. Some patients required long-term treatments to maintain the effect. Side effects leading to dis-continuation of therapy occurred in 4 percent of the patients. Theneed for prescriptions for anti-in\ufb02ammatory medications and mus-cle relaxants was decreased markedly. In addition (as noted inEFFECTIVE THERAPIES FOR CHRONIC PAIN AND RELATED PROBLEMS\n222", "Chapter 7), intravenous magnesium has also been shown to be\nvery helpful for acute migraine headaches.\nLidocaine\nA second highly effective intravenous pain therapy is the use oflidocaine. I have found this to be very effective in a large numberof patients with widespread pain. In my practice, I give a 60 mgtest dose during a time period of approximately forty-\ufb01ve min-utes. This is to screen for patients whose blood pressure tends todrop or who have other side effects. If the initial treatment iswell-tolerated, an additional 40 to 60 mg can be given the \ufb01rst day(this low dose is unlikely to result in much pain relief ). Forfollow-up treatments, I usually give 75 mg of lidocaine over atime period of approximately twenty minutes, followed by 2 mgper minute (120 mg per hour) for a total of 200 to 300 mg. Thiscan be repeated once or twice a week as needed, and pain relieftends to be more sustained after the \ufb01rst three to six treatments.\nUsing this treatment approach without heart monitoring is\ncontroversial because there\u2019s a possible risk of abnormal heartrhythms with lidocaine use. These abnormal rhythms occur pre-dominantly in patients who are in intensive care units for acuteheart attacks. I have never seen heart rhythm problems and do notuse monitoring because this can increase the patient\u2019s cost fromeighty to seven hundred dollars per dose. One study using high-dose lidocaine (up to approximately 500 mg per day over six hoursfor six days) showed marked pain improvement, but two of thepatients did have cardiac side effects that were transient but sig-ni\ufb01cant. This suggests that caution be used when administeringlidocaine in patients with heart problems.\nKetamine\nOther studies have also found IV ketamine (at a dose of 0.3 mgper kilogram over one half hour) to be helpful. Because of thesometimes uncomfortable spaciness/mental changes that can occurPRESCRIPTION THERAPIES: WE\u2019RE WAY PAST ASPIRIN!\n223", "during the IV infusion, IV ketamine is used less often than lido-\ncaine. Its main promise may be in the treatment of those withre\ufb02ex sympathetic dystrophy/regional c omplex pain syndrome\nand others with severe refractory pain (discussed in Chapter 4).Despite the intoxicated/dissociative feelings that can routinelyoccur with ketamine in higher dosing, it can be powerfully effec-tive in very dif\ufb01cult pain syndromes. Any uncomfortable (mostoften they are not) psychological side effects of ketamine can bedecreased by giving the patient Klonopin and having the patientsleep right after the injection.\nPrescription Sleep Medications\nAlthough I much prefer natural remedies to prescription medica-tions, the sleep disorder in some pain patients may be too severeto be dealt with by natural remedies alone. The medicationsdescribed in this section can help you get a full night\u2019s sleep.\nPrescription Sleep Aids\nFor all of the medications discussed here, most of the side effectsthat you may notice will occur the \ufb01rst day that you take the med-ication. Do not drive or operate hazardous equipment if you aresedated from the medications. As with almost everything, do nottake these medications if you are or are trying to get pregnant.Although in my experience it is very uncommon, it is possible toget unusual reactions from combining these medications. If amedication causes recurring nightmares, change the dose or themedication.\nAmbien (Zolpidem). I like Ambien because it is short-acting (that\nis, less likely to leave you hungover) and less likely to cause sideeffects than many other medications. Because it is short-acting, itmay not keep you asleep all through the night, but it will likelygive you four to six hours of good, solid sleep as a foundation. TheEFFECTIVE THERAPIES FOR CHRONIC PAIN AND RELATED PROBLEMS\n224", "normal dosage is one-half to one 10 mg tablet, taken at bedtime.\nIf you wake up in the middle of the night you can take an extrahalf to one tablet, and any sedation is usually gone by the time youare ready to wake up in the morning. One-half tablet is usuallyenough for the middle of the night. If you \ufb01nd that taking an addi-tional dose in the middle of the night leaves you hungover, switchto the new, sustained-release form, or use Sonata (described a fewsections later) when you wake instead.\nStudies have not shown a wearing-off effect with Ambien in\nmost people, nor have they found addiction with long-term use.What does occur, though, is rebound insomnia when you stopusing this medication\u2014that is, the need to use something else toassist your sleep for a week. Because of this, if you have takenAmbien for more than four months, use one of the other med-ications or natural sleep remedies discussed in this chapter for aweek or so to assist sleep during the time when you stop theAmbien. In my experience, Ambien can be helpful for restless legsyndrome as well.\nAlthough the use of Ambien is only FDA recommended for\nless than a month, a two-year study of four thousand patients withchronic insomnia showed that people were able to use it long termwhenever they needed it without developing any signi\ufb01cant prob-lems. Regardless of the package insert saying to only use Ambienfor a maximum of one month, both research studies and the expe-rience of many clinicians show that it can be used safely longterm. Rarely, I have seen patients develop depression after beingon Ambien for over a year. In these cases, the depression hasalways lifted quickly within a few days of stopping the Ambien.\nKlonopin (Clonazepam). Although in the Valium family, and\ntherefore potentially habit-forming, Klonopin can be very help-ful for people with pain and is excellent for patients with restlessleg syndrome. When used at doses of less than 2 mg a night, I havenot seen signi\ufb01cant problems with addiction. The main side effectPRESCRIPTION THERAPIES: WE\u2019RE WAY PAST ASPIRIN!\n225", "is next-day sedation, which is fairly common. If this occurs, take\na lower dose or take it several hours before bedtime. Because it ispotentially habituating (for example, it may cause withdrawal ifstopped abruptly), do not suddenly stop taking Klonopin if youhave been on it for over six weeks. Instead, taper off by decreas-ing the dosage by 0.25 to 0.5 mg a day every one to eight weeks.\nSonata (Zaleplon). Sonata (in 10 mg capsules) generally wears off\nwithin three to four hours, so it is best used in the middle of thenight (for example, at 4:00 a.m.) if you wake up and need some-\nthing to help you fall back to sleep, or if you have trouble fallingasleep but not staying asleep.\nLunesta (Eszopiclone). Taking 1 to 3 mg at bedtime can be mod-\nestly effective with few side effects. Oddly though, a third of peo-ple taking it get a funny taste.\nMuscle Relaxants That Help with Sleep\nFlexeril (cyclobenzaprine) is a muscle relaxant that can be a veryhelpful medication for many people, especially if the pain issevere. The usual dose is one-half to one 10 mg tablet at bedtime,but some people need to take two tablets at bedtime. The mainside effects are sedation and dry mouth and eyes.\nSoma (carisprodol) is predominantly a muscle relaxant, and I\nwould use this earlier in treatment if you are being kept awake bysevere pain. The usual dose is one-half to two 350 mg tablets atbedtime. Soma is potentially addictive, although I have almostnever seen withdrawal in patients who are only using one to twotablets at bedtime (as opposed to people taking it four times a dayfor pain). The main side effect is sedation.\nMedications That Help Both Pain and Sleep\nNeurontin (gabapentin) taken at bedtime can markedly help withboth sleep and pain in many patients. Y ou can take one to threeEFFECTIVE THERAPIES FOR CHRONIC PAIN AND RELATED PROBLEMS\n226", "capsules of 300 mg (though it also comes in 100 to 800 mg doses).\nIts main problem is next-day sedation, which often wears off withtime. It can also be taken during the day for pain relief at doses ofup to 4,800 mg daily.\nZana\ufb02ex (tizanidine) taken at bedtime can also be helpful for\nboth pain and sleep; the usual dosage is one-half to two 4 mgtablets. However, it rarely causes nightmares, so if this occursrepeatedly, stop the Zana\ufb02ex.\nGabitril (tiagabine) helps both pain and deep sleep. For sleep,\n2 to 8 mg at bedtime is a reasonable dose. In one study, Gabitrildecreased pain by approximately 30 percent and decreased sleepproblems by approximately 40 percent. Another bene\ufb01t is that theamount of time spent in deep, restorative sleep is increased.\nAntidepressants That Can Help with Sleep\nIn addition to the prescription medications previously mentioned,the serotonin-raising antidepressants known as SSRIs can helpimprove sleep. They also have many other bene\ufb01ts in treatingpain\u2014even if there is no depression present. These medicationsinclude Prozac (\ufb02uoxetine), Paxil (paroxetine), and Zoloft (ser-traline) and can improve sleep after six weeks.\nElavil (amitriptyline), technically an antidepressant, was one\nof the \ufb01rst medications to be studied for \ufb01bromyalgia and foundto be effective. It is also the only medication that many doctorshave heard of for treating \ufb01bromyalgia. Although Elavil can bevery helpful, it has signi\ufb01cant side effects and therefore is oftenone of the last treatments I try. These side effects include weightgain, dry mouth, sedation, aggravation of restless leg syndrome,neurally mediated hypotension, and abnormal heart rhythms. Itis, however, especially good for nerve pain, vulvadynia (pain inthe vulvar area), and, perhaps, interstitial cystitis characterized bysevere urinary frequency and burning without infection (seeChapter 9). If these are present, it is reasonable to start withElavil or a related medication. Y ou can take one-half to eightPRESCRIPTION THERAPIES: WE\u2019RE WAY PAST ASPIRIN!\n227", "10 mg tablets at bedtime. If you take more than two tablets, it\nshould be tapered off and not stopped suddenly. I would not usemore than 80 mg at bedtime (unless you have to) because of theside effects.\nDesyrel (trazodone) in high doses is marketed as an antide-\npressant, but at a low dose it is excellent for sleep and anxiety.Desyrel comes in 50 to 450 mg tablets, and the usual recommen-dation is to take one-half to six of the 50 mg tablets at bedtime(most patients need no more than two tablets). The main sideeffect of Desyrel is next-day sedation, and priapism can occur inmales. Priapism is a condition characterized by a painful erectionthat does not go away. This is unusual. Most men \ufb01nd that whileit causes an improvement in the strength of their erections, it doesso at a comfortable level, as opposed to an erection that will notgo away after a normal amount of time. If you develop an erec-tion that does not go away after an hour (despite a cold bath), stoptaking the medication and go to a hospital emergency room. Iferections are lasting longer than normal, you should stop theDesyrel and switch to the other medications.\nAdditional Medications for Sleep\nXanax (alprazolam) is a short-acting cousin of Valium that givesa good three to \ufb01ve hours of sleep with less hangover in themorning. I was pleasantly surprised to \ufb01nd that Xanax improvessleep quality because Valium usually seems to worsen this in mostpeople. Xanax is very good for anxiety as well and tends to bevery well tolerated; however, it can be addictive. The usualdosage is one-half to four 0.5 mg tablets at bedtime or during thenight.\nGHB (Xyrem) is an excellent (and possibly the best) sleep\nmedication for pain and \ufb01bromyalgia. However, because the DEAclaimed (many suspect mistakenly) that it was being used as a daterape drug, it has gone from being inexpensive and available overthe counter to being tightly regulated and costing approximatelyEFFECTIVE THERAPIES FOR CHRONIC PAIN AND RELATED PROBLEMS\n228", "\ufb01ve hundred dollars a month. If all else fails, Xyrem often works\nvery well. It comes as a liquid that can dissolve your enamel anddamage your teeth, however, so be sure to rinse your mouth welland swallow after taking the liquid to prevent this. Physiciansmust \ufb01ll out special forms when prescribing Xyrem.\nBenadryl (or doxylamine) is a common antihistamine that may\nalso help pain. The usual dose is 25 mg at night.\nCombining Sleep Aids for an Optimal Effect\nThere are several approaches to sleep when treating pain patients.Some doctors prefer to use a single medication or treatment andpush it up to its maximum level. If that works, great; if not, theystop it and switch to another medication. Other doctors prefer touse low doses of many different treatments together until thepatient is getting good, solid sleep regularly. I strongly prefer thelatter approach. Most of a medication\u2019s bene\ufb01ts occur at low doses,and most of the side effects at high doses. In addition, if you com-bine low doses of a few different sleep aids, each of them will becleared out of your body by morning\u2014so you won\u2019t be hungover.Meanwhile, the effective blood levels that you have during themiddle of the night from each treatment are cumulative and willkeep you asleep for eight to nine hours of solid sleep each nightwithout waking or hangover. If you\u2019re not sleeping eight to ninehours a night without waking, let your physician know so yourmedications can be adjusted.\nAs I mentioned earlier and depending on your preference, you\nmay want to start with the natural aids (for example, taking theRevitalizing Sleep Formula herbal remedy plus calcium and mag-nesium at bedtime), see how those work, and then use the pre-scription ones as needed. My preference is to start with at leastone of the sleep medications (Ambien and/or Klonopin) com-bined with some of the natural remedies. Ambien, Klonopin,Xanax, and Soma are considered potentially addictive, but in thedose and form that I use, this is rarely a problem. If you havePRESCRIPTION THERAPIES: WE\u2019RE WAY PAST ASPIRIN!\n229", "next-day sedation, try taking the medications (except for Sonata\nand Ambien) a few hours before bedtime. However you chooseto do it, on the \ufb01rst night begin with one of the remedies at a lowdose.\nFor most of the treatments recommended, by the next morn-\ning you will know the effects that it is going to have. It may, how-ever, take six to twelve weeks to see the full effect of 5-HTP andvalerian. In rare cases, some of these treatments have the oppositeof their normal effect, activating you instead of putting you tosleep. If this happens, don\u2019t use that treatment.\nOnce you have tried a low dose of a single treatment, increase\nthe dosage each night until you either get eight to nine hours ofsolid sleep without waking or feeling hungover, you get sideeffects (for example, next-day sedation), or you are at the maxi-mum dose recommended. Use the lowest dose that gives you themost bene\ufb01t. In other words, you may \ufb01nd that 50 mg of Desyrelis just as effective as 150 mg, in which case there is no need totake the higher dose. Once you have tried one treatment, you cango ahead and add in a second one in the way I just discussed, andthen a third one, and so on. Y ou may choose to initially try eachof them separately so you can see what each one does by itself, oryou may choose to simply add one treatment to the next. Basically,you are trying the treatments on to see what \u201c\ufb01ts,\u201d in the sameway you would try on shoes to see which pair feels the best. Onceyou have found the combination of treatments that feels the best,you can simply stay on that combination.\nWhy One Medication Doesn\u2019t Fit All\nIt is interesting to note that patients with \ufb01bromyalgia and otherpain syndromes often respond well to one medication but notanother that works by a different mechanism. Which treatmentswork varies from person to person. This demonstrates that thereis not a single cause to many pain problems.

Because of this, checking testosterone levels isappropriate in anyone, male or female, with sexual dysfunction\u2014especially in the presence of chronic pain. When treating for lowtestosterone, I strongly recommend that natural testosterone be usedinstead of synthetics. In men, testosterone 1 percent (Androgel) canbe applied to the skin over the shoulders and abdomen twice dailyfor a total daily dose of 25 to 100 mg. T estosterone cream can alsobe made less expensively by compounding pharmacists. T estos-terone tablets should not be used in men because the high dose canresult in elevated cholesterol levels when taken by mouth.\nIn men with low or low-normal testosterone who also had\nangina, high cholesterol, and/or diabetes, repeated studies haveshown decreased angina, cholesterol, and diabetes with the addi-tion of natural testosterone. Sadly, these data have been largelyignored. I bring my patients\u2019 testosterone blood levels up to themid to upper part of the normal range.\nT estosterone can also help loss of libido in women. For exam-\nple, a recent study has demonstrated that small doses of testos-terone may improve the sex lives of women who have hadhysterectomies. Delivered transdermally (via the skin) by a patchapplied twice a week, the testosterone raised desire and improvedfunction in 74 percent of the study participants. Even if you havenot had a hysterectomy, a trial of testosterone is reasonable if yourfree testosterone level (use the results of the free testosteroneblood test, not the total testosterone) is in the lowest quarter ofthe normal range. In women, 2 to 6 mg of testosterone in creamor tablet form daily is usually adequate and can help pain, libido,and overall well-being.\nOther factors also contribute to sexual dysfunction. These\ninclude pain caused from assuming sexual positions or marital stressfrom chronic pain. Antidepressants such as Prozac commonly causeEFFECTIVE THERAPIES FOR CHRONIC PAIN AND RELATED PROBLEMS\n234", "dif\ufb01culties with erections, decreased libido, and dif\ufb01culty with\nachieving orgasm (the latter being especially important in women).\nIf you need to continue the antidepressants, the associated sex-\nual dysfunction is treatable. One study showed that taking the herbginkgo biloba 120 mg twice daily often eliminated the sexual dys-function caused by antidepressants after six weeks (a lower dose wasnot as effective). Wellbutrin, trazodone, or Remeron do not seemto cause the sexual dysfunction caused by other antidepressants.\nMedications for Sexual Dysfunction\nI recommend using Viagra or Cialis for erectile dysfunction. Via-gra can be taken in doses of 25, 50, or 100 mg tablets. It is mosteffective when taken on an empty stomach, and the higher doseis often effective if the lower dose is not. In addition, it is gener-ally cheaper to buy a 100 mg tablet and break it in half than to buytwo 50 mg tablets. Cialis is a newer medication for erectile dys-function. It may work faster than Viagra (within ten to \ufb01fteenminutes), and the effects last for more than twenty-four hours. Itcomes in 10 and 20 mg strengths and can be taken with food.Neither medication should be used in conjunction with nitro-glycerin, and they may cause problems in patients with heart dis-ease. A newer medication that may not have this problem (calledvardena\ufb01l) is being developed.\nNatural Remedies for Treating \nSexual Dysfunction\nAt the 2004 meeting of the American Psychiatric Association,\nresearchers from Columbia University reported on the growinguse of complementary medicines to boost sexual function anddesire. The herb rhodiola, for example, may reduce prematureejaculation and boost sexual desire in both men and women. Rho-diola also seems to revive sexual energy, provide increased pleas-ure, improve erections, and intensify orgasms, allowing for moresatisfying sex. The presentation also discussed the effectiveness ofSEXUAL DYSFUNCTION, DEPRESSION, AND MIND-BODY ASPECTS OF PAIN\n235", "the herbs ginseng, ginkgo, maca, and horny goat weed in restor-\ning sexual desire and function in both men and women.\nPain, Anxiety, and Depression\nChronic pain, anxiety, and depression have long been linked, andpatients with chronic pain suffer a high incidence of majordepressive disorders (MDD). Thomas Elliott of St. Mary\u2019s DuluthClinic Health System set out to further characterize this link bylooking for correlations among age, sex, chronic pain, and depres-sion. He found that the prevalence of MDD was signi\ufb01cantlyhigher in younger patients with chronic pain\u201459 percent in theeighteen to forty-four years age group. Furthermore, 70 percentof women with chronic pain also suffered MDD, a signi\ufb01cantlyhigher percentage than the men in this sample. It is understand-able that anyone with a severe illness, especially one that is treatedas poorly as pain, would go through periods of depression. Y ouare not alone. With new treatments, however, you \ufb01nally have theopportunity to become pain free\u2014which is a great start at treat-ing depression!\nIt is OK to acknowledge that chronic pain devastates people\u2019s\nlives in many ways. It can dramatically worsen the quality of yourlife on many levels, including physical, social, emotional, and spir-itual. It can trigger depression, anxiety, and loss of independence.It also can severely interfere with your ability to work and main-tain friendships and relationships. All of these issues need to beaddressed and supported.\nPeople with chronic pain, however, are often afraid to bring up\nthese problems with their family, friends, and physicians. Althoughit may be appropriate not to continually bring up one\u2019s pain in per-sonal relationships, since you may \ufb01nd yourself getting tuned outand avoided, it is important that your doctor be made aware of per-sistent pain at each visit. Research has shown that patients are oftenhesitant to bring up their pain during doctor visits for the follow-ing reasons: they\u2019re afraid of being viewed as c omplainers, they areEFFECTIVE THERAPIES FOR CHRONIC PAIN AND RELATED PROBLEMS\n236", "concerned about distracting the doctor from other medical issues,\nor they have a fatalistic view that nothing can be done.\nIt is important to recognize that it is not OK to be left in\nchronic pain. Y ou need to make your doctor aware of your situa-tion if the pain is persistent and not adequately controlled. If yourphysician is not able or willing to take further measures to help,ask for a referral to a pain specialist (or another one if you arealready seeing one). If your doctor does not believe that anotherphysician may have any other options for you, let him or herknow about the options discussed in this book, or go ahead andget a second opinion on your own.\nNatural Remedies for Depression and Anxiety\nDepression can often be effectively treated using natural therapies.I recommend beginning by making sure that you have adequatelevels of most nutrients, particularly B vitamins (especially B \u2081\u2082and\nfolate). The easiest way to do this is with the Energy Revitaliza-tion System powder, which also dramatically raises levels ofSAM-e\u2014another nutrient highly effective against depression.Many studies show that SAM-e is as (or more) effective at treat-ing depression than tricyclics, without the side effects. Unfortu-nately, SAM-e tablets are not very stable, are very expensive, andrequire a high dose. Because of this, the vitamin powder is likelythe best approach. I recommend also adding \ufb01sh oil (one-half toone tablespoon per day) to your regimen. Several studies haveshown \ufb01sh oil to be very helpful in treating depression.\nSaint-John\u2019s-wort, 1,000 to 2,000 mg daily, is the next thing I\nwould add. Dozens of studies have found it to be as effective asprescription antidepressants for treating moderate depression. Likemost prescriptions, it is unlikely to be effective by itself for severedepression, although limited data suggest that higher doses mightbe effective. Do not combine it with prescription antidepressantsunless cleared by your doctor because the combination can (very,very rarely) drive serotonin levels dangerously high. In my prac-tice, I may combine Saint-John\u2019s-wort with prescription antide-SEXUAL DYSFUNCTION, DEPRESSION, AND MIND-BODY ASPECTS OF PAIN\n237", "pressants, because this allows for a lower dose of the antidepressant\nmedication and therefore fewer side effects.\n5-HTP , the nutrient that your body uses to make serotonin,\ncan also be helpful for both depression and pain. It also has thebene\ufb01t of improving sleep and causing weight loss. The usual doseis 200 to 400 mg at bedtime. As with Saint-John\u2019s-wort, it raisesserotonin levels, so limit the dose to 200 mg a day if taking it withantidepressants. Combining 5-HTP with the amino acid tyrosine\ncan make it even more effective.\nThe mineral rubidium, 500 mg daily with food, can also help\neven resistant depression. It takes one month to work and is avail-able without a prescription from compounding pharmacies. Instudies of the mineral, participants used between 180 to 720 mgdaily. Some minor side effects include constipation, diarrhea,insomnia, or agitation (do not use it if you have manic-depressiveillness/bipolar disorder). It is a good idea to eat a banana a day ortake a glass of V8 juice each day along with the rubidium.\nMagnolia delivers a double whammy. The herb magnolia is\nrich in honokiol and magnolol, which have numerous health ben-e\ufb01ts, especially their ability to alleviate both depression andstress\u2014without making you sleepy! See the website smart-publications.com/articles/040331magnolia.htm for more informationon this excellent herb.\nFor anxiety, high-dose vitamin B \u2081(thiamine) at 250 to 500 mg\nthree times a day and/or theanine, 50 to 300 mg a day, can have awonderfully calming effect, which continues to dramaticallyincrease over time when it is used regularly for two to six weeks.\nThere are two excellent products that contain many of the\nabove natural therapies and much more. For anxiety, I would takethe Calming Balance Formula, and for depression I recommendHappiness 1-2-3. Take one to three capsules of either (or both)three times a day. Although some bene\ufb01t is seen immediately, theeffectiveness increases markedly over two to six weeks, and mypatients love these products (see Appendix B).EFFECTIVE THERAPIES FOR CHRONIC PAIN AND RELATED PROBLEMS\n238", "Lifestyle Changes That Can Help with Depression\nOther commonsense approaches to treating depression are also\nvery important. Walking, for example, has been shown to be aseffective as Prozac in treating depression. Bright light exposureduring the wintertime, yoga and tai chi, spiritual healing, andother similar modalities can also be very helpful. Most important,it is essential that you get in touch with, and express, your feel-ings. My book Three Steps to Happiness: Healing Through Joy! is a\nshort book that will teach you how to do this (available online atvitality101.com).\nPain: The Mind-Body Connection\nEmotional stress can also contribute to pain. John Sarno, M.D., isa professor of clinical rehabilitation medicine at New Y ork Uni-versity School of Medicine and an attending physician at the RuskInstitute of Rehabilitation Medicine at New Y ork UniversityMedical Center. He found that the mind often decreases the blood\ufb02ow to areas of the body in an attempt to distract us from uncom-fortable emotions by causing pain. This occurs even though thepain is often hundreds of times more uncomfortable than the feel-ing our mind is trying to protect us from. Fortunately, although thepain caused by decreased blood \ufb02ow is real and can be severe, itgenerally does no permanent harm.\nThis concept may seem odd at \ufb01rst, but it gives us a powerful,\nsimple, safe, natural, and inexpensive way to eliminate many kindsof pains\u2014especially when we combine this knowledge with thephysical treatments. This approach is quite simple, and I \ufb01nd thatit works best for localized pain such as back pain, tendonitis, andlocalized nerve pain.\nAs noted, your mind may be decreasing blood \ufb02ow to muscles\nand other areas to distract you from uncomfortable emotional feel-ings or at other times because you are \u201cburying\u201d these feelings inyour muscles. When you feel pain, tell your mind that you willSEXUAL DYSFUNCTION, DEPRESSION, AND MIND-BODY ASPECTS OF PAIN\n239", "repeatedly use the pain as a signal to look for and feel those uncom-\nfortable emotions for ten to \ufb01fteen minutes\u2014then do so. The painwill often leave within six weeks. Interestingly, this works welleven for pain that began after an injury. For more informationabout this approach, read Dr. Sarno\u2019s books Healing Back Pain: The\nMind Body Connection and The Mind Body Prescription .\nDr. Sarno theorizes that what is actually causing pain is not the\nherniated disc, or some other structural condition, but a conditionof mild oxygen deprivation that is brought about by the brain sim-ply altering the blood \ufb02ow to a particular area. This mild oxygendeprivation is what causes pain in muscles, nerves, and tendonsanywhere in the body. He calls this tension myositis syndrome\n(TMS). He feels the problem is not based on in\ufb02ammation butrather a decreased oxygen supply. He theorizes that this is whytreatments that increase local circulation, such as deep heat in theform of ultrasound, deep massage, and active exercise can tem-porarily decrease pain.\nDr. Sarno explains that x-ray and MRI studies \ufb01nd normal\nchanges in the area of the pain that are unrelated to the pain. Hegives an example published in a 1994 research paper by MaureenJensen and colleagues in the New England Journal of Medicine .\nThey performed MRIs on about ninety-eight people who had nohistory of back pain. The researchers found normal discs in only36 percent of the people. Everyone else had bulges (herniations)of various kinds and yet no pain. That\u2019s the kind of informationthat doctors in this country totally ignore.\nEmotional Factors Associated with Pain\nDr. Sarno came to many of the same conclusions about the psy-chodynamic of pain that I discuss in my book From Fatigued to\nFantastic! The difference is that he feels that the pains come\nentirely from the psyche without a physical cause (other than theself-induced decreased blood \ufb02ow). In my experience, pain, muchlike other illnesses including heart attacks, cancer, and others, hasEFFECTIVE THERAPIES FOR CHRONIC PAIN AND RELATED PROBLEMS\n240", "both a physical and a psychospiritual component, and I \ufb01nd that\naddressing both simultaneously results in the best outcome.\nOther Important Mind-Body Issues\nThe bottom line is that if you are repressing emotions, not lettinggo of your feelings, and you feel like a victim (which leaves youpowerless), and you are not keeping your attention on what feelsgood when you can, you are likely to not stay healthy. This cycleof repression and lack of focus on what feels good can result inmany illnesses, including pain.\nIn addition to pain coming from decreased blood \ufb02ow to the\nmuscles, pain can also come from muscles being stuck in the short-ened position. In addition to the biochemical triggers that we havediscussed earlier in this book, this can occur in response to emo-tional stresses where we tighten our muscles as a form of \u201cemo-tional armor.\u201d It can also occur in response to other physicalinjuries. The body will often tighten the muscles in the area ofinjury to form a kind of a splint. This helps to decrease pain ini-tially, but can then add to pain in the long run.\nAnother critical point to remember is that we are only aware\nof less than 3 to 5 percent of the sensory input that comes into ourbrains at any given time. The rest is \ufb01ltered out. For example, takea moment to notice the sounds of your heating/cooling system,the buzzing of the lights, the feeling of the air on your skin, andthe numerous other sensations that you do not notice until some-body points them out. Pain is a fairly loud sensory input becauseit is meant to get our attention. It does so to tell us many things.We are familiar with the messages to avoid something traumatic,like our hand being on a hot stove, or to pay attention to and takecare of, an injury\u2014and we heed these messages fairly well. Weare now also aware of some of the less overt but equally impor-tant needs of our bodies that pain informs us of. These include thephysical needs of nutritional support, sleep, hormonal support, andeliminating infections. But the root causes of pain also include theSEXUAL DYSFUNCTION, DEPRESSION, AND MIND-BODY ASPECTS OF PAIN\n241", "psychological, and perhaps even the spiritual, needs to be true to\nourselves, acknowledge our feelings, and to do what feels best tous. This may not always be what other people are expecting of usor telling us to do. Simply attending to these issues will eliminatemany pains.\nIn other situations, there may be a malfunction in the pain sys-\ntem itself. Once your psyche knows that you have \ufb01nally attendedto those things you needed to pay attention to, a remarkable thingcan happen. Y our brain\u2019s \u201c\ufb01ltering system\u201d is now able to recog-nize that the pain signal is no longer important, and it can start to\ufb01lter the signal out as it does other sensory input presented to it.This process of muting your pain signal can be helped by themany pain treatments we\u2019ve discussed in this book. At this pointa fairly remarkable thing occurs. Y ou\u2019ll \ufb01nd that your chronic painbecomes intermittent, then mild, then gone!EFFECTIVE THERAPIES FOR CHRONIC PAIN AND RELATED PROBLEMS\n242", "", "Eliminating\nWeight Gain\nThis chapter is derived from an article on weight gain in pain-\nrelated illnesses that I wrote for a magazine. I think you will \ufb01ndit interesting, and it will also serve as a helpful overview of manyof the things we have discussed in the book.\nWeight gain can be a major problem in chronic pain and chronic\nstress states. For example, our study of \ufb01bromyalgia patients showedan average weight gain of thirty-two pounds. It\u2019s bad enough to feelawful and be in chronic pain, and the blow that many people feel totheir physical self-image from the weight gain can add further suf-fering. Why is weight gain such a problem? For starters, we live ina society where being overweight is epidemic. It is much easier tolose weight and keep it off, however, when you understand thatthere are many things that contribute to this problem. Most of usare familiar with the more common ones.\n\u2022The standard American diet (SAD). Our standard diet\ncontains excessive sugar and fat. In addition, food processing\ncauses the loss of many vitamins and minerals, resulting in\u201chigh calorie malnutrition.\u201d It is quite possible that this isthe \ufb01rst time in the history of the human race that this has\n243CHAPTER15\nCopyright \u00a9 200 6 by Jacob  Teitelbaum . Click here for terms of use.  ", "occurred! Being nutritionally de\ufb01cient in numerous vitamins\nand minerals is one of many causes of excessive foodcravings. Unfortunately, it is hard to get adequate nutritionout of the American diet, even if one\u2019s diet is relativelyhealthy.\n\u2022Lack of exercise. During most of human history, people\nhad to walk if they wanted to get somewhere. In addition,work often consisted of physical labor. This is no longer thecase. In fact, we often even get upset if we can\u2019t get aparking space right near the entrance of the mall!\nFor many people, simply altering their diet and increasing their\nexercise is enough to let them lose weight. A large percentage ofchronic pain sufferers, however, have found that it is impossibleto lose weight and keep it off no matter what they do.\nWhy Chronic Pain Makes It So Dif\ufb01cult to \nLose Weight and Keep It Off\nThere are a number of ways that stress, \ufb01bromyalgia, and/or\nchronic pain can contribute to your inability to lose weight. For-tunately, understanding these can help you overcome this problem.Both physical stresses (pain, infections, nutritional de\ufb01ciencies,toxic chemical exposures) and emotional/situational stresses (hav-ing a toxic boss, working too hard without enough sleep, worry-ing) can result in a metabolic chain reaction that results in weightgain. Chronic fatigue syndrome and \ufb01bromyalgia (CFS/FMS) aregood models for the occurrence of weight gain during stress andchronic pain.\nHow CFS/FMS Causes Weight Gain\nAs noted in Chapter 6, I do not view these syndromes as theenemy. Rather, I see them as attempts by the body to protect itselffrom further harm and damage in the face of excess energyEFFECTIVE THERAPIES FOR CHRONIC PAIN AND RELATED PROBLEMS\n244", "demands. A simple way to look at \ufb01bromyalgia and CFS is to view\nthem as circuit breakers. In a house, when certain systems areoverstressed, some of the circuit breakers will go off to preventdamage to the home\u2019s wiring. In CFS and \ufb01bromyalgia, the hypo-thalamus acts as a \u201ccircuit breaker\u201d going into hibernation in theface of excess stress. In the body, under normal circumstances, bysupplying proper rest and nutrition, the circuit breakers can comeback on and systems can return to healthy functioning. In CFS/FMS, however, it is as if the main circuit breaker (in this situationit\u2019s the hypothalamus\u2014a master gland in the brain) has \u201cblown.\u201dWhen this occurs, rest is no longer enough to restore properfunctioning.\nDespite the many diverse stresses that can cause these syn-\ndromes, most patients\u2019 symptoms seem to come from a commonendpoint\u2014dysfunction or suppression of the hypothalamus. Thisgland controls sleep, hormonal function, temperature regulation,and the autonomic nervous system (including blood pressure,blood \ufb02ow, and movement of food through the bowel). This iswhy these patients can\u2019t sleep, have low body temperatures, andbecause poor sleep causes immune dysfunction, are prone to mul-tiple and recurrent infections. The hypothalamic dysfunction byitself can cause most of these symptoms. In addition, I suspect thatproblems with the mitoc hondria (the \u201cenergy furnac es\u201d in the\ncells) are also present and are what cause hypothalamic suppression.\nThis process contributes to weight gain in several ways. The\nexpression \u201cgetting your beauty sleep\u201d has a basis in fact. Deepsleep is a major trigger for growth hormone production. Growthhormone stimulates production of muscle (which burns fat) andimproves insulin sensitivity (which decreases the tendency tomake fat). Getting the eight to nine hours of sleep a night that thehuman body is meant to have can powerfully contribute to yourstaying young and trim!\nThe other two main triggers for growth hormone production\nare exercise and sex. In fact, one study showed that people whoELIMINATING WEIGHT GAIN\n245", "have sex at least three times a week look ten years younger than\nthose who don\u2019t. The study notes that this was because of theincrease in growth hormone release.\nHow Stress and Hormones Contribute to Weight Gain\nAs noted in Chapter 2, the hypothalamic \u201ccircuit breaker\u201d thatgets suppressed with stress also controls the hormone system. Thisresults in inadequate levels of thyroid hormone (which acts as ourbody\u2019s gas pedal and burns calories) and adrenal hormone. Thesymptoms of hypothyroidism include weight gain as well asfatigue, cold intolerance, achiness, and poor mental function.\nThe adrenal gland is the body\u2019s stress handler. As discussed in\nChapter 2, when we are under stress our \u201c\ufb01ght or \ufb02ight reaction,\u201dmay be set off many times a day with little time in between torecover. This can result in exhaustion of the adrenal gland. As itis the job of the adrenal gland to maintain blood sugar levels intime of stress by making cortisol, people initially have elevatedcortisol levels, which results in weight gain.\nOver time, adrenal exhaustion occurs that can result in epi-\nsodes of hypoglycemia (low blood sugar). Unfortunately, peoplecrave sugar and eat more than they normally would when they gethypoglycemic. This leads to further weight gain, which can occurparadoxically whether your cortisol levels are too high or too low.Whether your cortisol is high or low, treating the overall processthat is causing your pain lowers the stress on your body and canhelp you lose weight.\nAdditional Factors That Lead to Weight Gain\nClinical experience has shown that fungal (also known as candidaor yeast) overgrowth (see Chapter 3) contributes powerfully toboth sugar cravings and weight gain. Although doctors do notknow the mechanism for this, we have repeatedly seen excessweight drop off once this overgrowth is treated and eliminated.The good news is that treating yeast overgrowth will not just helpEFFECTIVE THERAPIES FOR CHRONIC PAIN AND RELATED PROBLEMS\n246", "you to lose weight but can also help eliminate your spastic colon\nand sinusitis.\nHow to Lose Weight and Feel Better\nT o lose weight, cut down on sugar and simple carbohydrates (suchas potatoes, bread, and pasta) and increase your water intake. Wesometimes confuse thirst with hunger, and this leaves us eatingmore than we really want.\nNot to sound like a broken record here, but getting optimum\nnutritional support helps pain and also helps prevent weight gain.When you are de\ufb01cient in vitamins or minerals your body cravesmore food than you need, and your metabolism will be sluggish.T o keep it simple and avoid the need to take tablets all day, I rec-ommend that you use the Energy Revitalization System (see Chap-ter 2 and Appendix B). In addition, acetyl-L-carnitine 500 mgtwice a day can be very helpful as well.\nAgain, not to keep repeating myself, but to keep weight down,\nit\u2019s essential to get eight to nine hours of solid sleep a night. If youhave insomnia, herbals can help. I recommend Revitalizing SleepFormula, one to four capsules, one hour before bedtime. This is amix of six herbals and is the most effective natural sleep aid avail-able. (See Chapter 11 and Appendix B.)\nGetting exercise is also a key. Find something that is fun and\nfeels good. It also helps to have a regularly scheduled exercise timethree to four times a week in which you meet a friend to exercisewith. Otherwise, human nature is to make excuses not to show up!\nHaving even a few of the symptoms of hypothyroidism is\nenough to justify a therapeutic trial of thyroid hormone, whichmay help to counteract weight gain. If you are overweight, tired,and have cold intolerance or achiness, ask your holistic doctor fora prescription of Armour Thyroid. Adjust it to the dose that feelsbest while keeping the free T4 blood test in the normal range (seeChapter 2).ELIMINATING WEIGHT GAIN\n247", "Pay attention to adrenal stress support, as both elevated and low\nadrenal cortisol levels can cause weight gain. Start by making anattitude change.

I recommend Adrenal Stress End, one to two capsuleseach morning as needed (available online at vitality101.com).\nIf you have chronic sinusitis or spastic colon, there is a good\nchance you have fungal/yeast overgrowth in your bowels. Avoidsugar (stevia is a great substitute\u2014the best tasting one is by BodyEcology). Take Acidophilus Pearls (healthy milk bacteria to com-bat yeast), two pearls twice a day (see vitality101.com for sources).If you have a holistic physician, ask for a prescription for nystatinand Di\ufb02ucan antifungals (see Chapter 3).\nIt is no longer necessary to be on an extreme, unsustainable, or\nunhealthy diet to lose weight and keep it off. The preceding rec-ommendations will not just help you stay trim, but they will leaveyou healthy and full of vitality as well.\nManaging Medications That Affect Weight Gain\nand Loss\nMany medications contribute to weight gain. Lithium, for exam-\nple, has been associated with average weight gains of eight to thir-teen pounds. This is similar to the amount of weight gainassociated with taking Depakote (valproic acid). Antipsychoticmedications are also associated with gaining an average of four tonine pounds.\nIn the treatment of pain, however, the biggest culprits for\nweight gain are tricyclic antidepressants (such as Elavil). OtherEFFECTIVE THERAPIES FOR CHRONIC PAIN AND RELATED PROBLEMS\n248", "antidepressants such as those related to Prozac can cause either\nweight gain or weight loss depending on the individual. Medica-tions that increase norepinephrine such as Wellbutrin and Effexorare less likely to cause weight gain. In most studies, Lamictal pro-duced little or no weight gain.\nAlthough some medications used for pain management cause\nweight gain, others have the side effect of causing weight loss. Forexample, T opamax (topiramate) causes appetite suppression, withpeople on average losing 9 percent of their body weight. In stud-ies, the average weight loss was fourteen pounds; people whowere taking high doses (138 mg per day) lost more weight thanthose using low doses (70 mg a day, who experienced no weightloss). Zonegran (zonisamide), another antiseizure/pain medica-tion, is also associated with weight loss.ELIMINATING WEIGHT GAIN\n249", "This page intentionally left blank ", "Conclusion\nOne of the nice side effects of treating pain, \ufb01bromyalgia, and\nchronic fatigue syndrome is that in addition to feeling great youcan also look great.

I also provide an easy list of naturaland prescription therapies in addition to summarizing treatmentsfor related problems (i.e., sexual dysfunction and weight gain).\nOne important tool available on the website is a comprehen-\nsive pain treatment protocol form that lists over 280 treatmentoptions, including most of the treatments covered in this book,that can be helpful with pain and associated problems. It will giveyou and your doctor directions on how to use each of the recom-mended treatments.

Y ou maynotice that I often recommend products by Enzymatic Therapy(which sells to health food stores) and Integrative Therapeutics(which sells predominately to practitioners). This is because in mytwenty-eight years of practice I have found them to be an incred-ibly reliable source for natural products. I was amazed to \ufb01nd thatthey both voluntarily registered with the FDA as pharmaceuticalcompanies, even though they only make natural products. Becauseof this, their products are subject to an incredibly high level oftesting so you can be sure that what you are getting is the bestquality supplement possible. (I do not take money from any com-pany whose products I recommend.)\nSupplements and Other Products Available at\nVitality101.com\nI developed these products to meet the needs of my patients and\nothers suffering from pain, \ufb01bromyalgia, and chronic fatigue. Iknow that when I see a \u201cDr. Smith\u2019s Formula,\u201d I worry that Dr.Smith might have \u201csold out.\u201d Because of this, I direct any com-pany making my formulas to donate all of my royalties to charity.\nT o order recommended products online, go to vitality101\n.com, or call 410-573-5389 (my website and of\ufb01ce number). Y ouRESOURCES FOR FINDING PHYSICIANS AND SUPPLIES\n259", "can also go to enzy.com to \ufb01nd stores near you that carry many of\nthese products.These are just a few of the products available at vitality101.com.\nEnergy Revitalization System Vitamin Powder with\nB-Complex\nI developed this product so that my patients could easily get the\nnutritional support they need without taking handfuls of tablets. Asnoted previously, 100 percent of my royalties go to charity, and theproduct is available in most health food stores or at vitality101.com.\nOne good-tasting drink and one capsule replace over thirty-\n\ufb01ve tablets of supplements a day (including, of course, your mul-tivitamin). The Energy Revitalization System contains over \ufb01ftynutrients, almost all the key nutrients that you need to get fromyour diet. Many people \ufb01nd that this product can help them feelmuch better while decreasing and sometimes eliminating theirpain. This is the single most important supplement for helpingyour body to heal!\nFatigued to Fantastic! Revitalizing Sleep Formula\nThis formula helps you get to sleep faster and maintain a healthysleep cycle through the night so you wake up energized and withless pain. Lack of sleep at night can lead to daytime sleepiness andpain and negatively impact your daily activities. These herbs alsodecrease pain directly by acting as muscle relaxants, and theydecrease stress and anxiety. For optimum results, use one to fourcapsules taken one-half to one and a half hours before bedtime.\nAdrenal Stress End\nThis provides excellent adrenal support for those who crash withstress or get irritable when hungry (sign of low adrenal function).It helps you maintain calm, stable energy throuhout the day.\nEnd Pain Formula\nThis natural formula contains willow bark, boswelliea, and cherry,wonderful ingredients for relief of in\ufb02ammation and pain. ForAPPENDIX B\n260", "chronic pain, it can take two to six weeks to see the full effect.\nBegin with two to four capsules, three times a day. After sixweeks, you can often lower the dose to one capsule three times aday or take it as needed.\nCorvalen (D-Ribose)\nThis energy metabolite can have a dramatic effect on decreasingpain and increasing energy in many pain patients. Try one con-tainer to see what it will do for you.\nFish Oils\nFish oil de\ufb01ciencies can contribute to pain and many other prob-lems. I have seen people come off of chronic morphine by taking\ufb01sh oil. I strongly recommend using the Eskimo 3 or Nordic Nat-urals brands because they do not contain mercury, lead, or othertoxins. The usual dose is one-half to two tablespoons daily forthree to nine months. Dry eyes, dry mouth, and in\ufb02ammation areindicators of inadequate \ufb01sh oil in the body.\nSugar Substitutes\nThere are many healthy sugar substitutes. Stevia is excellent,healthy, and easy to use. I recommend the Body Ecology brand(many others are bitter).\nInositol (which helps anxiety and nerve pain) and xylitol\n(which decreases osteoporosis) look and taste just like sugar.Outside of occasionally causing loose stools, these are healthyand you can use all you want. These products are available atvitality101.com. Saccharin (comes in the pink packets) is alsoOK, and I suspect Splenda will also turn out to be OK. RussellStover has a whole line of sugar-free chocolates that areoutstanding.\nSupplements for Anxiety and Depression\nThere are two excellent products for these. For anxiety, I woulduse the Calming Balance Formula. For Depression, I recommendHappiness 1-2-3!RESOURCES FOR FINDING PHYSICIANS AND SUPPLIES\n261", "Enzymes for Pain Relief and In\ufb02ammation\nMy favorite enzyme supplements for pain and in\ufb02ammation are\nMegaZyme by Enzymatic Therapy and Ultrazyme by IntegrativeTherapeutics. I recommend that you take them on an emptystomach because enzymes are most effective at reducing pain andin\ufb02ammation when you take them between meals so they getabsorbed into your body instead of being used for digestion. (UseCompleteGest if your purpose is to aid digestion.) All of theseproducts are available at vitality101.com.\nFor acute pain, enzymes can be taken for a few days as needed.\nFor chronic pain, begin by taking either MegaZyme or Ultrazymeregularly (two to three tablets three times a day) between meals forsix to twelve weeks to see how much it helps or until the pain andin\ufb02ammation are gone. Then you can take the enzymes as needed.\nWholesalers of Recommended Products\nThe following companies also sell the recommended productswholesale directly to health practitioners:\n\u2022Integrative Therapeutics carries many of the natural\nproducts discussed in this book.

After hav-\ning several very stressful years that made medical school look easy,I came down with \ufb01bromyalgia, myofascial pain syndrome, andchronic fatigue syndrome (CFS). This gave me \ufb01rsthand experiencewith widespread muscle pain. It also gave me an enormous incen-tive to learn how to overcome these problems. Having widespreadachiness was dif\ufb01cult, but it taught me an enormous amount. Ilearned how a tight muscular knot (trigger point) in one area cancause pain and tenderness elsewhere in the body. I also found thattight muscles can cause other apparently unrelated symptoms likenausea, acid re\ufb02ux, and diarrhea. It was quite an education!\nSeveral other experiences broadened my \u201cpain horizon\u201d dra-\nmatically. During my medical residency in 1979, I was working\nin the outpatient clinic. We would all cringe when one of thepatients, an ornery, hunched-over elderly woman, came in. Shewas always in severe back pain, and no one could help her. Dur-ing one of her visits, she told me that when she pushed on a lumpon her back that was about a foot away from her discomfort ittriggered her pain. I mentioned this to my instructor, Dr. JohnStuckey, and his eyes lit up. He said, \u201cWatch this,\u201d and with asmile he injected the lump with a little lidocaine (Novocain). Thewoman was able to stand up straight, pain free for the \ufb01rst time inyears. Without the chronic pain, she was the sweetest person youcould imagine!\nAt that time I had no idea why this had worked, but I rapidly\nlearned about doing trigger point injections. Several years later,after reviewing thousands of research studies and attempting many\nxi\nCopyright \u00a9 200 6 by Jacob  Teitelbaum .

Despite being aninternist I had, by default, become the pain specialist in town.\nI soon found out that other doctors had also discovered simi-\nlar principles of pain management. T wo of these spectacular physi-cians, Dr. Janet Travell and Dr. David Simons, had written a book,which a patient of mine gave me, called The Trigger Point Manual .\nIn it, the authors had long before documented the concepts that Ihad thought I had discovered. Dr. Travell was a professor atGeorge Washington Medical School and the White House physi-cian for Presidents Kennedy and Johnson. She has since passed on.Dr. Travell and Dr. Simons are the \u201cgrandparents\u201d of modernpain management. Their book expanded the understanding oftreatment dramatically for pain specialists. They also laid the foun-dation for your getting well!\nYou Are Not Alone in Your Pain\nChronic pain is a very common problem affecting millions ofAmericans. In a 1999 American Pain Society survey, 9 percent ofthe American adult population was found to suffer from moder-ate to severe non\u2013cancer-related chronic pain. Fifty-six percentof these had suffered for over \ufb01ve years. When the researchersreviewed 805 chronic pain patients, they found that over half ofthem had changed doctors because their physicians were unwill-ing or unable to adequately and appropriately treat their pain.\nIn addition to the ways in which it devastates people\u2019s lives,\nchronic pain is one of the most expensive medical conditions inthe United States. The price tag, including loss of productivity,loss of income, and medical costs, exceeds $100 billion annually.Over $61 billion is lost in productive work time because of pain,even if the person is able to work. Our track record for treatingcancer-related pain is equally devastating. The American CancerSociety estimates that an enormous number of advanced cancerpatients suffer from inadequately treated chronic pain.INTRODUCTION\nxii", "However, the \ufb01nancial costs pale in comparison to the suffer-\ning and loss of personal relationships, functional ability, and evenlength of life, as well as the depression and anxiety caused bychronic pain. The good news is that most chronic pain can now be\neffectively treated . Unfortunately, most doctors have not yet been\ntrained in proper pain management. However, this does not meanthat you have to wait to get relief. This book has been written togive you and your physician the information you need so that youcan be pain free now and get your life back.\nGood News for Chronic Pain Sufferers\nI can summarize most of what I was taught about pain in medicalschool in one paragraph. Use Tylenol and/or Advil family medica-tions. If the patient has cancer, you can use narcotics if you haveto. Were I a surgeon, surgical options might be added. I was giventhe impression that chiropractors, and anyone else who offeredsomething that wasn\u2019t taught in medical school, were quacks try-ing to steal people\u2019s money and that physicians needed to protectgullible patients from them. Although this may seem like a sadassessment, I suspect that most of you who have chronic pain willagree with it. Many physicians reading this book will also \ufb01nd thatthis mirrors their experience.\nThe good news is that you don\u2019t have to be in pain anymore!\nThe use of both natural and allopathic (prescription) medicine dra-matically increases our ability to help you get well. Although bothallopathic and natural medicines have their weaknesses, when youcombine them, almost all pain can be effectively treated. It\u2019s thedifference between having only one tool\u2014say a hammer, whichis like allopathic medicine\u2014or a whole tool kit that includes thedozens of other healing arts available in natural medicine. A ham-mer can be a very useful tool, but unfortunately when all you haveis a hammer, everything starts to look like a nail! It\u2019s much easierto get the job done safely and effectively when you are using allthe tools available to you.INTRODUCTION\nxiii", "Doctors are usually better at treating acute, short-lasting pain\nsuch as that from injuries or surgery because they are better ableto \ufb01nd the source of the pain and are more comfortable usingavailable treatments on a short-term basis. Treating chronic painproblems such as \ufb01bromyalgia and myofascial/muscle pain, can-cer pain, arthritis, headaches, back pain, and nerve pain is more ofa challenge for physicians.\nClosing the Gap Between Allopathic and \nNatural Medicine\nThere seems to be much confusion and con\ufb02ict over whether nat-\nural or prescription medicines are the best. On one hand, thereare those who claim that pharmaceuticals are the new panacea foreverything, while natural remedies are unregulated, unproven,and ineffective forms of snake oil. On the other hand, there arethose who say that surgery and prescription medications arehighly toxic and too expensive. They claim that we should onlyuse natural medicines and point out their safety record. How arewe to make sense of all this confusion?\nI choose to keep the best of both systems. Over the decades,\nI\u2019ve often had to struggle with the perceived con\ufb02ict betweenthese two wonderful and powerful branches of the healing arts.When we examine these systems closely, however, there is nocon\ufb02ict between them. Complementary and alternative medicine\n(CAM), or natural therapies, offer the vast variety and power thatnature brings to healing through herbs, nutrition, and energy/spirit. Using a mix of intuition, experience, and science\u2014like amother taking care of her child\u2014it is most interested simply inwhat works and what is safe. This results in it being very open-minded and accounts for its current rapid growth.\nAllopathic medicine focuses largely on that which is patentable.\nIt mainly deals with prescriptions and can sometimes use the pow-erful tools of science to develop effective new remedies. Scienti\ufb01cdebate within the medical community can be very useful for sort-ing out what works and dealing with things that the scientistsINTRODUCTION\nxiv", "believe in, such as prescriptions. Allopathic medicine, however, is\nmuch too biased to be objective when it comes to evaluating nat-ural remedies. For example, if given the power to regulate naturalmedicines, the FDA would likely regulate them out of existence.Because of this, Congress appropriately protects natural products.\nAlthough natural therapies have their strengths, they also have\ntheir shortcomings. One of these is quality control. Where anallopathic medication has to go through stringent testing forpotency and purity, natural remedies are viewed as foods and donot have adequate regulation. Because of this, many products havelittle or none of the potency they claim to have and therefore,although cheap, do nothing. Because this is a major problem, I amvery picky about which products and companies I recommend.For example, two natural products companies, Enzymatic Ther-apy and Integrative Therapeutics/ITI, have voluntarily registeredwith the FDA as pharmaceutical companies, which means theirproducts have the same quality control as prescriptions. In time,Congress will recognize that quality control regulation is neededfor all natural products, but hopefully will put it in the hands ofpeople who are knowledgeable and open-minded about them.\nI simply propose that you use the best of both systems. T o\nmake this easier for you, and to maintain objectivity, I have a pol-icy of not taking money from any companies (natural or pharma-ceutical) whose products I recommend. In addition, for theproducts I make, 100 percent of my royalties go to charity. There\u2019snothing wrong with money. I simply don\u2019t want it to get in theway of your getting well!\nHow This Book Can Help You\nIn Part I, I will begin by brie\ufb02y reviewing the purpose of pain andthe general principles of pain relief. I will then discuss the differ-ent types of pain in Part II. By knowing the type of pain that youhave\u2014nerve, muscle/ligament/tendon/bone, arthritic/in\ufb02amma-tory, and so on\u2014you can tailor your treatment approach to makeit more effective, and your ability to make the pain go awayINTRODUCTION\nxv", "increases dramatically. I will also discuss the most common causes\nof pain\u2014such as headache, back pain, pelvic pain, and so on\u2014andhow to effectively treat them. For some readers, the pain is wide-spread. For others, it is localized. For most kinds of pain there aregeneral principles that are helpful for healing. These are especiallyimportant for myofascial (muscle and tendon) pain, but are impor-tant for most other pain conditions as well. In Part III, I teach youboth natural and prescription approaches that can help the pain goaway and discuss the pros and cons of each, enabling you to makethe best use of all available treatments. Mind-body issues are alsoreviewed, as well as related problems that can be associated withand caused by pain such as sexual dysfunction, depression, andweight gain.\nAppendix A describes additional useful information found on\nmy website, vitality101.com. This includes more detailed discus-sions of the topics covered in each chapter. Appendix B offershelpful resources for \ufb01nding a physician, supplies and services, andtools and products that can help you get well. T o help your doc-tor become more comfortable with the treatments in this book,Appendix C gives reference information that supports thesetreatments.INTRODUCTION\nxvi", "PART I\nGeneral Principles \nof Pain Relief\nBasically, there are two main principles of pain relief. First, you want\nto supply your body with what it needs for healing and tissue repair.These critical areas include optimum nutrition (often well beyondRDA levels), eight to ten hours of deep sleep each night, and opti-mal hormonal levels (simply having a hormonal blood test be \u201cnor-mal\u201d may not be adequate). The second principle is that you wantto treat or eliminate things that stress your body and cause pain(which include infections; toxins such as chemicals and heavy met-als; in\ufb02ammation; mechanical stresses on the body; excessive situa-tional, psychological, or physical stresses; and abnormal tissuecompression such as that caused by cancers). In these next few chap-ters, I will outline these critical areas and triggers so you can getstarted on the right path toward pain relief.\n1\nCopyright \u00a9 200 6 by Jacob  Teitelbaum .

Y ou may have received little relief from currentmedical approaches. In fact, you may not even know what is caus-ing your pain.\nPain Free 1-2-3 will teach you how to determine the cause of\nyour pain and how to make it go away. Although an enormousamount of new research is emerging on the complex biochemistryof pain\u2014and this information helps when creating new approachesfor pain relief\u2014dazzling you with this dif\ufb01cult biochemistry is notmy goal. My purpose is to give you the information that you needto give your body what it needs and help you move forward so youcan get a life that you love.\nWhile I won\u2019t give all of the thousands of research studies and\nreports that this book is based on, I will give some references thatI think your doctor (or you if you have a scienti\ufb01c interest) will \ufb01ndhelpful (see Appendix C). For areas of special interest to you, moredetailed technical information can be found on my website underthe Pain Free 1-2-3 \u201cNotes.\u201d For now, let\u2019s start with the basics.\nWhat Is Pain?\nThe International Association for the Study of Pain de\ufb01nes pain\nas \u201can unpleasant sensory and emotional experience associated 3CHAPTER1\nCopyright \u00a9 200 6 by Jacob  Teitelbaum . Click here for terms of use.", "with actual or potential tissue damage or described in terms of\nsuch damage.\u201d Y ou don\u2019t need such a c omplex de\ufb01nition, how-\never. Y ou know pain when you feel it.\nPain can be divided into two basic categories: acute pain and\nchronic pain. Acute pain, which usually results from tissue injury,in\ufb02ammation, or illness, often occurs suddenly after surgery orinjury. Usually doctors can \ufb01gure out what caused it, and it goesaway on its own or with treatment. Chronic pain, on the otherhand, can last for many years and is poorly treated medically.Chronic pain is the main focus of this book, although acute painwill also be addressed.\nThe Critical Function of Pain\nAlthough chronic pain can be devastating, pain serves a criticalfunction. It is a warning system for your body. Pain tells you whenyou need to avoid something so you do not cause damage to your-self. In addition, pain tells you when your body is not gettingwhat it needs\u2014sleep, nutrients, oxygen, and so on. For example,there is a genetic disease called hereditary sensory and autonomicneuropathy, or HSAN. People who suffer from this disease areborn without any ability to feel pain. Y ou may think this wouldbe wonderful, but it is not. These people die very young and crip-pled. If a sufferer of this disease breaks a leg, he has no pain andstill tries to walk, causing further damage. If his hand is on a hotstove, he does not know it until he smells something burning.\nPain is not the enemy. It is an important warning system. But\nwhen pain goes out of balance and becomes chronic, it may end upcausing more harm than good. Therefore, in addition to teachingyou how to turn off the pain signal, I will also help you understandwhat pain is trying to tell you about what your body needs.\nHow Do I Turn Off the Pain Signal?\nY ou turn off the pain by giving your body what it needs and byeliminating what is damaging or toxic to your body. For example,GENERAL PRINCIPLES OF PAIN RELIEF\n4", "one of the most common types of pain is muscle or myofascial\npain. The medical profession very poorly understands this type ofpain. Although we might think that muscles will go limp if theydo not have what they need, consider rigor mortis. When some-one dies and the muscles are not getting what they need, they donot become loose\u2014in fact they become stiff as a board. If yourliving muscles do not have adequate nutrients, optimal hormonelevels, or enough sleep for tissue repair, they will get stuck in theshortened position and cause pain. Underlying infections can alsocause your muscles to get stuck in the shortened position. Pain isyour body\u2019s way of saying that these problems need to beaddressed. Y ou\u2019ll be amazed at how pain that has lasted decadescan go away quickly when these problems are taken care of. Wewill discuss this in more depth in Chapters 2 and 3.\nOften, \ufb01nding the right medication for pain is like trying on\ndifferent shoes to see which \ufb01ts the best. In the current medical\u201cshoe store\u201d there are one or two pairs to try on. If these few\u201cshoes\u201d don\u2019t \ufb01t, you are out of luck. Fortunately, there are actu-ally many dozens of treatments to try, and when one doesn\u2019t \ufb01tanother often will.\nIn addition, pain management is a perfect place to combine tra-\nditional and c omplementary therapi es. The dif\ufb01culty that patients\nhave in \ufb01nding doctors that can effectively treat their pain is driv-ing them to alternative healers in droves. In fact, according to theJournal of the American Medical Association , pain is the number one\nreason why people use alternative medicine, which includes chi-ropractic, naturopathic medicine, acupuncture, biofeedback, mas-sage, Reiki, meditation, and other techniques. Often, it is dif\ufb01cultto treat chronic pain with a single \u201cmagic bullet.\u201d It takes a prac-titioner who is knowledgeable about many treatment modalitiesand who is also a compassionate listener.WHY WE HAVE PAIN\n5", "This page intentionally left blank", "Giving Your Body \nWhat It Needs to \nHeal Your Pain\nThis chapter explains how to optimize nutritional support, get\nadequate sleep, and address hormonal de\ufb01ciencies. Pain often willnot go away until each area of the body\u2019s need is adequately han-dled. For example, it may surprise you to know that nutritionaland hormonal de\ufb01ciencies and/or fungal infections (usually sec-ondary to antibiotic use) can aggravate neuropathic or back pain.Because of this, it is a good idea for you to read this entire chap-ter, as I outline a simpli\ufb01ed approach for making sure that all ofthe key principles for treating your pain are addressed.\nIt is important not to forget that some simple general princi-\nples and lifestyle issues are critical to the treatment of chronicpain. For example, exercise daily for at least twenty minutes ifyou\u2019re able. Swimming, walking, and yoga are good choices.\nOptimizing Nutritional Support\nThe American diet is awful. In fact, it is often called the \u201cstandardAmerican diet,\u201d or SAD, and the initials are appropriate. The aver-age American\u2019s diet includes 150 pounds of added sugar per year,CHAPTER2\n7\nCopyright \u00a9 200 6 by Jacob  Teitelbaum . Click here for terms of use.  ", "accounting for approximately 18 percent of caloric intake. Sugar\nsuppresses your immune system and stimulates yeast overgrowth inyour bowel. Y east grows by fermenting sugar and says thank youfor all this added sugar by making billions of baby yeasts.\nAnother dietary stress is white \ufb02our. Vitamins were discovered\nby a settler who went on sailing expeditions with Dutch explor-ers. He found that the colonists were becoming ill, yet thecolony\u2019s chickens were looking unusually healthy. Finding this tobe curious, he began feeding the chickens\u2019 food to the people.Over a period of several weeks, the people became stronger andhealthier. He (incorrectly) named the chicken feed vital amines ,\nmeaning \u201cvital proteins,\u201d and began selling it. The name was latershortened to vitamins .\nT oday, scientists understand what happened to those colonists.\nPolishing off the brown outer coat, or bran, from rice hadbecome fashionable. The rice bran was then used as chicken feed.The bran, however, contains most of the vitamins and minerals.The colonists therefore quickly became nutritionally de\ufb01cient,while the chickens \ufb02ourished. In the United States, approximately18 percent of calories come from white \ufb02our. However, white\ufb02our, just like white rice, has had the bran removed and thereforeis also signi\ufb01cantly depleted of vitamins and minerals.\nAs you can see, from just the use of white \ufb02our and added\nsugar, Americans often reduce their vitamin and mineral intake byaround 35 percent. Adding to this problem are the nutrients thatare lost in the canning of vegetables and in the processing offoods, which can cause vitamin losses of up to 80 percent.\nThe Link Between Nutrient De\ufb01ciency, Diseases, and\nChronic Pain\nAs Dr. S. B. Eaton noted in his study in the prestigious New\nEngland Journal of Medicine , \u201cPhysicians and nutritionists are\nincreasingly convinced that the dietary habits adopted by West-ern society over the past one hundred years make an importantetiologic [causative] contribution to coronary heart diseasesGENERAL PRINCIPLES OF PAIN RELIEF\n8", "[angina], hypertension, diabetes, and some types of cancer.\u201d This\nis the same conclusion that was reached by the authors of Western\nDiseases: Their Emergence and Prevention by the Harvard Univer-\nsity Press.\nJust as nutritional de\ufb01ciencies can cause these medical prob-\nlems, not having adequate nutrients can cause pain and keep thepain from going away. The late Dr. Janet Travell, White Housephysician for Presidents John F . Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnsonand professor emeritus of internal medicine at George Washing-ton University, cowrote Myofascial Pain and Dysfunction: The Trig-\nger Point Manual , which is acknowledged as the authoritative work\non muscle pain. In one chapter alone, Dr. Travell and coauthor Dr.David Simons referenced 317 studies showing that problems suchas hormonal, vitamin, and mineral de\ufb01ciencies can contribute tomuscle disorders. Dr. Travell strongly encouraged me in my work,and my landmark study on effective pain management was dedi-cated to her memory.\nNumerous other studies have shown that adequate amounts of\nvitamins and minerals, especially folic acid, zinc (found to be verylow in people with \ufb01bromyalgia), and selenium, are critical forproper immune function\u2014that is, for defense against infections.Vitamin A, beta-carotene, vitamin B \u2086, vitamin C, vitamin E, iron,\nand many other nutrients also have been found to be very impor-tant in keeping the body\u2019s defenses strong.\nAddressing Skeptics\nI sometimes hear doctors express skepticism about the importanceof nutritional supplements. A typical comment is, \u201cFive hundredyears ago, there were no vitamin tablets, and people seemed to dojust \ufb01ne.\u201d These doctors forget that \ufb01ve hundred years ago sugarwas expensive and not readily available. The king of Englandmight have sprinkled a teaspoon of sugar on his food as a sign ofpower, but he had to send someone to the West Indies to get it!People ate whole-grain bread and fresh locally grown produce,and only the wealthiest had re\ufb01ned \ufb02our or much fatty meat.GIVING YOUR BODY WHAT IT NEEDS TO HEAL YOUR PAIN\n9", "The argument about people not needing vitamin tablets \ufb01ve\nhundred years ago simply does not apply to the average modernAmerican. A study reported in the American Journal of Clinical\nNutrition showed that fewer than 5 percent of the study partici-\npants consumed the recommended daily amounts (RDAs) of alltheir needed vitamins and minerals. What is frightening is thatthis study was conducted in Beltsville, Maryland, on e mployees of\nthe U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) research center.\nDespite this, some cynics still like to say that the vitamins go\nout in your urine, so all you\u2019re doing by taking vitamin supple-ments is making expensive urine. Using this line of reasoning,these cynics can stop drinking water (it just goes out in theirurine). That way, they\u2019ll soon stop annoying people who are inthe process of getting themselves well.\nVitamin and Mineral Supplementation\nEvery vitamin and nutritional mineral, amino acid, and nutritionalcofactor is very important in some way to health. The bodydepends on receiving vitamins and minerals from the diet becauseit cannot make them itself. If you are low in vitamins, minerals, and\nother nutrients, your pain simply will not go away! Because of this, an\nexcellent nutritional supplement is critical to your becoming painfree.\nFor example, inositol; vitamins B \u2081, B \u2086, and B \u2081\u2082; zinc; and\nantioxidants are critical for healing neuropathies (nerve pain). Formuscle pain, magnesium, B vitamins, antioxidants, zinc, iodine,selenium, and malic acid are critical. In fact, each kind of pain hasdifferent nutrients that are important for its relief.\nAs there are literally dozens of different nutrients that are crit-\nical for tissue repair, I recommend that you use a powdered nutri-tional supplement called the Energy Revitalization System byEnzymatic Therapy. I developed this product so that my patientscould easily get the nutritional support they need without takinghandfuls of tablets. One hundred percent of my royalties go tocharity, and the product is available in most health food stores (orGENERAL PRINCIPLES OF PAIN RELIEF\n10", "online at vitality101.com). One good-tasting drink and one cap-\nsule replace over thirty-\ufb01ve tablets of supplements a day. TheEnergy Revitalization System, which consists of a vitamin pow-der and a B-complex drink, contains over \ufb01fty nutrients includ-ing almost all the key nutrients recommended in this chapterexcept for iron (which is toxic to take unless you are iron de\ufb01-cient), calcium (which blocks thyroid hormone absorption andshould be taken at nighttime), and essential fatty acids (oil andwater don\u2019t mix). Many people \ufb01nd that simply taking this prod-uct for optimal nutritional support can help them feel much bet-ter while decreasing and sometimes eliminating their pain after sixweeks. It can replace the multivitamin and almost all of the nutri-tional supplements that most people take. (T o make it easy, whenI recommend speci\ufb01c nutrients I will often note whether or notthey are in the vitamin powder and B-complex drink, althoughmost are.) Alternatively, the individual nutrients I recommend canbe obtained separately or in other forms.\nSome people will develop diarrhea from products containing\nmagnesium. Most people, however, \ufb01nd that the vitamin powdersimply makes them wonderfully regular. If diarrhea is a problem,you can cut the dose of the powder in half or take it with milk,and this will usually take care of it. In addition, any supplementcontaining B vitamins can turn your urine bright yellow. This isnormal.\nAlthough many excellent physicians use them, I do not rec-\nommend checking blood levels for most nutrients because the testsare often inaccurate, expensive, and/or unnecessary. I feel it is bet-ter and less expensive to simply use the vitamin powder. Theexceptions would be iron and vitamin B\n12levels. Let\u2019s discuss\nsome key nutrients in a bit more depth.\nIron. Iron is important because an iron level that is too low can\ncause pain, fatigue, poor immune function, cold intolerance,decreased thyroid function, and poor memory. T oo high an ironlevel can cause arthritis, diabetes, in\ufb02ammation, and even death.GIVING YOUR BODY WHAT IT NEEDS TO HEAL YOUR PAIN\n11", "I routinely recommend that all of my chronic pain patients have\ntheir iron level, total iron binding capacity (TIBC), and ferritinlevels checked. Even if a person\u2019s iron level is suboptimal but stillnormal, that person will often feel fatigue and pain, despite testresults saying that the person is not anemic. Signi\ufb01cant iron de\ufb01-ciency symptoms can often occur with a low \u201cnormal\u201d iron level.Because of this, anyone whose ferritin level is below 40, or whosepercentage iron saturation (TIBC) is less than 22 percent, shouldbe given a trial treatment of iron therapy.\nVitamin B 12.Vitamin B 12is another key nutrient. T echnically, the\nB\u2081\u2082level is normal if it is over 208 picograms per deciliter (pg/dL)\nof blood. However, studies have shown that people can suffersevere and sometimes long-term nerve and brain dysfunctionfrom B \u2081\u2082de\ufb01ciency, even if their levels are as high as 300 pg/dL.\nWhy are the \u201cnormal\u201d levels set so low? In part, the normal val-ues were initially set according to what prevents anemia. How-ever, the needs of brains and nervous systems for vitamin B \u2081\u2082are\noften much higher than those of the bone marrow. Also, as muchas I hate to admit it, medical schools have greatly enjoyed pokingfun at the old-time doctors who gave vitamin B \u2081\u2082shots for fatigue.\nThe use of B \u2081\u2082shots despite \u201cnormal\u201d blood levels is considered\nalmost a symbol of unscienti\ufb01c, archaic medicine. As noted in aneditorial in the New England Journal of Medicine , however, current\n\ufb01ndings suggest that those old-time doctors may have been right.In addition, a recent study using the respected Framingham data-base showed that evidence of B \u2081\u2082de\ufb01ciency occurs even with lev-\nels over 500 pg/dL. I suspect, though, that the modern medicalestablishment will be a little slow to eat crow.\nIt is no surprise, then, when their other problems are also\ntreated, many people respond dramatically to B \u2081\u2082injections. In\naddition to fatigue, it can be very helpful for nerve pain,migraines, and other problems. If a patient\u2019s B \u2081\u2082level is under\n540 pg/mL, I treat that person with a 1 cc (1,000 to 3,000 mcg)injection of vitamin B \u2081\u2082one to \ufb01ve times a week, for \ufb01fteen injec-GENERAL PRINCIPLES OF PAIN RELIEF\n12", "tions. These shots are very safe and fairly inexpensive. Usually, if\na patient is going to bene\ufb01t from the shots, I see improvement byten weeks. But if a patient feels worse when the injections arestopped, I resume giving the shots, usually giving one every oneto \ufb01ve weeks (but as often as three to four times a week in somecases) for an extended period of time. Most people can maintainexcellent B \u2081\u2082levels by taking the 500 micrograms of B \u2081\u2082in the\nEnergy Revitalization System.\nOther B Vitamins. Vitamins B \u2081, B \u2082, B \u2086, and B \u2081\u2082have been found\nto be clinically effective in helping a number of chronic pain con-ditions, including low back pain, migraines, sciatica, trigeminalneuralgia, and diabetic neuropathy. Now researchers at the ParkerInstitute in Dallas have conducted a study suggesting that thesevitamins may also help treat painful sprains, old fractures, burns,and bruises. The study suggests that B vitamins may possess theability to block a certain type of pain receptor, especially inpatients with neuropathic pain.\nMagnesium. Magnesium is probably the single most important\nnutrient for pain relief. It is involved in hundreds of differentfunctions and is routinely low in the American diet as a result offood processing. The average American diet supplies less than 300milligrams (mg) of magnesium per day, while the average Asiandiet supplies over 600 mg per day. I generally recommend taking900 mg of malic acid and 150 to 200 mg of magnesium glycinatea day (both present in the vitamin powder). If diarrhea andcramps are not a problem, you can take up to 500 mg of magne-sium daily. If you get uncomfortable diarrhea from the magne-sium, cut the dosage back and then slowly increase the dose as iscomfortable.\nIf your body\u2019s magnesium stores are low, your muscles will stay\nin spasm and your pain will not resolve. This is one of the reasonsthat taking magnesium is so critical. In addition, magnesium isimportant for your muscle and body strength and energy. Most ofGIVING YOUR BODY WHAT IT NEEDS TO HEAL YOUR PAIN\n13", "your magnesium is inside your cells, and the blood tests only mea-\nsure the magnesium in your blood, making blood tests an unreli-able measure. Almost everyone with pain should take magnesium,but if you have kidney failure discuss your dosage and regimenwith your physician. Magnesium absorption is very dif\ufb01cult,which is why I like to use the glycinate form. Plain magnesiumoxide is also available and is the most inexpensive form of mag-nesium, but your body may not absorb it well. If you choose totake magnesium oxide, take 500 mg per day.\nIn addition to helping muscle pain when taken by mouth or\nintravenously, intravenous (and often oral) magnesium has otherbene\ufb01ts as well. T wo grams of intravenous magnesium given overa few minutes will routinely knock out an acute migraine. Inaddition, it is very good for esophageal spasms and for preventingkidney stones.\nCalcium. Most people do not need calcium supplementation, and\n(as is the case with iron) taking it at the same time as a thyroidhormone will block the thyroid hormone\u2019s absorption. Some peo-ple\u2019s pain improves with taking calcium, and others get worse. Inaddition, calcium is best taken with meals to enhance absorption,and at night as it also helps sleep.\nMost calcium tablets are made of calcium carbonate (chalk)\nand often will not dissolve in the stomach. They then go out inthe stool, having done no good along the way. It is better to usechewable calcium or other forms of calcium such as calcium cit-rate or chelates, taking 500 to 600 mg at bedtime and perhaps thesame amount at dinner. This is most important, however, inwomen over forty years old. Although calcium gets much atten-tion in the treatment of osteoporosis, other nutrients are as, ormore, important (see Chapter 6). In fact, countries with the high-est calcium intakes often have the highest rates of osteoporosis.\nVitamin C and Vitamin D. In a study of 324 patients with arthritis\nof the knee, those taking over 200 mg a day of vitamin C had lesspain than those taking smaller amounts. One epidemiologic studyGENERAL PRINCIPLES OF PAIN RELIEF\n14", "also suggested that taking vitamin C may prevent the development\nof pain and worsening of the arthritis as seen on x-ray.\nAnother problem is that people tend to get most of their vita-\nmin D from exposure to sunlight, and, unfortunately, Americanshave been misled into thinking that sunshine is bad for them.Most of the skin cancers that are caused by excess sun exposureare not especially dangerous and are easy to treat. Some doctorsalso think that the rise in dangerous skin cancers (melanomas) isalso associated with excess sun exposure. I do not believe this isthe case, as most melanomas occur in clothed areas that are notexposed to the sun. As time goes on, I think we\u2019ll \ufb01nd that theincrease in this single type of dangerous skin cancer is largelycaused by other factors besides sunshine. Dr. Michael Holick,director of the vitamin D research lab at Boston University Med-ical Center, thinks that \u201cthe current message that all unprotectedsun exposure is bad for you is too extreme . . . the original mes-sage was that people should limit their sun exposure, not that theyshould avoid the sun entirely. I do believe that some unprotectedexposure to the sun is important for health.\u201d This is supported byevidence that vitamin D de\ufb01ciency can contribute to many can-cers including prostate, colon, and breast cancer. Dr. Holick feelsthat vitamin D may also help protect against heart disease, autoim-mune disease, and even type 1 diabetes. For example, multiplesclerosis is mostly seen in northern latitudes where people get lesssunshine. Now we are also \ufb01nding that vitamin D de\ufb01ciency maycontribute to unexplained muscle and bone pain. In a study of 150children and adults with unexplained muscle and bone pain,almost all were found to be vitamin D de\ufb01cient\u2014with manybeing severely de\ufb01cient with very low vitamin D levels.\nThe RDA (which I feel is often inadequate) for vitamin D is\n200 to 400 IU/day for most people. One glass of forti\ufb01ed milk ororange juice has approximately 100 units of vitamin D, and mostmultivitamins have 400 units or less. T o put it in perspective, alight-skinned person wearing a swimsuit at the beach will getabout 20,000 units of vitamin D in the time it takes his or her skinto get lightly pink.GIVING YOUR BODY WHAT IT NEEDS TO HEAL YOUR PAIN\n15", "Copper. This nutrient is a double-edged sword. Because copper\nis pro-in\ufb02ammatory, it can aggravate arthritis and many otherin\ufb02ammatory and autoimmune processes. On the other hand,copper de\ufb01ciency can contribute to de\ufb01ciencies of a criticalantioxidant called superoxide dismutase. The bottom line is thatit\u2019s good to get just a tiny bit of copper. T o be on the safe side, Irecommend approximately 0.5 mg a day.\nEssential Fatty Acids. Although we get excessive fat in the Ameri-\ncan diet, most of it is not the type that our bodies need. Y our bodyneeds speci\ufb01c fats for proper hormonal and cell function. For exam-ple, the omega-3 fatty acids found in \ufb01sh oils are anti-in\ufb02ammatoryand can be helpful in rheumatoid arthritis and other types of pain.As a fringe bene\ufb01t, high intakes of \ufb01sh oil are associated with adecreased risk of Alzheimer\u2019s disease and cognitive impairment.\nBecause of the cost, I do not routinely recommend essential\nfatty acid supplementation for everyone. If you have dry eyes ordry mouth, however, this suggests essential fatty acid de\ufb01ciencies,especially of the oils found in \ufb01sh. For years I would only use\ufb02axseed oil (which is poorly converted to the type of omega-3fatty acids found in \ufb01sh) because most \ufb01sh oils contain toxins suchas mercury and lead and are also rancid. Fortunately, there arenow a few brands of \ufb01sh oil that have no mercury or toxins andare not rancid. T wo brands of \ufb01sh oil that I recommend areEskimo 3 and Nordic Naturals. Take one to three teaspoons (orthree to nine capsules) a day for nine months if you have dry eyesor dry mouth\u2014symptoms that are suggestive of this de\ufb01ciency.\nNutrients That Help Both Pain and Energy\nThere are a number of nutrients that can be very helpful for bothpain and energy, but which are not in my vitamin powder. Theseoften are only needed for four to eight months, but can be veryhelpful. I recommend you take all three of these for at least threemonths.GENERAL PRINCIPLES OF PAIN RELIEF\n16", "D-Ribose. This excellent nutrient is a key building block for mak-\ning energy and can be very helpful in decreasing both pain andfatigue. The early results that I have seen have been so impressivethat we are now in the process of doing a study on it in ourresearch center. Ribose comes as a sweet-tasting powder that canbe used like sugar and is available in a product called Corvalen byValen Labs. I recommend taking one scoop (5 grams) three timesa day for three weeks, and then one scoop twice a day. After threemonths, you can stop it to see if it is still needed. Results are usu-ally seen within a month.\nAcetyl-L-Carnitine. Acetyl-L-carnitine is critical for both energy\nproduction and the ability to lose weight, and I suspect that thisde\ufb01ciency is an important cause of the average thirty-two-poundweight gain that is seen with CFS and \ufb01bromyalgia. Take one 500mg capsule twice a day for three months; then reduce to 250 to500 mg once a day or stop it.\nCoenzyme Q10. This nutrient is especially important for anyone\nwho is taking cholesterol-lowering prescriptions (such as Meva-cor), which can often cause or aggravate muscle pain. Take 200mg (I use the Vitaline brand) once a day with a meal that has fat,with oil supplements, or in an oil-based form to improve absorp-tion. This supplement helps your body produce energy.\nThe Importance of a Healthy Diet\nAlthough I strongly recommend taking nutritional supplements toensure obtaining the necessary nutrients, I also want to stress thateating a good healthy diet is important. Eat a lot of whole grains,fresh fruits (whole fruit, not fruit juice), and fresh vegetables. Manyraw vegetables have enzymes that improve digestion and help todecrease pain. Y ou do not have to cut out all foods that might be\u201cbad\u201d or eat a diet that is impossible to follow. All you need to dois eat a diet that is reasonably healthy and low in added sugar.GIVING YOUR BODY WHAT IT NEEDS TO HEAL YOUR PAIN\n17", "When I tell people to cut out sugar, I like to add the three magic\nwords \u201cexcept for chocolate\u201d! I consider chocolate to be a healthyfood. T o have your cake and eat it too (so to speak), consider sugar-free chocolates. Some are awful but others are spectacular. RussellStover has a whole line of sugar-free chocolates that are outstand-ing. There are many healthy sugar substitutes. Stevia is excellent,healthy, and easy to use. The best tasting brands of stevia I\u2019ve foundare from Body Ecology and Stevita (see Appendix B or vitality101.com). Many others are bitter. Inositol (which helps anxiety andnerve pain) and xylitol (which decreases osteoporosis) look and tastejust like sugar. Saccharin (which comes in the pink packets) is alsoOK, but because of safety concerns I do not recommend aspartame(NutraSweet). Some sugar substitutes (although not stevia, saccha-rin, or Splenda) can cause gas or diarrhea.\nIn addition, most Americans are chronically dehydrated, and\nthis can make you feel worse as well. I do not recommend thatyou count glasses of water; this is an annoying way to spend a day.Simply check in with your mouth and lips every so often. If theyare dry, you are dehydrated and need to drink more water.\nThe more unprocessed your diet is, the healthier you will be.\nOn the other hand, things that give you pleasure and make youfeel good are generally good for you (contrary to popular belief ).Y our body will tell you what\u2019s good for you by making you feelgood.\nSleep: The Foundation of Pain Relief\nT o eliminate muscle and many other sources of pain, it is criticalto get eight to nine hours of solid, deep sleep each night on aregular basis. Disordered sleep is, in my opinion, a major under-lying process that perpetuates pain. Inadequate sleep can occur fora number of reasons. Many Americans simply do not makeenough time for adequate sleep. A hundred years ago, the averageAmerican was getting nine hours of sleep a night. Anthropolo-gists tell us that \ufb01ve thousand years ago, the average night\u2019s sleepwas eleven to twelve hours a night. When the sun went down, itGENERAL PRINCIPLES OF PAIN RELIEF\n18", "was dark, boring, and dangerous outside, so people went to bed.\nWhen the sun came up, they woke up. The use of candles initiallyshortened sleep time. Then light bulbs were developed, followedby radio, TV , computers, and so on. We are now down to an aver-age of six and a half to seven hours of sleep a night, and this issimply not adequate to allow proper tissue repair.\nSome people get inadequate sleep because of poor sleep\nhygiene, often occurring because pain keeps them awake. Othershave insomnia because the sleep center in the brain (called thehypothalamus) is suppressed by the same process that is causingthe pain. A poll conducted by the National Sleep Foundationfound that 58 percent of Americans had sleep dif\ufb01culties. This hadincreased from 51 percent the year before. In addition, 15 percentof Americans use a prescription or over-the-counter sleep aid, andthose who slept less than six hours a night felt more stressed,angry, sad, and tired than the people who got more sleep. The sur-vey also found that only 30 percent of people reported getting therecommended eight hours of sleep a night, down from 38 percentthe year before.\nKey Stages of Sleep for Pain Relief\nSleep has a distinct architecture with key stages. Stages 1 and 2sleep are fairly light, while stages 3 and 4 sleep (also called deltawave sleep) are the deeper stages of sleep. My experience, and thatof many other clinicians, suggests that what is de\ufb01cient in\ufb01bromyalgia and likely in many pain patients are the deeper,restorative stages of sleep (stages 3 and 4). These are the stages inwhich you produce growth hormone, which results in tissuerepair and healing. Unfortunately, most sleeping pills in commonuse keep people in light stage 2 sleep, which can actually maketheir problem worse. The good news is that there are a number ofexceptions.\nSeveral studies have shown that if you continually wake peo-\nple up whenever they go into deep sleep, or even shake themlightly so that they go from deep sleep into light sleep, they willdevelop pain within one to two weeks and often within oneGIVING YOUR BODY WHAT IT NEEDS TO HEAL YOUR PAIN\n19", "night. In fact, inadequate sleep has repeatedly been shown to con-\ntribute to pain. In a study of \ufb01bromyalgia patients, it was foundthat increased pain sensitivity is associated with greater sleep dis-turbance. Another study of female of\ufb01ce employees in one largecompany showed that women who suffer from frequent musclepain also have insuf\ufb01cient sleep.\nI \ufb01nd that when my patients get eight to nine hours of solid\nsleep regularly each night for six to nine months, their pain and,interestingly, their inability to fall asleep both resolve. They arethen able to markedly reduce the amount of sleep and pain med-ications that they need. Breaking the cycle of poor sleep andmaintaining quality sleep for at least six to nine months is criticalto breaking the cycle of pain. Eight to nine hours of solid sleepeach night without waking or hangover is the goal and, hard asthis may be to believe, it is very attainable using the suggestionsthat I will give you in this chapter.\nNatural Sleep Aids\nIn general, I think it is a good idea to begin with natural reme-dies and good sleep hygiene. Y ou may, however, have a problemwith your sleep center (the hypothalamus) not working or withthe pain simply keeping you awake at night. Because of this, inlight of how critical it is that you get eight to nine hours of solidsleep a night, I would strongly encourage you to add prescriptiontherapies if the natural approaches are not adequate. This willmake a big difference in making your pain go away, and you canusually decrease or come off the prescriptions about six monthsafter you are feeling better.\nI recommend the following natural sleep aids:\n\u2022Revitalizing Sleep Formula\u2014a mix of six sleep herbals\n\u2022Hydroxy L-tryptophan (5-HTP)\u2014aids the body in making\nserotonin\n\u2022Melatonin\u2014a natural hormone\n\u2022Calcium and magnesiumGENERAL PRINCIPLES OF PAIN RELIEF\n20", "Chapter 11 gives complete information on these aids and how to\nuse them. Most of these remedies are not sedating, yet they willhelp you fall asleep and stay in deep sleep.\nAnother natural way to help yourself fall asleep is to play deep-\nsleep\u2013inducing tapes or CDs. If you wake up during the night,you can push your sound system\u2019s replay button. Better yet, get aCD or tape player that can replay continuously throughout thenight. Delta-wave-sleep\u2013inducing tapes and CDs (and the naturalsleep aids) are available online at my website, vitality101.com.\nGood Sleep Hygiene\nThese are some important things to consider that enhance goodsleep hygiene:\n\u2022Do not consume alcohol near bedtime.\n\u2022Do not consume any caffeine after 4:00 p .m.\n\u2022Do not use your bed for problem solving or doing work.\n\u2022Take a hot bath before bed.\n\u2022Keep your bedroom cool.\n\u2022If your partner snores, sleep in a separate bedroom (after\ntucking in or being tucked in by your partner) or get a goodpair of earplugs and use them. The wax plugs that mold tothe shape of the ear are often the best ones.\n\u2022Put the bedroom clock out of arm\u2019s reach and facing away\nfrom you so you can\u2019t see it. Looking at the clock frequentlyaggravates sleep problems and is frustrating.\n\u2022Have a light snack before bedtime. Hunger and\nhypoglycemia cause insomnia in all animals, and humans areno exception. For your snack, eat foods high in the aminoacid tryptophan, such as milk and turkey, which contributeto sleep.\nIf you frequently wake up to urinate during the night, do not\ndrink a lot of \ufb02uids near bedtime. Most pain patients wake duringthe night because their sleep center is not working properly orGIVING YOUR BODY WHAT IT NEEDS TO HEAL YOUR PAIN\n21", "because of the pain. Since they also have a full bladder, they think\nthey are waking up because they have to urinate. This is usuallynot the case. They are waking up because of their pain syndrome.There is a simple way to remedy this problem. If and when youwake up during the night and you notice your bladder is full, justtalk to it (in your mind, so your spouse doesn\u2019t think you\u2019re crazy)and tell it to go back to sleep\u2014you\u2019ll pee in the morning. If youstill have to urinate \ufb01ve minutes later, go to the bathroom. Y ouwill most likely \ufb01nd that your bladder will happily go back tosleep, and when you wake up in the morning, you won\u2019t evenhave to urinate as badly as you did when you woke up in the mid-dle of the night.\nSleep Medications\nAlthough I much prefer natural remedies to prescription medica-tions, natural remedies do not solve sleep problems for everyone,and it may be necessary to use a prescription sleep medication.(See Chapter 13 for a detailed discussion of prescription sleepmedications.) Unfortunately, most sleeping pills in common use(for example, Dalmane, Halcion, and Valium) may actually worsenthe quality of sleep by increasing the amount of light stage (espe-cially stage 2) sleep and decreasing the deep stages of sleep evenfurther. Y ou want to be certain that the treatments and medica-tions you use leave you feeling better the next day, not worse.\nEven if you are someone who needs prescription sleep aids,\nadding natural remedies can be very helpful and usually decreasesthe amount of medication that you will need, resulting in fewerside effects. By using a combination of the treatments discussed,almost all people, even those with chronic pain, can get eight tonine hours of solid sleep a night. It usually takes trial and error to\ufb01nd out exactly what is best for you, but it is worth being persis-tent. In addition, once you come off the sleep medications (usu-ally after nine to eighteen months, although they can be usedinde\ufb01nitely if needed) you may \ufb01nd that all you require are thenatural remedies. Whatever treatments you use, though, it isGENERAL PRINCIPLES OF PAIN RELIEF\n22", "important that they not only increase the duration of sleep but\nalso maintain or improve the deep stages (stages 3 and 4) of sleep.\nIt is not uncommon to see your sleep worsen again (even if\nyou\u2019ve been feeling better) during periods of increased stress\u2014whether physical or emotional\u2014and the \ufb02aring of your illness.During these times, increase the treatments for as long as you needso that you get eight hours of solid sleep a night, and then taperthem or stop them when the problem is resolved. The best way toneed less medication in the long run is to use as much as it takesto get eight to nine hours of solid sleep each night without wak-ing or feeling hungover for six to eighteen months.\nMany people, because of fear of addiction and concern about\nhaving to use constantly escalating doses of sleeping pills, areafraid to take enough medication to get adequate sleep. If I havea patient who has been feeling better and then \ufb01nds that his or herpain is coming back, one of the \ufb01rst things I ask is, \u201cHow is yoursleep?\u201d The usual answer is, \u201cNot good.\u201d However, they are sograteful to get \ufb01ve hours of sleep a night that they settle for it.That\u2019s a bad idea! I recommend taking whatever you need to geteight to nine hours of solid sleep. Y ou\u2019ll be very happy you did.\nTreating Hormonal De\ufb01ciencies\nOur hormonal system regulates our body\u2019s metabolism. Althoughmost hormonal de\ufb01ciencies (and sometimes excesses) can causepain, the key players are hypothyroidism, inadequate adrenalfunction, and low growth hormone. In addition, if your painbegan from ages forty to sixty, it is worth considering low testos-terone in men and low estrogen or testosterone in women. Recentpress reports about problems with Premarin (an estrogen productextracted from pregnant horses\u2019 urine) were no surprise. Manydoctors have been saying for over a decade that it is insane for peo-ple to take Premarin as these estrogens are markedly differentfrom the ones your body makes. We will discuss ways to giveestrogen therapy that can be much safer and may actually decreaseGIVING YOUR BODY WHAT IT NEEDS TO HEAL YOUR PAIN\n23", "the risk of developing cancer. For now, however, let\u2019s begin with\nhypothyroidism\u2014a condition in which the thyroid gland fails toproduce enough thyroid hormone and the most important hor-monal trigger for chronic pain.\nHypothyroidism\nThe thyroid gland, located in the neck area, is the body\u2019s gaspedal, regulating the body\u2019s metabolic speed. If the thyroid glandproduces insuf\ufb01cient amounts of thyroid hormones, metabolismdecreases and the person will be in pain. As I mentioned earlier,it is not uncommon for chronic pain patients to put on twenty to\ufb01fty pounds during the \ufb01rst years of their illness. In addition tonerve, muscle, ligament/tendon, and other pains, other symptomsof hypothyroidism include fatigue, infertility, weight gain, \u201cbrainfog,\u201d constipation, and intolerance to cold.\nWhy Hypothyroidism May Go Undiagnosed. Modern medicine has\ngone through many generations of thyroid tests, and with each newtest, we found that we missed an enormous number of cases ofhypothyroidism. T o make matters more dif\ufb01cult, if the thyroid isunderactive because the hypothalamus is suppressed (as is commonin chronic pain), the TSH test, which is the test most often used,may appear to be normal, or even suggest an overactive thyroid.\nUnfortunately, our current thyroid testing will miss most\npatients with an underactive thyroid. Once again, doctors ofdecades ago were on target when they knew that one has to treatthe patient and not the blood test. In fact, in November 2002 theAmerican Academy of Clinical Endocrinologists again changedthe normal range on the TSH thyroid blood test (so that a TSHover 3 warranted treatment), increasing the number of patientswith hypothyroidism in the United States from 13 to 26 million.Less than a quarter of these patients have been properly diagnosedand treated.\nI have found\u2014either through blood testing or according to\nsymptoms\u2014that over 47 percent of my \ufb01bromyalgia patients haveGENERAL PRINCIPLES OF PAIN RELIEF\n24", "a low thyroid and that 83 percent of these patients have improved\nby taking a low dose of thyroid hormone. However, years afterthe new directives have been given, doctors are still largelyunaware of these new lab guidelines for diagnosis and treatment.Even the major labs doing thyroid testing have not bothered tochange the now incorrect normal ranges for both diagnosis andtreatment of thyroid disorders.\nThe Problem with Thyroid Tests. The normal range for most blood\ntests, including thyroid hormone levels, are based on statisticalnorms (called 2 standard deviations). This means that out of everyone hundred people, those with the 2 highest and lowest scoresare de\ufb01ned as abnormal and everyone else is arbitrarily consideredto be normal. That means if a problem affects over 2 percent ofthe population (as many as 24 percent of women over sixty arehypothyroid and 12 percent of the population have abnormalantibodies attacking their thyroid), then our testing system willmiss most of them. In addition, our testing system does not takebiological individuality into account. T o translate how poorly this\u201c2 percent equals abnormal\u201d system works, consider this: if weapplied this approach to getting you a pair of shoes, any sizebetween a 4 and 13 would be \u201cmedically normal.\u201d If a man wasaccidentally given a size 5 shoe or a woman a size 12, the doctorwould say that the shoe sizes they were given are \u201cnormal,\u201d andthere is no problem!\nSimply changing the normal range for the TSH test to less than\n3 increased the number of Americans with thyroid illness from13 million to 26 million. Unfortunately, over 13 million Ameri-cans with thyroid disease remain undiagnosed, and the majorityof those receiving treatment are not being dosed appropriately.Doctors do not know that they have not been adequately trainedin the proper diagnosis or treatment of hypothyroidism, and thecost in human life and devastating illness is enormous. Whatmakes this especially tragic is how easy treatment is if doctors aregiven and use the correct information.GIVING YOUR BODY WHAT IT NEEDS TO HEAL YOUR PAIN\n25", "The Potential Cost of Missing Hypothyroidism. A study in the\nprestigious Annals of Internal Medicine noted that hypothyroidism\n\u201ccontributed to 60 percent of cases of myocardial infarction [heartattacks] among women affected by subclinical [even mild] hypo-thyroidism.\u201d It contributed more to causing heart attacks in thesepatients than smoking, elevated cholesterol, high blood pressure,or diabetes. As a result, there may be over thirty thousand pre-ventable deaths per year from heart attacks as women withuntreated hypothyroidism are more than twice as likely to have aheart attack.\nIn addition, 6 percent of miscarriages are associated with\nhypothyroidism with 4,600 miscarriages per year after \ufb01fteenweeks of pregnancy and countless more before. Undiagnosedhypothyroidism is also associated with infertility. In moderate toseverely hypothyroid mothers, the baby was also over six times aslikely to die soon after being born. In addition, children born tohypothyroid mothers have a lower IQ by an average of 7 points.They are almost four times as likely to have an IQ under 85 andover twice as likely to have learning dif\ufb01culties resulting in theirhaving to repeat a grade.\nOver six million Americans have \ufb01bromyalgia, and tens of\nmillions more have chronic muscle pain. Undiagnosed or inade-quately treated thyroid disorders contribute to these unnecessar-ily disabling conditions.\nAs I mentioned earlier, hypothyroidism is a major cause of\ngaining and being unable to lose weight. It also causes fatigue, dryhair, coarse skin, depression, and \u201cbrain fog\u201d as well. As a result,hypothyroidism is often confused with depression and can be mis-takenly treated with Prozac. This is an even bigger problem in theelderly who are being misdiagnosed with depression or Alz-heimer\u2019s/senility when what they have is hypothyroidism.\nFortunately, given the proper information, hypothyroidism\ncan be incredibly easy and inexpensive to diagnose and treat.Sadly, because of lack of awareness and open-mindedness on theGENERAL PRINCIPLES OF PAIN RELIEF\n26", "part of our medical community, Americans still unnecessarily suf-\nfer from a major public health disaster.\nTreating an Underactive Thyroid. If you have chronic pain and suf-\nfer from even two of the following symptoms, you should con-sider asking your doctor to prescribe a low dose of thyroidhormone.\n\u2022Chronic fatigue\n\u2022Heavy periods\n\u2022Constipation\n\u2022Easy weight gain\n\u2022Cold intolerance\n\u2022Dry skin\n\u2022Thin hair\n\u2022A body temperature that tends to be under 98.6\u00b0\nIn addition, family members of those with a low thyroid have about\na 50 percent chance of also getting it. If your doctor won\u2019t prescribethyroid hormone, you may wish to consult one who is open to theidea (see Appendix B). Before seeing a new doctor, call and ask ifhe or she sometimes treats people with thyroid hormone despite theblood tests being normal if their symptoms show they need it. Aslong as you do not have underlying angina/heart disease and youfollow up with a blood test to make sure that your free T4 bloodtest (do not use TSH) thyroid levels are in a safe range (going abovethe upper limit of normal may aggravate osteoporosis), a trial oflow-dose thyroid hormone treatment is usually safe and may be dra-matically bene\ufb01cial.\nSome patients have found desiccated thyroid (Armour Thy-\nroid) to be helpful and the synthetic thyroid (Synthroid) not tobe. Some have found the opposite. What is important to know isthat if you have muscle or nerve pain and an underactive thyroidthat is not treated (even if your blood tests come back normal),GIVING YOUR BODY WHAT IT NEEDS TO HEAL YOUR PAIN\n27", "these pains simply will not resolve. Many experts on chronic pain\nagree.\nThyroid treatment despite normal tests is very controversial,\neven though it\u2019s usually very safe. All treatments (even aspirin) cancause problems in some people. Thyroid treatment can triggercaffeine-like anxiety or palpitations. If this happens, cut back thedose and increase by one-half to one 30 mg or 50 mcg tablet eachtwo to eight weeks as is comfortable. Sometimes taking 500 mgof vitamin B \u2081(thiamine) one to three times a day (as in the Calm-\ning Balance Formula) will also help prevent the anxiety afterabout two weeks. If you have severe, persistent racing heart, callyour family doctor and/or go to a hospital emergency room.\nLike exercise (such as climbing steps), if one is on the edge of\nhaving a heart attack or severe \u201cracing heart\u201d (atrial \ufb01brillation),thyroid hormone can trigger these occurrences. However,research suggests that thyroid hormone treatments may actuallydecrease the risk of heart disease. If you have chest pain, go to thehospital emergency room and/or call your family doctor. It willlikely be chest muscle pain (not dangerous), but better safe thansorry. To put it in perspective, I\u2019ve never seen this happen in mydecades of treating thousands of patients with thyroid hormone. \nIncreasing your thyroid hormone dose to levels above the upper\nlimit of the normal range may accelerate osteoporosis, which isalready common in those with chronic pain. Because of this, youneed to check your thyroid (free T4, not TSH) blood levels afterfour to eight weeks on your optimum dose of thyroid hormone. I\ufb01nd treatments with thyroid hormone safer than aspirin andMotrin. If you have chest pain or risk factors for angina, do anexercise stress test to make sure your heart is healthy before begin-ning thyroid hormone treatment. Risk factors for angina includediabetes, elevated cholesterol, hypertension, smoking, personal orfamily history of angina, gout, and age over \ufb01fty years old.\nWe are constantly learning powerful new tricks for treat-\ning hypothyroidism, and there are many reasonable treatmentGENERAL PRINCIPLES OF PAIN RELIEF\n28", "approaches. I would recommend starting with a trial of Armour\nThyroid. (More information is available at my website, vitality101.com.)\nAdrenal Insuf\ufb01ciency\nThe adrenal glands, which sit on top of the kidneys, are actuallytwo different glands in one. Both parts are critical to your stressresponse system. The center of the gland makes adrenaline (epi-nephrine). The outer part of the adrenal gland, called the cor-tex, also makes many important hormones (including cortisol,DHEA-S, and testosterone).\n\u2022Cortisol. The adrenal glands increase their production of\ncortisol in response to stress. Cortisol raises the blood sugarand blood pressure levels and moderates immune function,in addition to playing numerous other roles. If your cortisollevel is low, you may have fatigue, low blood pressure,hypoglycemia, poor immune function, an increasedtendency to allergies and environmental sensitivity, and aninability to deal with stress. Inadequate cortisol canmarkedly increase pain by hindering your body\u2019s ability todeal with in\ufb02ammation. In addition, recurrent drops inblood sugar (hypoglycemia) can constantly throw yourmuscles into spasm.\n\u2022Dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEA-S). Although\nits mechanism of action is not clear, DHEA is the mostabundant hormone produced by the adrenal cortex. If it islow, you will often feel unwell. Patients often feeldramatically better when their DHEA-S levels are broughtto the midnormal range for a twenty-nine-year-old.DHEA-S levels normally decline with age and often dropprematurely in \ufb01bromyalgia patients. DHEA has been calledthe \u201cfountain of youth\u201d hormone. This is because gray hairsometimes returns to its original color when one takesGIVING YOUR BODY WHAT IT NEEDS TO HEAL YOUR PAIN\n29", "DHEA. In fact, I didn\u2019t realize that my nephews thought I\nwas dying my hair for years (I would never dye my hair\u2014Ilike the salt-and-pepper look) because my normal hair colorwould return when I took DHEA!\n\u2022Testosterone. This hormone is produced in small but\nsigni\ufb01cant amounts by the adrenals as well as by the ovariesand testicles.\nCauses of Adrenal Insuf\ufb01ciency. I suspect that many people have\nadrenal burnout. Dr. Hans Selye, one of the \ufb01rst doctors toresearch stress reactions, found that if an animal becomes severelyoverstressed, its adrenal glands bleed and develop signs of adrenaldestruction before the animal \ufb01nally dies from the stress.\nIf you think back to your biology classes in high school, you\nmay remember something called the \u201c\ufb01ght-or-\ufb02ight response.\u201dThis is a physical reaction that occurs during times of stress. Dur-ing the Stone Age, when a caveman met an animal that wanted toeat him, the caveman\u2019s adrenal glands activated multiple systemsin his body that prompted him to either \ufb01ght or run. This reac-tion helped the caveman survive. In those days, however, peopleprobably had a couple of weeks or months to recover before fac-ing the next major stress. That is no longer the case. In today\u2019ssociety, especially with chronic pain, people often experiencestress reactions every few minutes.\nI suspect that many people suffer exhaustion of their adrenal\nglands. With the kinds of stresses common in modern society, aperson\u2019s adrenal test may initially show hormonal levels that areactually higher than usual, since the adrenal gland tends to over-compensate to deal with stress. Over time, this may exhaust theadrenal reserve, that is, the adrenal\u2019s ability to increase hormoneproduction in response to stress. Both high and low cortisol cancontribute to weight gain. In endocrinologist Dr. William Jef-feries\u2019 experience (and in mine as well), people with either lowhormone production or a low reserve often respond dramaticallyto treatment with low doses of adrenal hormones.GENERAL PRINCIPLES OF PAIN RELIEF\n30", "Symptoms of Adrenal Insuf\ufb01ciency. If your adrenal glands are\nunderactive, what symptoms might you experience? Low adrenalfunction can cause, among other symptoms:\n\u2022Pain and fatigue\n\u2022Recurrent infections\n\u2022\u201cCrashing\u201d during stress\n\u2022Hypoglycemia (irritability when hungry)\n\u2022Low blood pressure and dizziness upon \ufb01rst standing\nHypoglycemia deserves special mention. Many people become\nshaky and nervous, then dizzy, irritable, and fatigued when theyget hungry. They then often feel better after they eat sweets,which improve their energy and mood for a short period of time.Because of this, these people often crave sugar, not realizing thatit makes their blood sugar level initially shoot back up to normal,which is what makes them feel better, but then continue to soarbeyond normal. The body responds to this by driving the sugarlevel back down below normal again. The effect, energy-wise, islike a roller coaster.\nDr. Jefferies has noted\u2014and again, my experience con\ufb01rms\nhis \ufb01nding\u2014that most people with hypoglycemia have underac-tive adrenal glands. This makes sense because the adrenal glands\u2019responsibilities include maintaining blood sugar at an adequatelevel. Sugar is the only fuel that the brain can use. When people\u2019sblood sugar level drops, they can feel poorly and it can \ufb02are theirpain. I recommend diagnosing hypoglycemia based on symptoms.Like other tests of hormonal function, I consider glucose toler-ance tests to be incredibly unreliable.\nTreating Adrenal Insuf\ufb01ciency. People with hypoglycemia can treat\nlow blood sugar symptoms by cutting sugar and caffeine out oftheir diets; having frequent, small meals; and increasing theirintake of proteins and vegetables.

Taking 250 micrograms of chromium a day (present in thevitamin powder) for six months often helps smooth out hypo-glycemic symptoms.\nTreating the underactive adrenal problem usually banishes the\nsymptoms of low blood sugar. Y ou can begin with adrenal glan-dulars combined with licorice and key nutrients (all present inAdrenal Stress End, which I helped to formulate). In addition yourdoctor may consider using prescription hydrocortisone, such asCortef. (See vitality101.com for further information.) When usedin doses of 20 mg or less a day, Cortef is usually quite safe and canresult in a dramatic decrease in many types of pain. Interestingly,some doctors are using microdose Cortef therapy for arthritis.Although some doctors may charge four thousand dollars to pre-scribe this simple and inexpensive treatment, your doctor couldprescribe it for free!\nCortisone Treatment and Toxicity\nAdrenal hormones are essential for life. Without them, a persondies. But, as with any hormone, too much can be dangerous. Inthe early studies using adrenal hormones, the researchers had noidea what dose was normal and what was toxic. When they gaveinjections of the hormone to patients, the patients\u2019 arthritis wentaway and they felt better. However, because they gave patientsmany times more than the normal amount, the patients becametoxic and died. Because of this, the researchers became frightenedand avoided using adrenal hormones whenever possible. Medicalstudents were taught to avoid adrenal hormones unless no othertreatment choices existed.\nThe use of adrenal hormones needs to be put into perspective,\nhowever. Imagine if the early thyroid researchers had given theirpatients \ufb01fty times the usual dose of thyroid hormone. Thyroidpatients would have routinely died of heart attacks. The thyroidresearchers, however, were fortunate enough to stumble upon theGENERAL PRINCIPLES OF PAIN RELIEF\n32", "body\u2019s healthy dose early on and to skip these negative outcomes.\nIf they had not, people today would not be treated for an under-active thyroid until they displayed symptoms of very advancedthyroid disease (myxedema) and were nearly comatose. Medicalscience is just beginning to learn that a person can feel horribleand function poorly even with a minimal to moderate hormonede\ufb01ciency. Waiting for the person to go \u201coff the deep end\u201d of thetest\u2019s normal scale is not healthy.\nDr. Jefferies has found that as long as the adrenal hormone level\nis kept within the normal range, the main toxicity that a patientmight experience is a slight upset stomach due to the body notbeing used to having the hormone come in through the stomach.Taking the hormone with food usually helps this. In addition,some patients gain a few pounds. This is because a low adrenal levelcan cause a person\u2019s weight to drop below the body\u2019s normal setpoint, even if that set point is high because of pain or \ufb01bromyal-gia. (The average weight gain in \ufb01bromyalgia is thirty-twopounds.) However, any weight gain often is more than offset bythe weight loss resulting from being able to exercise once again.\nMany physicians do not like to prescribe even low doses of\nadrenal hormone. If your physician is uncomfortable with Cortef,invite him or her to read Dr. Jefferies\u2019 material on the safety oflow-dose cortisone as well as our recent study. Most patients onlyneed 5 to 12.5 mg of Cortef a day, equivalent to 1 to 3 mg a dayof prednisone (a more dangerous and less effective synthetic formof cortisol that your doctor is aware of ), which is a dose so lowthat most doctors have never prescribed it. After feeling well forsix to eighteen months, most people begin to slowly decrease theiradrenal hormone dosage, eventually discontinuing the treatmententirely.\nIf your symptoms started suddenly after a viral infection, if\nyou suffer from hypoglycemia or crash with stress, or if you haverecurrent sore throat or respiratory infections that take a long timeto resolve, you probably have underactive adrenal glands.GIVING YOUR BODY WHAT IT NEEDS TO HEAL YOUR PAIN\n33", "Treating Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) De\ufb01ciency\nThe adrenal gland makes many hormones in addition to hydro-\ncortisone. One of these previously mentioned is DHEA, which isoften very low in chronic pain patients. Although DHEA\u2019s func-tion is not yet fully understood, it appears to be important forgood health, which makes a low DHEA level worth treating.Some studies suggest that the higher a person\u2019s DHEA level is, thelonger that person will live and the healthier he or she will be. I\u2019mconcerned that pushing the blood level above the upper limit ofnormal may slightly increase the risk of breast cancer, so keep itin the normal range. For many patients, when a low DHEA levelis treated, the result is a dramatic boost in well-being and adecrease in pain.\nIf your DHEA-S (not DHEA) blood level is low\u2014under 120\nmicrograms per deciliter (mcg/dL) for females or 325 mcg/dLfor males\u2014I recommend beginning treatment with 5 to 25 mgof DHEA per day and slowly working up to what feels like anoptimal level to you. For women, I suggest keeping the DHEA-Slevel at around 150 to 180 mcg/dL, which is the middle of thenormal range for a twenty-nine-year-old female. For men, I keepthe DHEA-S level between 350 and 500 mcg/dL, which is thenormal range for a twenty-nine-year-old male. The low ends ofthe normal ranges are normal only for people over eighty. If youhave side effects, such as facial hair or acne, which are uncom-mon, check your blood level of DHEA-S and decrease your dose.I have found that many brands of DHEA are not reliable. I rec-ommend you use DHEA made by compounding pharmacists (seeAppendix B) or by General Nutrition Center or other reputablecompanies.\nTreating Low Testosterone: Not Only a Male Problem\nMany people going through midlife develop pain, fatigue, poorlibido, or depression. This includes men and women alike. Anunderactive adrenal gland can aggravate this problem. AlthoughGENERAL PRINCIPLES OF PAIN RELIEF\n34", "the ovaries make most of a woman\u2019s estrogen and the testicles\nmake most of a man\u2019s testosterone, in women the adrenals makesigni\ufb01cant amounts of testosterone.\nInadequate testosterone is a major problem in 70 percent of my\nmale patients with \ufb01bromyalgia and/or chronic pain. It is impor-tant (again, in both men and women) to check the free or unboundblood testosterone level. This measures the active form of the hor-mone. If your result is below normal, or even in the lowest 25 per-cent of the normal range, I would consider a trial of naturaltestosterone therapy.\nLow testosterone is associated with many problems also caused\nby pain, including fatigue, depression, poor stamina, muscle-wasting, osteoporosis, and poor libido. Chronic pain is routinelyassociated with low testosterone, further aggravating these prob-lems. In addition, taking narcotic pain medications also lowerstestosterone. Treating both men and women who have a low tes-tosterone can help all of these conditions.\nA recent study by Dr. Hillary White, an associate professor at\nDartmouth Medical School, found that testosterone replacementtherapy is helpful in the treatment of women with \ufb01bromyalgiapain. Because the study is still awaiting publication, more detailsare not yet available. Dr. White became interested in this problemwhen testosterone helped relieve her own \ufb01bromyalgia pain. Shealso notes that it is important to use natural testosterone and notthe synthetic methyl testosterone form.\nMost studies show that low testosterone in men is associated\nwith an increased risk of angina and that using natural testos-terone to bring low testosterone up to the midnormal leveldecreases angina and leg artery blockages, improves cholesterol,and may decrease diabetic tendencies. It is not clear if takingtestosterone increases the risk of prostate enlargement or cancerbeyond that of any other healthy male.

She notes,appropriately, that the perimenopausal period (the period as youapproach menopause) has a gradual onset, and symptoms of estro-gen de\ufb01ciency can occur \ufb01ve to twelve years before your bloodtests and periods become abnormal.\nIf your pain is worse when your estrogen levels are dropping\n(during ovulation, which occurs about \ufb01fteen days after the \ufb01rstday of your period, and around your period), a trial of naturalestrogen supplementation is warranted. Other symptoms of inad-equate estrogen include inadequate vaginal lubrication, nightsweats, and/or hot \ufb02ashes.\nMost of the media attention and research about estrogen being\ndangerous relate to the use of conjugated estrogens (made usingpregnant horse urine) like Premarin, mentioned at the beginningof this chapter. I prefer to use natural biestrogen (1.25 to 2.5 mga day) from a compounding pharmacy. This contains estradiol plusestriol, a weaker form of estrogen that may actually decrease therisk of developing breast cancer. Patients with estrogen-inducedmigraines usually get them not from the estrogen itself but from\ufb02uctuating blood levels of estrogen. They will often get relief byusing estrogen patches that last for the week around their period.These give steady estrogen levels.GENERAL PRINCIPLES OF PAIN RELIEF\n36", "Unless you have had a hysterectomy, if you take supplemental\nestrogen you must also take progesterone.

Click here for terms of use.  ", "Managing Infections\nMany different kinds of infections can trigger pain. Pain can be\ncaused by direct irritation caused by the infection, but can also becaused by the in\ufb02ammation or immune activation your body cre-ates as it attempts to \ufb01ght the infection\u2014like feeling achiness withthe \ufb02u. In some cases, such as Lyme disease, the role of infectionin causing the pain is fairly well accepted. In many, if not mostcases, however, the role of infections is still controversial as asource of pain. Although it is possible for numerous infections tobe the source of pain, we will focus on the most important ones.\nFungal Infections and Overgrowth\nAlthough many doctors still believe there is no such thing as fun-gal overgrowth, the increase in antibiotic and sugar use in oursociety has made this problem more common. When it affects theskin in athlete\u2019s foot or causes obvious vaginal infections, it can bereadily seen and is therefore accepted by the medical community.Unfortunately, when it affects the bowels and sinuses there is noreliable way to test for it, and many physicians still make believethat fungal overgrowth cannot occur in these areas. It can, how-ever, and it is very important to treat it.\nThere are no de\ufb01nitive tests for yeast overgrowth that will dis-\ntinguish it from normal yeast growth in the body. Nonetheless,fungal/yeast overgrowth should be considered in any of the fol-lowing situations:\n\u2022Chronic sinusitis and nasal congestion\n\u2022Spastic colon, gas, bloating, constipation, and/or diarrhea\n\u2022A history of frequent antibiotic use\n\u2022Recurrent or ongoing skin, nail, or vaginal fungal infections\n\u2022Itchy ears or anus, recurrent aphthous ulcers (painful ulcers\nin the mouth where the lips meet your gums that last for \ufb01veto ten days), and/or sugar cravings\n\u2022The presence of widespread achiness without in\ufb02ammation\n(\ufb01bromyalgia/chronic fatigue syndrome)GENERAL PRINCIPLES OF PAIN RELIEF\n40", "Although people most often speak of Candida as the main type\nof fungal infection, I suspect that these infections can be causedby many different fungi. Although many tests are recommendedto look for these infections, I do not consider them to be morereliable than simply looking for the six things that I noted above.If any of these are present, I believe that an empiric trial of anti-fungal therapy is warranted. Y our body\u2019s response to therapy is thebest indicator of whether fungal overgrowth was a problem. Ifyour symptoms initially worsen with antifungals and/or improvesigni\ufb01cantly by the end of six weeks of treatment (shorter coursesare unlikely to eradicate the problem), this suggests that fungalovergrowth is playing a role in your pain (and perhaps many othersymptoms). A number of very effective methods can be used toeliminate a yeast problem. My preference is to treat with a mix ofnatural and prescription therapies (described later in this section).If your doctor is unwilling to use prescription antifungals, eitherbegin with the natural therapies or look for a doctor who willprescribe them.\nMany physicians feel that yeast overgrowth causes a general-\nized suppression of the immune system. In other words, once theyeast gets the upper hand, it sets up a cycle that further suppressesthe body\u2019s defenses. Interestingly, a recent Mayo Clinic studyshowed that most cases of chronic sinusitis seem to be associatedwith a reaction to yeast in the sinuses\u2014something I proposedyears ago. Nonetheless, as I have already noted, this theory is con-troversial. Y east are normal members of the body\u2019s \u201czoo.\u201d Theylive in balance with bacteria\u2014some of which are helpful andhealthy and some of which are detrimental and unhealthy. Theproblems begin when this harmonious balance shifts and the yeastbegins to overgrow.\nCauses of Fungal Infections. Many things can prompt yeast to\novergrow. One of the most common causes is frequent antibioticuse. Antibiotics kill off the good bacteria in the bowel along withthe bad bacteria. When this happens, the yeast no longer havecompetition and begin to overgrow. The body is often able toELIMINATING THE CAUSES AND TRIGGERS OF YOUR PAIN\n41", "rebalance itself after one or several courses of antibiotics, but after\nrepeated or long-term courses\u2014and especially if the body has anunderlying immune dysfunction\u2014the yeast can get the upperhand.\nOther factors are also important. Studies have shown that ani-\nmals that are sleep-deprived and/or have increased sugar intakedevelop bowel yeast overgrowth. Many physicians feel that eatingsugar stimulates yeast overgrowth in people as well. Sugar is foodfor yeast. Y east ferment sugar in order to grow and multiply. Y eastovergrowth due to the overuse of sugar also seems to causeimmune suppression, which facilitates bacterial infections such aschronic sinusitis, requiring even more antibiotic use. Poor sleepalso results in marked suppression of your immune function.\nTreating Suspected Fungal Overgrowth Naturally. The \ufb01rst thing\nyou need to do is to stop feeding the yeast. Y east grow by eatingsugar and other sweets. Y ou can enjoy one or two pieces of fruita day, but you should not consume concentrated sugar sources suchas juices, corn syrup, jellies, pastry, candy, or honey. Stay far awayfrom soft drinks, which often have ten to twelve teaspoons ofsugar in every twelve ounces. This amount of sugar has beenshown to markedly suppress immune function for several hours.\nUsing stevia as a sweetener is a wonderful substitute for sugar.\nStevia is safe and natural, and you can use all you want. There areeven cookbooks available for using stevia. Most brands are bitter,and I don\u2019t recommend them. T wo brands taste great, however.These are the ones made by Body Ecology or the Stevita Com-pany (see Appendix B or vitality101.com).\nOther healthy natural sweeteners include maltitol (used in\nmany sugar-free chocolates), inositol, and xylitol. The yeast do notappear to be able to ferment these. In addition, inositol candecrease nerve pain and anxiety, and xylitol also appears todecrease osteoporosis. Be prepared to have withdrawal symptomsfor about one week when you cut sugar out of your diet. Severalexcellent books have been written on the yeast controversy andoffer additional dietary methods to try. One of the best is TheGENERAL PRINCIPLES OF PAIN RELIEF\n42", "Yeast Connection and the Woman by Dr. William Crook, a physi-\ncian who did a spectacular job of advancing our understanding ofthe problems caused by fungal overgrowth.\nAcidophilus\u2014milk bacteria, a healthy type of bacteria for the\nbowel\u2014helps restore balance in the bowel. Acidophilus is foundin yogurt with live and active yogurt cultures. Indeed, eating onecup of yogurt a day can markedly diminish the frequency ofrecurrent vaginal yeast infections. Acidophilus is also available inmany forms. Unfortunately, recent tests of many brands showedthat the quality control is very poor. The only forms of aci-dophilus that I currently recommend are those that have a pearlcoating to protect the bacteria and keep them alive such as Aci-dophilus Pearls, Probiotic Pearls, or a product called PrimalDefense. Take two pearls or two Primal Defense tablets twice aday for \ufb01ve months. This will help to restore the healthy bacteriain your colon that were destroyed by antibiotic use. Some peoplelike to continue on one pearl or tablet a day long term to helpmaintain healthy bowel function. If you are on antibiotics (notantifungals), take the acidophilus at least three to six hours awayfrom the antibiotic dose.\nAnother effective natural antifungal is Citricidal. Derived from\ngrapefruit and grapefruit seeds, it can be quite powerful at inhibit-ing fungal growth and the growth of other infections. Take oneor two 100 mg tablets twice a day. Do not use the liquid form, asit tastes vile. Many natural antifungals are available, but using astrong enough dose often causes stomach irritation and re\ufb02ux. Bycombining several antifungals at lower doses, one can increasetheir effectiveness with fewer side effects. Phytostan by NF For-mulas is an excellent mix of natural antifungals. These includegrapefruit seed extract, Pau d\u2019arco, caprylic acid, undecylenic acid,rosemary, and thyme. The recommended dose is one tablet, threetimes a day or two tablets, twice a day.\nMedical Treatments for Yeast Overgrowth. Nystatin, an antifun-\ngal medication, has been helpful in the treatment of yeast over-growth. Unfortunately, some fungi seem to be developingELIMINATING THE CAUSES AND TRIGGERS OF YOUR PAIN\n43", "resistance to nystatin. In addition, nystatin is poorly absorbed,\nwhich means that it has little impact on the yeast outside of thebowel. Other antifungal medications, such as Di\ufb02ucan and Spo-ranox, seem to be effective systemically (throughout the body),but they have two main drawbacks. First, they are expensive, cost-ing more than $450 to $900 for a two-month course. Happily,Di\ufb02ucan just went generic and can now be found for $40 permonth. Second, any effective antifungal can initially make thesymptoms of yeast infection worse. If you get this reaction, startyour treatment with Acidophilus, a sugar-free diet, plus Phytostanfor a few weeks before beginning the Nystatin and Di\ufb02ucan.\nAlthough it is uncommon, Di\ufb02ucan and Sporanox can also\ncause liver in\ufb02ammation. If you are taking Di\ufb02ucan or Sporanoxfor more than six to twelve weeks, I would consider intermittentblood tests to check liver function\u2014speci\ufb01cally checking bloodlevels of ALT and AST, two inexpensive tests and good indicatorsof injury to the liver. If you have preexisting active liver disease,you should be cautious about using Di\ufb02ucan or Sporanox\u2014or donot use them at all.\nI recommend taking 200 to 300 mg of lipoic acid a day when-\never you take Sporanox or Di\ufb02ucan. This is a natural supplementthat helps to protect and heal the liver (and can also be helpful fornerve pain). I also recommend lipoic acid for anyone with nervepain (200 to 300 mg two to three times a day) or active liver dis-ease such as hepatitis (at doses up to 1,000 to 3,000 mg a day) asit may prevent and/or help treat hepatitis and cirrhosis. (Furtherinformation is available at vitality101.com.)\nAvoiding Yeast Overgrowth. The best thing you can do to com-\nbat yeast overgrowth is to avoid it in the \ufb01rst place. When you geta viral infection, immediately begin treating it naturally. (See thesidebar \u201cTreating Respiratory Infections Without Antibiotics.\u201d)Hopefully, you will be able to prevent it from turning into a bac-terial infection that might require an antibiotic. Ask your doctorwhat other measures you can take before resorting to antibiotics.GENERAL PRINCIPLES OF PAIN RELIEF\n44", "ELIMINATING THE CAUSES AND TRIGGERS OF YOUR PAIN\nMany people do not realize how many things they can do before\nresorting to using an antibiotic to clear an infection. If you feel you\nare coming down with a respiratory infection such as a sore throat,\na cold, sinusitis, or the \ufb02u, I recommend that you try the following:\n\u2022Take a natural thymic hormone mimic. This is available as a\nproduct called ProBoost, which is a very effective immunestimulant (see Appendix B). At the \ufb01rst sign of any infection,\ndissolve the contents of one packet under your tongue three\ntimes a day and let it absorb there (any that is swallowed isdestroyed). I have found that using it for two or three days atthe onset of any infection can shorten the length of the\ninfection dramatically and often stops it on the \ufb01rst day.\n\u2022Take 1,000 to 8,000 mg of vitamin C a day. Take enough to get\ndiarrhea; then cut back to a comfortable level.\n\u2022If you have a sore throat, suck on a zinc lozenge \ufb01ve to eight\ntimes a day. Make sure that the lozenges have at least 10 to\n20 mg of zinc per lozenge. Less than this will not be effective.\nZinc lozenges have been known to speed the time it takes to\nrecover from a cold by about 40 percent. The Vitamin Shoppeand General Nutrition Center brands are excellent.\n\u2022Drink plenty of water and hot caffeine-free tea (or hot water\nwith lemon) and rest.\n\u2022Take Oscillococcinum. If you have \ufb02ulike symptoms such as\nchills, fever, achiness, and/or malaise, take Oscillococcinum, a\nhomeopathic remedy available at most health food stores and\nsome supermarkets. It speeds healing and eases discomfort. Itis best taken early in the infection\u2014as soon as you have any\nsymptoms.\n\u2022If you have a sinus infection, try nasal rinses. Dissolve a half\nteaspoon of salt in a cup of lukewarm water. Inhale some of theTreating Respiratory Infections \nWithout Antibiotics\n(continued)\n45", "GENERAL PRINCIPLES OF PAIN RELIEF\nsolution about one inch up into your nose, one nostril at a time.\nDo this either by using a baby nose bulb or an eyedropper\nwhile lying down, or by snif\ufb01ng the solution out of the palm of\nyour hand while standing by a sink. Then gently blow yournose, being careful not to hurt your ears. Repeat the same\nprocess with the other nostril. Continue to repeat with each\nnostril until the nose is clear. Rinse your nasal passages at leasttwice a day until the infection improves. Each rinsing will washaway about 90 percent of the infection and make it much easier\nfor your body to heal. Colloidal silver nose sprays can also help.\nAlso ask your doctor to prescribe the sinusitis nose spray fromCape Pharmacy (listed in Appendix B). In addition, see the\nsection later in this chapter on treating sinusitis.\n\u2022Try using a humidi\ufb01er or vaporizer in your bedroom. You can\nalso make a steam room by running a hot shower in your\nbathroom and then breathing in the steam. Or try using a\nsteam inhaler, such as the one available from BernhardIndustries. This is also wonderful for alleviating chronic andacute sinusitis.\nIf, in spite of these measures, nasal and lung mucus is yellow\nafter seven to fourteen days, or if you are feeling worse after three\nto four days, you may have to consider taking a course of\nantibiotics. If you do, you should take nystatin while on theantibiotic. Erythromycin antibiotics such as azithromycin (Zithromax)\nand clarithromycin (Biaxin) are usually preferable to penicillin\nantibiotics. Interestingly, my patients have sometimes found thatpain and many other symptoms (not just the cold) improve while\nthey are taking an erythromycin or tetracycline antibiotic. If that\nhappens, I recommend a six- to twenty-four-month course ofZithromax 250 mg per day, or 100 mg of doxycycline twice a day. If\nyou feel better on the antibiotic (take thymic hormone/ProBoost,Treating Respiratory Infections \nWithout Antibiotics, continued\n46", "ELIMINATING THE CAUSES AND TRIGGERS OF YOUR PAIN\nand the antifungal nystatin in conjunction with it), keep repeating\ntwelve-week courses until the symptoms stay gone. I would also\ncheck for Lyme disease, although the tests are not reliable. For\nmost of my patients who repeatedly get respiratory infections thatseem to take forever to go away, I consider an empiric trial of\nprescription hydrocortisone (Cortef) at a dosage of 7.5 mg in the\nmorning and 5 mg at noon for two to three months (see the earliersection on adrenal insuf\ufb01ciency).\nTo treat or prevent bladder infections caused by E. coli (the\nmost common cause), use the natural supplement D-Mannose.\nIf you \ufb01nd that you must take an antibiotic, all is not lost. You\ncan still lessen the severity of yeast overgrowth by avoiding sweets\nand by taking nystatin or Phytostan plus Acidophilus Pearls (again,\nnot within three to six hours of an antibiotic).\n47What if the Yeast Come Back? It is normal for yeast symptoms to\nresolve after treatment. After six weeks on Sporanox or Di\ufb02ucanmany people feel a lot better. However, symptoms may recur soonafter stopping the antifungal. If this happens, I would continuethe Sporanox or Di\ufb02ucan for another six weeks or for as long as isneeded to keep the symptoms at bay. More frequently, people feelbetter after treatment and stay feeling fairly well for a period ofsix to twenty-four months. At that time, we sometimes see arecurrence of symptoms, especially if the person is eating toomuch sugar or is taking antibiotics.\nThe best marker that I have found for recurrent yeast over-\ngrowth is a return of sinusitis or bowel symptoms, with gas, bloat-ing, diarrhea, and/or constipation. If these symptoms persist formore than two weeks, especially if there is even a mild worsen-ing of pain, fatigue, or mental cloudiness, it is reasonable to re-treat yourself with six weeks of acidophilus, nystatin or Phytostan,", "and Sporanox or Di\ufb02ucan. In addition, I would also resume treat-\nment if there is a recurrence of vaginal yeast or other fungal infec-tions. Y ou may repeat this regimen as needed. By using some ofthe natural remedies listed earlier in this chapter, however, youmay be able to avoid repeated use of antifungals and the possiblerisk of becoming resistant to them.\nAntibiotic-Sensitive Infections\nIn traditional medicine, physicians like to look for things that areeasy to test for. If we have no test for an infection, we makebelieve it does not exist. This was the case with polio, Lyme dis-ease, and numerous other infections until tests were developed.Physicians also like to look for infections that can be cultured.These include bacteria such as staph, strep, and E. coli . For these\ninfections, a few bacteria put on a culture dish will grow into mil-lions overnight, and these can then be seen with the naked eye. Isuspect that many kinds of in\ufb02ammatory arthritis (for example,rheumatoid arthritis) and autoimmune diseases are triggered bythe body\u2019s response to infections that we cannot yet culture.\nWhen to Treat with Antibiotics. Having just talked about the prob-\nlems of fungal overgrowth that occur with long-term or frequentantibiotic use, it may seem odd that we will now talk about thebene\ufb01ts of ongoing antibiotic use in some pain patients. This sim-ply helps to remind us that things are neither all good nor all bad.What is important is to use the right tool in the right situation.\nAs mentioned previously, pain may be a signal from your body\nthat there is an underlying infection that is problematic. In othercases, the pain is not caused by the infection but by your body\u2019sreaction as it attempts to \ufb01ght the infection. Unfortunately, themore commonly used antibiotics (penicillin, Ke\ufb02ex, sulfa) may beineffective against slow-growing infections. Research suggeststhat a trial of tetracycline-family antibiotics (and occasionallyantiparasitics) is warranted in the treatment of in\ufb02ammatoryarthritic conditions. I am most likely to consider a trial of six toGENERAL PRINCIPLES OF PAIN RELIEF\n48", "twelve months (or more) of these antibiotics in the following\nsituations:\n\u2022If you have recurrent low-grade fevers (which I de\ufb01ne as\nanything over 98.6\u00b0) and/or chronic lung congestionwithout your doctor \ufb01nding an underlying cause\n\u2022If your pain or other chronic symptoms improved (even\nbrie\ufb02y) while you were taking antibiotics for something else\n\u2022If you have rheumatoid arthritis or other in\ufb02ammatory\narthritis (where your joints are red, hot, and swollen) ofunknown cause\n\u2022If you have persistent sinusitis, skin/scalp pustules, or other\nchronic infections that persist after six weeks of antifungaltherapy\nPeople with these symptoms seem to be more likely to have bac-\nterial, mycoplasma, or chlamydia, or other infections that respondto special antibiotics.\nBowel Parasite Infections\nThe symptoms of parasitic infections can include pain. Asimmune dysfunction may be present in chronic pain patients, Ibelieve that all parasites should be treated.\nI am most likely to test for parasites in patients who have gas,\nbloating, diarrhea, and/or constipation\u2014especially if the symp-toms do not resolve with antifungal therapy, or if the person trav-eled overseas, or developed the bowel symptoms, in the weeks tomonths before the chronic pain began.\nDiagnosing and Treating Bowel Parasites. Most laboratories miss\nparasites when they do stool testing. The only labs that I use forstool testing (by mail) are the Parasitology Center and the GreatSmokies Diagnostic Laboratory (listed in Appendix B). The appro-priate treatment for many bowel parasites depends on which organ-ism is causing the problem. (Further information is available atELIMINATING THE CAUSES AND TRIGGERS OF YOUR PAIN\n49", "vitality101.com.) Prevent parasitic infection by \ufb01ltering your water\nwith an effective \ufb01ltration unit (most are not effective). I recom-mend the Multi-Pure \ufb01lter from Pure Water (see Appendix B).\nOther Infections\nWe will discuss speci\ufb01c infections such as sinusitis, bladder infec-tions, and prostatitis in the chapters on localized pain in Part II.In addition, many things determine how likely your body is toreact with a severe in\ufb02ammatory response and how much damagethis response is likely to do. Nutritional factors such as essentialfatty acids and antioxidants and hormonal factors such as inade-quate cortisol levels can dramatically modify your body\u2019s in\ufb02am-matory response.\nDetoxi\ufb01cation\nAlthough an extensive discussion of detoxi\ufb01cation is beyond thescope of this book, there are several simple things you can do thatcan be very helpful. Sweating can remove toxins, especially if youshower immediately after. Because of this, saunas can be very help-ful for health. With many of the newer far-infrared saunas, a half-hour sauna three to seven times a week may dramatically helpdetoxi\ufb01cation. My wife and I use an excellent one made by HighT ech Health (800-794-5355). Hot baths can also help. The follow-ing detox bath recipe was given to me by a wonderful osteopathicpractitioner, Anette Mnabhi, D.O., who practices in Montgomery,Illinois. Dr. Mnabhi\u2019s patients love it. She has seen one or twoinstances of nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea after the bath. In thesecases, however, the patient felt much better the next day.\nThis detox bath recipe helps with general muscle aches and\npains.\nDetox Bath Recipe\n2 cups Epsom salts\n1 cup baking soda\n1\u20443cup hydrogen peroxideGENERAL PRINCIPLES OF PAIN RELIEF\n50", "Fill the tub with hot water and add the above ingredients. Soak\nfor twenty to thirty minutes. Y ou will sweat in the tub and losetoxins. This causes you to lose some water as well, so it is impor-tant to drink plenty of water while you soak. Some people like toadd fresh lemon juice to their drinking water. If you have a ten-dency to get light-headed easily, be cautious when getting out ofthe tub, or have someone nearby the \ufb01rst time you take a detoxbath. Take a lukewarm to cool shower after getting out of the tubto rinse off the salts or you may itch. Rest for thirty minutes afterthe bath.\nReducing Stress (by Bren Jacobson)\nMost pain is part of a cycle that originates with stress that can bephysical, emotional, psychological, spiritual, or any combinationof these. Any kind of stress causes muscle tension and stiffness,which ultimately leads to permanent muscle tightness and even-tually immobility. This state of chronic contraction of the mus-cles and connective tissue leads to reduced blood \ufb02ow andoxygenation, along with an inability to get rid of toxic wasteproducts. All of these factors put strain on the body, causing it towork harder with less ef\ufb01ciency. This strain on the body causespain that interferes with sound, deep sleep. A lack of sleep lowersone\u2019s stress threshold, and this can become a downward spiral withpain levels increasing exponentially.\nT o reverse this cycle of stress, muscle tightness, pain, loss of\nsleep, and further stress, it is good to interrupt the cycle in asmany places as possible. I have found that prayer, meditation,counseling, lifestyle coaching, exercise, lovemaking, and doingthose activities that one enjoys are all effective ways of reducingstress. As discussed in the previous chapter, poor sleep can becounteracted by herbs, medicine, hot baths, soothing music, alight snack or warm milk. Muscle tightness as well as stressand pain can all be alleviated with bodywork, stretching, andexercise.ELIMINATING THE CAUSES AND TRIGGERS OF YOUR PAIN\n51", "Bodywork\nThe term bodywork generally refers to various types of massage\nand therapies performed on one\u2019s body. I will use it in a muchbroader sense and incorporate anything that affects and improvesthe body including various exercises. Before getting into the var-ious types, here are a few general suggestions that apply to allforms of bodywork.\n\u2022If it\u2019s not working, try something else. If you try any\nform of bodywork and \ufb01nd that you feel worse after a fairtrial, or it causes you continuing discomfort, or you simplydon\u2019t like it, stop and \ufb01nd something you enjoy more andhelps your situation. By a fair trial, I mean that if after oneyoga lesson you feel sore and stiff the next day, don\u2019t give up.Try it regularly, more slowly, for shorter periods of time, andmore gently for a month, and then if you don\u2019t feel that it ishelping, stop and try something else.\n\u2022Always start gradually. Don\u2019t start with three or four\nhours of exercise a day. T wenty minutes of yoga every day isbetter than \ufb01ve hours on the weekend. A daily walk aroundthe block is better than running a marathon once a year. Doonly what feels good and do it only as long as it is enjoyable.\n\u2022Get references. T o \ufb01nd a good therapist or teacher, ask\nfriends for references, check the person\u2019s credentials, and talkto the person to see if you are compatible with them.\n\u2022Check with your doctor. If you have any sort of medical\ncondition, check with your doctor to see if the type ofbodywork you are considering is appropriate and has nopotential to do harm.\n\u2022Always listen to the messages that your body and\nintuition give you. Pay attention to what your body is\ntelling you. Y ou live in your body and have a very intimateknowledge of what is good or bad for it. People often getinto trouble when they ignore what their bodies are tryingto tell them. When one doesn\u2019t listen to one\u2019s body, it oftenGENERAL PRINCIPLES OF PAIN RELIEF\n52", "gives louder, more insistent, and harder to ignore messages\nin the form of pain or disabilities that prevent one fromdoing further damage (like a fuse blowing to prevent a \ufb01rein an electrical system). The Chinese have a saying that isapplicable, \u201cA stumble very often prevents a fall.\u201d\n\u2022Never push yourself, never show off, and never, ever\ncompete with anyone while exercising. If you are in a\nyoga class and the person on the mat next to you is doing aforward bend with her hands \ufb02at on the \ufb02oor and her headtouching her knees, and you can barely touch your toes, itdoesn\u2019t matter at all. The purpose of the exercise is not totouch the \ufb02oor or your toes but to stretch the muscles ofyour back. Forcing yourself can cause severe injury.\n\u2022Forget the adage \u201cno pain, no gain.\u201d It has no truth \nand often causes painful injuries. \u201cSlow, gradual, andcomfortable\u201d is a much better and safer approach.\n\u2022Always warm up before exercise or athletics with\nslow, gentle movements and stretches. This is one of\nthe best ways to avoid injury. It is equally important to cooldown after exercise. Some form of complete relaxation is agood way to end your workout.\n\u2022Natural activity is good. Any natural activity that uses\nyour entire body, does not involve extreme exertion, doesnot involve high impact, and which is fun is probably goodfor you. Some examples of this are walking (one of the best,easiest, cheapest, and most readily available activities foralmost everyone), swimming, dancing, making love,gardening, and bicycling. It is a good practice to alternatethese activities so as to achieve a good balance in your body.Some of the activities that I have found to cause pain andinjury are lifting heavy weights, running, and ballet.Running often causes lower back pain, disc compression,and damage (the impact on the spine when running is threetimes the body weight). It also causes stress fractures, tornligaments, and knee damage (knees incur \ufb01ve times theELIMINATING THE CAUSES AND TRIGGERS OF YOUR PAIN\n53", "amount of force when running as they do when walking). I\nhave worked with numerous ballet dancers and weight liftersand have seen many who are totally disabled and many whoare in constant, unbearable, and intractable pain.\nMovement, Exercise, and Bodywork. In this section I will give a\nbasic overview of a few types of bodywork that can be effectivein relieving pain, and I will recommend some books as I go.Movement and exercise include such disciplines as yoga, tai chichuan, chi gong, Pilates, and others.\nThe most complete and time-tested system of exercise is yoga.\nIt combines balance, stretching, resistance, breathing, and focus.T oday, yoga has gone from being an esoteric spiritual practice tobeing commonplace. There are many different types of yoga, andmost of them have bene\ufb01t. A good type of yoga for anyone start-ing out is a gentle form of hatha yoga. Sivananda yoga, a popularand comprehensive form of hatha yoga, is described in SwamiVishnu Devananda\u2019s Complete Illustrated Book of Yoga and in The\nSivananda Companion to Yoga . The Sivananda organization has\ncenters throughout the world that give classes, train teachers, andoffer yoga vacations and retreats. More information can be foundonline at sivananda.org. The advanced student can go on to tryBikram yoga, Iyengar yoga (explained in the book Light on Yoga ),\nastanga yoga, Kundalini yoga, and Anusara yoga.\nIdeally, the student will not just use yoga as a series of exer-\ncises, but will also become acquainted with the yoga diet, philos-ophy, lifestyle, breathing exercises, and meditation. All of thesecomprise a system that is extremely effective in relieving, as wellas preventing, pain. It is possible to begin practicing yoga from abook, but it is much better to start by taking a class from a certi-\ufb01ed teacher. It is important to begin gently, to never compete, tonever force a posture to the point of pain, and to do all of theexercises mindfully. Done properly, yoga will be enjoyable.\nIn yoga as well as all forms of exercise, correct breathing is of\nthe utmost importance. Breath is a link between the mind andGENERAL PRINCIPLES OF PAIN RELIEF\n54", "body. When the body is in pain or the mind is frightened, breath-\ning is short, rapid, and irregular. If a person is relaxed and in a stateof enjoyment, breathing is long, slow, deep, and regular. It is pos-sible to change one\u2019s state of being by simply focusing on andchanging one\u2019s breathing. Practitioners of zazen, one of the mosteffective forms of meditation, as well as vipassana meditation usethis concentration on their breath as a major part of their practice.A powerful way of dealing with pain is to visualize the breath asa colored healing stream of energy and to concentrate on direct-ing the breath to the part of the body where the pain is. Imaginethe healing energy of the breath dissolving the pain and carryingit out of the body with each exhalation.\nAnother breathing practice that can be useful and which is an\nessential part of a c omplete yoga practice is called pranayama. This\nconsists of a series of powerful breathing exercises that arouse andcontrol the \ufb02ow of energy in the body. In any exercise, it isimportant when bending forward to exhale and to inhale whenbending backward. It is also good to coordinate the breath withthe motion so that when you begin to bend forward, you beginto exhale, ending the exhalation when you reach the limit of yourforward bend.\nAnother wonderful system of bodywork is tai chi chuan. It is,\nall at the same time, an exercise, a dance, a moving meditation, asystem of energy generation and regulation, breath control, and amartial art. It was developed over thousands of years by Chinesemonks and is practiced throughout China by millions of people.It consists of a series of many \u201chands\u201d or postures and movementslinked together in a very slow, harmonious, and graceful dance.T oday there are numerous books and videos that teach variousforms of tai chi, but it is very dif\ufb01cult to learn it that way. Myadvice is to join a class that proceeds slowly and rigorously. Forhealth and pain relief purposes, it is better to avoid schools thatteach tai chi as a martial art.\nSimilar to tai chi is another Chinese practice called chi gong.\nThis is a type of healing that can be performed by a practitionerELIMINATING THE CAUSES AND TRIGGERS OF YOUR PAIN\n55", "and is also a system of exercise, with more emphasis on healing\nand controlling the \ufb02ow of energy in the body. An excellentintroduction to the philosophy, history, and practice of chi gongcan be found in books by Ken Cohen.\nPilates is a system of bodywork that is enjoying increasing\npopularity in the United States. It c omplements the other systems\nof bodywork that I have mentioned and is taught in many gymsand spas. Pilates is somewhat vigorous and should be done bysomeone who is already fairly healthy. As with other forms ofbodywork, it is of the utmost importance to work with a prop-erly trained and experienced teacher.\nThere are various other forms of bodywork that focus on\nproper and ef\ufb01cient ways to move and use one\u2019s body. Theseinclude Feldenkrais work, Alexander technique, Rolf movementwork, Trager Mentastics, and Aston patterning. Some types ofbodywork performed by a practitioner focus primarily on thephysical body and others concentrate on the body\u2019s energy sys-tem. In all cases, however, there is an overlap. For example, acu-puncture is primarily a way of enhancing the proper \ufb02ow ofenergy in the body, but it also effects physical change. Likewise,structural integration/Rol\ufb01ng, which works only on the physicalbody, always affects the energy system.\nFurthermore, anything that changes the body physically not\nonly changes a person\u2019s structure and physiology, but also changesthe person emotionally and psychologically. We are all familiarwith the term psychosomatic , meaning bodily symptoms caused by\nmental or emotional disturbance. The reverse phenomenon ofphysical improvement causing a corresponding psychologicalimprovement, or somatopsychic , is not as universally recognized. An\nanalogy I use to illustrate this phenomenon is that the body and themind are like the back and the palm of the hand. Both are sepa-rate, distinct, different, and distinguishable, but it is impossible tomove or in any way change one without a corresponding changein the other. They are inextricably linked. Just think about the lasttime you hit your \ufb01nger with a hammer or stubbed your toe.GENERAL PRINCIPLES OF PAIN RELIEF\n56", "Massage Therapies That Involve Bodywork. Before discussing var-\nious types of bodywork and massage, I would like to give a fewcautionary notes. Anyone with open sores, an infectious disease,severe psychological imbalance, a fracture or other serious injury,an acute illness, or a pain or other symptom that is increasing infrequency or severity should see a physician before trying any ofthe following therapies. If you have acute appendicitis or hepati-tis, for example, an acupuncturist, chiropractor, or re\ufb02exologistwould not be the appropriate therapist to go to.\nOver a period of thirty-\ufb01ve years I have studied and practiced\nmany forms of bodywork worldwide, and I now work with myown fusion of all of them. If, however, I were to be asked whichsingle form of bodywork I \ufb01nd most profoundly effective inrelieving pain as well as enhancing well-being and vitality, Iwould recommend structural integration. This is a holistic systemof balancing and integrating the body that was developed by Dr.Ida P . Rolf and which has been called Rol\ufb01ng by many of itspractitioners to honor her.\nI had the great honor of studying advanced Rol\ufb01ng with Dr.\nRolf and have practiced it for more than thirty years. I \ufb01nd it tobe the most holistic, long lasting, and transformative form ofbodywork available. An excellent source of information aboutstructural integration is available online at rolfguild.org. Excellentbooks on the subject are available. T wo of the best are Rol\ufb01ng:\nReestablishing the Natural Alignment and Structural Integration of theHuman Body for Vitality and Well-Being and Rol\ufb01ng and Physical\nReality , both by Dr. Ida P . Rolf.\nStructural integration involves ten sessions of work with most\nof the work being done with connective tissue to straighten andbalance the body so that it gets support from gravity, rather thanbeing torn down by it. The results that most people get arereduced pain, more energy, better posture, and less anxiety, as wellas easier, more ef\ufb01cient, and more graceful movement. A fairlycommon remark by people who have had this work done is thatthey feel more attractive, have more energy, and feel healthier.ELIMINATING THE CAUSES AND TRIGGERS OF YOUR PAIN\n57", "Because so much pain and dysfunction is caused by imbalance and\nstructural problems, such as one leg being shorter than the other,uneven hip heights, the head being forward, the pelvis tilted, orthe shoulders rotated, this is an extremely effective approach foralleviating these problems and the pain caused by them.\nMassage is a broad category of bodywork that involves hands-\non manipulation. It is one of the oldest forms of healing and hasbeen used from time immemorial. T oday there are scores of dif-ferent schools of massage. One of the best introductions to thevarious types is the book Hands on Healing by Jack Angelo.\nOne wide group of massage techniques uses stroking, friction,\nkneading, and vibration. This relaxes muscles and increases bloodand lymph \ufb02ow, while increasing oxygenation of the tissues of thebody. This type of work generally relieves muscular tension andleaves the person feeling relaxed and energized at the same time.This category includes Swedish massage, sports massage, Esalenmassage, tuina (a type of Chinese massage), and lymphaticdrainage massage.\nAdditional Bodywork Therapies. Other forms of bodywork focus\non regulating and directing the \ufb02ow of energy in the body. Theseinclude acupuncture, re\ufb02exology, shiatsu, polarity work, do-in,and applied kinesiology. Thai massage is explained well in thebook Thai Massage: Sacred Bodywork by Ananda Apfelbaum.\nVarious types of bodywork mobilize joints and release muscles,\nwhile straightening and balancing the spine. These include chiro-practic work, osteopathy, Trager, and cranial-sacral work. The\ufb01rst two are very complementary to the therapies mentionedabove. A Canadian study recommended chiropractic treatment asan effective \ufb01rst-line treatment for acute back pain. The latter twoare both very gentle and powerful.\nHow to Use Bodywork for Optimum Effect. Any and all of these\nsystems and techniques will help to relieve pain but obviously noGENERAL PRINCIPLES OF PAIN RELIEF\n58", "person has the time, money, or energy to do them all. Nor are all\ntypes of work suited to all people. It is best to talk to other peo-ple and health practitioners as well as read more about these heal-ing modalities and then try one. If it helps, keep doing it, and ifnot, try another. Never get discouraged. Each type of bodyworkwill help in some way and each will teach you something aboutyourself.\nI would like to note that many of the things I have mentioned\nare synergistic. This means that they work together and enhanceeach other so that the total effect is greater than each done sepa-rately. In other words the total effect is greater than the sum ofthe parts. A combination that I have found to be particularlyeffective is yoga, structural integration, meditation, and tai chi.\nThe Bene\ufb01ts of Meditation for Stress Reduction\nMany associate meditation with someone who shaves his or herhead and bangs a tambourine in an airport or someone who sits ina cave contemplating his navel. The truth is that every religiousand spiritual tradition worldwide advocates some form of medi-tation. There are also many individuals with no religious or spir-itual aspirations who meditate for reasons that are as varied aslowering their blood pressure to improving their golf game. Manyrecent studies have shown the bene\ufb01ts of meditation to be as far-ranging as increasing life expectancy, stress and pain control, bet-ter immune function, lower blood pressure, increased fertility, lessPMS, and fewer headaches.\nWhat I mean by meditation is one-pointed, focused mindful-\nness and awareness. This can be visual concentration on a candle\ufb02ame or religious icon or an auditory input, such as wholeheart-edly listening to a Gregorian chant or the waves on a beach. Theverbal or silent repetition of a mantra is another form of medita-tion. Some people \ufb01nd the repetition of a word like \u201cpeace\u201d help-ful. This is talked about in Dr. Herb Benson\u2019s book The Relaxation\nResponse . Others recite the rosary or a syllable such as \u201cOm,\u201d orELIMINATING THE CAUSES AND TRIGGERS OF YOUR PAIN\n59", "they repeat their name over and over as did Alfred Lord T ennyson.\nMindful meditation can involve a kinesthetic experience such aswalking or doing an everyday task such as gardening or washingdishes with full attention and awareness. The secret is to \u201cdo onething.\u201d In other words, when you are washing dishes, focus onlyon doing the dishes. Be aware of the sound of the water, the feelof the dishes, the way your muscles work to accomplish the task,the smell of the soap, and the appearance of the soap bubbles. Ifyour back becomes tired, be aware of that in an observant ratherthan a judgmental way. When you are doing the dishes think, \u201cIam doing the dishes.\u201d Try not to let the usual useless mind chat-ter take over, such as, \u201cBoy, I wish I didn\u2019t have to do the dishes;I wonder what\u2019s on television; I wish I had said such and such toso and so earlier today; wouldn\u2019t it be great if I had a dishwasher;maybe I should use paper plates.\u201d If these thoughts intrude, justlet them go without judging yourself for losing focus and get backto \u201cwashing the dishes.\u201d\nObserving, concentrating, and becoming one with one\u2019s\nbreathing are all part of another form of meditation. One of thebest practical manuals for this form of meditation, called zazen, isPhilip Kapleau\u2019s The Three Pillars of Zen . Another very good\nintroduction to meditation is Mindfulness Meditation: Cultivating\nthe Wisdom of Your Body and Mind by Jon Kabat Zinn.\nThe Bene\ufb01ts of Sex for Stress Reduction\nLast but not least, I have alluded to the bene\ufb01ts of sex. I would\nlike to expand on what I mean by this. T o begin with, I am talk-ing about more than a simple orgasmic release. I am speakingabout all forms of physical give-and-take in a loving relationship.This can range from wild sex to a simple foot massage. There havebeen an increasing number of studies from such conservative bas-tions as Johns Hopkins and Dartmouth as to the physical and emo-tional health bene\ufb01ts of this kind of relationship and its ability tomaintain well-being and reduce pain. Part of this has to do withGENERAL PRINCIPLES OF PAIN RELIEF\n60", "the release of neurotransmitters such as endorphins and oxytocin,\nbut the cardiovascular bene\ufb01ts, not to mention the pleasurederived, cause a cascade of health-promoting effects from bettersleep to improved immune function. There is even proof that fre-quent sex increases growth hormone levels, resulting in less pain,weight loss, a more youthful appearance, and even an increase inlife expectancy!\nConsidering Ergonomics (by Bren Jacobson)\nErgonomics refers to the science of engineering, adapting, anddesigning machines, tools, and furniture to suit people andincrease ef\ufb01ciency. I will use the term here in its broader sense toinclude the ways in which individuals adapt themselves to theirenvironment and work.\nEven very subtle imbalances in our bodies or in the way we\nuse them can cause severe pain. Dr. Rolf taught that the con-nective tissue in the body forms a continuous web so that anyinjury, strain, or in\ufb02ammation is instantly and lastingly commu-nicated to the entire body. She often used the analogy of tryingto straighten out a wrinkled bedsheet; as soon as one tugs on onecorner of the sheet to get rid of a crease, it causes another creasesomewhere else.\nA more practical example of this principle is illustrated in what\nhappens to a woman\u2019s body when she wears high-heeled shoes.The most energy ef\ufb01cient and comfortable way to stand is verti-cally. When high-heeled shoes are worn, the woman\u2019s weight isshifted forward to a fairly small area on the ball of the foot. T omake matters worse, the toes are jammed into the front of theshoe, causing bunions that are both painful and unattractive. Inaddition, there is excess tension in the ankle, which causes immo-bility in the joint. Because of the elevation of the heel, the calfmuscle and Achilles tendon shorten, causing increased stress onthe knee. With the weight and therefore the pelvis being shiftedELIMINATING THE CAUSES AND TRIGGERS OF YOUR PAIN\n61", "forward, the shoulders come back and the head goes forward to\ncompensate. The pelvis also tilts forward creating a lordosis (sway-back) and causing the abdomen to protrude, making the personlook many pounds heavier than she actually is. The long-termeffects of simply elevating the heels a few inches are almost invari-ably lower back, upper back, and neck pain, as these are the partsof the body that have to constantly do extra work to compensatefor the imbalance created by the shoes. A whole constellation ofsecondary pains and other symptoms can arise from this appar-ently simple cause, including headaches, knee pain, imbalance,pain in the jaw, poor digestion, and fatigue.\nThe feet are the only interface that we have with the earth.\nThey are, in other words, our sole foundation and support for theentire body. If we do not have proper weight distribution, \ufb02exi-bility, contact, and support from our feet, our entire body will suf-fer. We will become \u201cungrounded.\u201d\nAs an interesting example of synchronicity, just after \ufb01nishing\nthe paragraphs above I stopped writing to read the New York\nTimes \u2019s science section and came across the article \u201cIn the Relent-\nless Pursuit of Fashion, the Feet Pay the Price.\u201d The article quotedthe president of the Podiatric Medical Association as saying, \u201cthecurrent trend in fashion is very bad for women\u2019s feet.\u201d He andother medical experts said that poorly designed and \ufb01tting shoesthat included not only high heels, but \ufb02ip-\ufb02ops, some runningshoes, and platform shoes, cause the problems that I have alreadymentioned as well as causing nerve damage. These shoes make thewearer more prone to accidents and ankle sprains. They upset thestabilizing mechanics of the foot, contributing to arthritis, inhibit-ing range of motion, causing loss of toe strength, shin splints, andfoot deformities such as bunions and hammer toes as well as plan-tar fascial tears and fasciitis (pain along the soles of the feet).\nAnother example of an ergonomic problem is that of a man\nwho came to see me in Holland. For over twelve years he had suf-fered from extreme and constant pains in his neck, in his shoul-GENERAL PRINCIPLES OF PAIN RELIEF\n62", "ders, and between his shoulder blades, as well as unbearable\nmigraine headaches. He had gone to over forty healers, includingneurologists, surgeons, shamans, and hypnotists. No one hadhelped him. As I took his history, I asked what kind of work hedid. He replied that he played cello for the Amsterdam Concerte-bau Orchestra and he practiced four to six hours a day. I thenasked him to pretend that he was playing his cello so that I couldsee how he was using his body. When he did this, I observed thathe bent forward at the waist, hunched his shoulders, and broughthis head forward. All of this was obviously the cause of his prob-lems, and I asked him why he didn\u2019t sit erect. He replied that thecello was low and he was tall, and hence he had always playedhunched over. I suggested that he was intelligent enough to \ufb01g-ure out a way to raise the cello. As it turned out there is a pegunder the cello that adjusts its height. He went home and adjustedthe height of his cello. He called me a week later and said that bysimply sitting erect while playing, his pain had gone from beingtortuous to only a mild annoyance, his headaches had disappeared,and his teacher had remarked that his playing was much improved(because he was no longer \u201cwrapped\u201d around the instrument andhad more freedom in his arms and shoulders).\nI could go on with endless examples of people that I have\ncounseled who have suffered years of torment because of a poorlyplaced computer monitor, a piece of furniture that didn\u2019t suitthem, an activity they performed in the wrong way, or trying todo a job with an inappropriate or poorly designed tool. I suggestthe following guidelines to help you avoid these problems.\nKeep a Daily Ergonomics Journal\nRate whatever pain or discomfort you have on a scale of 1 to 10,with 1 being no pain and 10 being excruciating pain. This can bedone at any time of the day, but the end of the day is a good timeand it is preferable to do it at the same time each day if possible. Onany day that your pain level is low (1 to 3) or high (7 to 10) try toELIMINATING THE CAUSES AND TRIGGERS OF YOUR PAIN\n63", "examine and record any variables that might make that day differ-\nent from others. Some things you might consider are the following:\n\u2022Is it a workday or a holiday?

It is particularly important, if you have pain, to noticeif you are better or worse when sleeping away from homeon a different bed.\n\u2022What types of stress have you been subjected to that day?\nAre any of them new or different?

I have counseled thousands of people and can tell\nhundreds of stories like the one above about the Dutch cellist whorelieved years of pain by playing detective and \ufb01nding the factorsthat caused his pain. It is particularly important to keep a writtenjournal on a daily basis, because on the days that the pain is severeit can be so distracting that you wouldn\u2019t think of trying to trackdown the cause of your pain. On days when you feel good, it iscommon to forget that you ever had pain and you don\u2019t want toexpend the energy to think about it.\nVary Your Work and Play\nOne of my teachers said that \u201cthe best vacation is a change ofwork.\u201d There is much truth in the saying. Instead of spending awhole day cleaning the house and another day gardening and yetanother day doing paperwork, it is far preferable to spend a shortertime doing each and then switching. This enables you to not onlyuse different muscle groups, but different mind functions. It alsocreates a relaxing change of pace and prevents ennui.\nEven if you are doing everything right, one risk that comes of\nnot varying activities is the possibility of straining muscles andtendons through the excessive repetition of a movement\u2014knownas repetitive use syndrome. If you are doing anything that is repet-itive, try to switch, at least temporarily, to a different activity atthe \ufb01rst indication of any physical strain or discomfort.\nEqually important is to intersperse work periods with time\nspent in play, relaxation, exercise, entertainment, and meditationor reverie. One of the most invigorating and healing practices is atwenty-minute afternoon siesta or nap. Not everyone has the lux-ury to indulge in this, but even having lunch in a park or quietplace instead of a busy restaurant can be bene\ufb01cial.\nBecome Aware of What Your Body Is Telling You\nAt the risk of sounding repetitive, I will say that one of the mostimportant things you can do is to listen to your body. Our bod-ies communicate with us through aches, pains, pleasures, resist-ELIMINATING THE CAUSES AND TRIGGERS OF YOUR PAIN\n65", "ances to certain activities, or reactions to different conditions. The\nbody has its own wisdom and very often, even though it doesn\u2019thave warning lights like your car, it will through various meansattempt to communicate with you. T o expand on this car analogy,if you race your engine constantly or subject it to long periods ofdisuse, use the wrong fuel, or neglect preventative maintenance,you will eventually have a breakdown. If this seems a silly anal-ogy, consider that many of the people that I work with routinelychecked their car\u2019s tire pressure but have never had their bloodpressure checked. Others wouldn\u2019t think of using low-test gaso-line but regularly eat junk food. Still others never go more thansix months without having their automobile serviced but haven\u2019thad a physical checkup in years.\nI have learned over the years that when the body gives a sub-\ntle hint or message that is ignored by its owner, it will continueto give the same message in a different way or at increased vol-ume. If it is still ignored it will continuously try to make its mes-sage clear. If the person still does not pay attention, it will try tomake it impossible for the person to persist in the activity that maybe endangering him or her. One example is the person who isoverexerting himself on a constant basis. The body\u2019s \ufb01rst messagemight be lethargy, discomfort, or mild digestive upset. When thatperson ignores these conditions and continues to work too long,too hard, or too constantly, the pain, tiredness, and indigestionwill most certainly grow worse. If these indications are ignored,the body in its wisdom realizes that the path that the person ispersisting on may lead to severe repercussions such as a nervousbreakdown, loss of job or relationship, or even a life-threateningoccurrence such as a heart attack. At that point the body puts intoplay some form of circuit breaker that forces the person to stopwhat he is doing. This can take the form of headaches, back pain,chronic fatigue, \ufb01bromyalgia, or irritable bowel syndrome. It ismuch better to heed the early warning signals we get from ourbodies and moderate our behavior than it is to deal with thesemore serious conditions.GENERAL PRINCIPLES OF PAIN RELIEF\n66", "Y ou are your body and, if you pay close attention to it, you\nwill often become aware of problems long before a diagnostic test,x-ray, or doctor\u2019s exam will. This doesn\u2019t mean that you shouldnot talk to your doctor about your concerns. As many spiritualtraditions have held, the body is the temple of the soul. It shouldnever be disregarded, and anyone who does, does so at his or herown risk.\nUse Your Body and Enjoy It\nThe same goes for your mind and spirit. Don\u2019t become a couchpotato. One of the best ways to stay healthy and young is to con-stantly try new activities, meet new people, explore new places,try new foods, keep in touch with old friends and family, read newbooks, and be of service to those who are less fortunate or capa-ble than you. Use it or lose it. I would not be so presumptuous asto believe that I know what the true meaning of life is or what theideal way to live is, but I am absolutely sure that it is not aboutdoing as little as possible while accumulating as much as possible.I am sure that service, knowledge, home, family, friends, com-munity, and relationships in general are much more importantthan most other things that people strive for. They are also morehealing and bring more happiness. Many spend their lives strivingfor wealth, thinking that money will bring happiness. Truewealth, however, is not getting what you want but wanting whatyou have.\nAfter thirty-\ufb01ve years as a healer I can say with great convic-\ntion that the four best medicines for pain are laughter, sleep, tears,and loving, although not necessarily in that order. They also arenecessary to create true health, wholeness, and happiness.\nFind a Better Way to Do Things That Cause You Pain\nIf doing any activity causes pain, and you must do it, \ufb01nd a bet-ter way to do it. T oday there are many devices that make variousactivities, from opening a bottle to digging in the garden, easier.These devices can be found in various catalogs or on the Internet.ELIMINATING THE CAUSES AND TRIGGERS OF YOUR PAIN\n67", "One good example of this is the Jar Key. It is a simple device that\nbreaks the vacuum seal on food jars. This enables one to removethe lid with minimal effort and no torquing force on the wrist.Sometimes a little bit of ingenuity goes a long way. Very often byusing a lever, wedge, or pulley, you can reduce the effort neces-sary to do a job to a fraction of what it might have been.\nAlso, when lifting, keep your back straight and your feet apart\nto give yourself a broad, stable foundation. When lifting things,turn your entire body, using your legs rather than twisting yourspine. If you can push or pull or slide an object instead of lifting,do that. If you can put something under the object to be movedto reduce friction, do so.\nFind the Most Comfortable Furniture for You\nRemember the adage that \u201cone man\u2019s meat is another\u2019s poison.\u201dThere is not any one shoe, mattress, diet, therapy, exercise pro-gram, climate, career, or lifestyle that is perfect or right for every-one, despite advertising claims to the contrary. I remember a manI Rolfed in Spain. He suffered severe burning and pain on gettingup in the morning. I suspected a bad mattress and suggested tohim that this might be the source of his problem. He was positivethe mattress could not possibly be the problem because it had costsix thousand dollars, had been designed by Germany\u2019s mostfamous orthopedic surgeon, and had been prescribed by Spain\u2019stop back specialist. He even brought me to his home to examineit and try it out. I laid down on it and it was a very comfortable,supportive, \ufb01rm mattress, and I had to agree with him that it wasprobably not the cause of his pain. I Rolfed him, which was ben-e\ufb01cial for his general well-being and his back, but he still had theburning sensation when he woke up. He later tried chiropractic,acupuncture, Mezier work, and physical therapy with the sameresults. I ran into him a year and a half later and he told me thatthe burning sensation had disappeared. I immediately thought thatthe Rol\ufb01ng, which usually takes a full year after the work is \ufb01n-ished to manifest its full bene\ufb01t, had \ufb01nally done the trick. He toldGENERAL PRINCIPLES OF PAIN RELIEF\n68", "me that what had really made the most difference was going to a\nhotel that had cheap, soft, sagging mattresses, which evidentlysuited him better then the super expensive one that he hadimported from Germany.\nAlways buy for comfort, adjustability, and functionality rather\nthan cost, an expert\u2019s opinion, a brand name, appearance, or fash-ion. Much of the furniture that is available today is overstuffedand too soft to give proper support, or it is of an extreme shapethat would look good in an art museum but is not suited to thehuman body. Very often the best chair is a simple old-fashioned,straight-backed chair. Instead of buying the fanciest sports car,buy one that you can drive without getting back pain. A simplerule of thumb is to \u201ctry before you buy\u201d (or be sure that you cantake it back if it turns out to be unsuitable). If you are buying acar, try renting that model \ufb01rst and drive \ufb01ve hundred miles, andsee how your back feels at the end of the trip. When buying achair that you might spend 20 percent of the rest of your life in,go to the store and sit in every chair until you \ufb01nd the one thatis most comfortable. Sit in that one for an hour or so and read amagazine and see how you feel at the end of that period. Shoes,which I have already spoken of at length, can cause more prob-lems than any other item people use. They should always be cho-sen for comfort before any other consideration. The thing youare using should not only be appropriate for you but also theactivity it is being used for. For instance, running shoes are notappropriate for hiking.\nAnother good general rule is to buy the item that is the most\nadjustable and customizable. If you buy a computer desk, forinstance, buy one on which the height of the monitor and thekeyboard can be adjusted independently. When shopping for anof\ufb01ce chair, look for one that can be adjusted for the height of theseat, the height of the arms, the height and amount of lumbar sup-port, and the amount of tilt as well as the force needed to changethe tilt. Likewise, the more separate adjustments an automobileseat has, the easier it is to make it comfortable for your body. TheELIMINATING THE CAUSES AND TRIGGERS OF YOUR PAIN\n69", "more customizable anything is, the easier it is to get it to work\nef\ufb01ciently with your body.\nBilaterally Balance Physical Activities\nFor example, if you are carrying something like a shopping bag,switch hands frequently (the tendency is always to use your dom-inant or strong side, which increases imbalance), divide the loadinto two bags, use a backpack, or, ideally, use a wheeled cart.\nOne of the most common problems I see is neck and back pain\ncaused by of\ufb01ce workers holding their telephone receiver withtheir shoulder while using a keyboard. This is very easily dealtwith by getting a headset from a store like Radio Shack, Best Buy,or Circuit City. Almost all cordless and cellular phones have jacksfor a headset, and Radio Shack has regular phones with headsets.Another solution is using a speaker phone, and GE makes onewith good sound quality that I bought for twelve dollars.\nLose the Extra Weight\nFinally, one stress factor that is frequently overlooked is that ofexcessive weight, which can sap one\u2019s energy and cause harmfulwear and tear in the joints. Every extra pound of weight a personcarries causes four pounds of pressure in the knee. This in itselfcan cause extreme pain.\nGetting Help\nAs we\u2019ve seen in the last two sections, it is important to addressboth stress and structural issues. I have found Bren Jacobson to bean extraordinarily gifted counselor who can help with both psy-chological counseling and guiding people through the myriadhealth-care options that are available (see Appendix B).\nDealing with Trauma\nTrauma can also cause pain by many mechanisms, so I want tobrie\ufb02y touch on it here. Initially it can cause in\ufb02ammation ordirect tissue injury. If bleeding occurs into the area, the iron inGENERAL PRINCIPLES OF PAIN RELIEF\n70", "the blood can actually continually trigger in\ufb02ammation (iron is\n\u201cpro oxidative\u201d). This ongoing in\ufb02ammation can be shut down\nby using antioxidants. Nutritional and sleep remedies also supportthe healing of injuries. Often, an injured muscle can get stuck ina shortened position, causing years or decades of pain.\nUsing some simple physical therapy techniques such as stretch\nand spray (where a special, cold spray administered by a therapistto the painful area temporarily blocks the pain), the shortenedmuscles can often be released in a matter of seconds or minutes\u2014often with instantaneous relief of what had been chronic pain.Sometimes this is all that is needed for permanent pain relief.Other times, the muscle again contracts to the shortened position,causing pain. This problem (of recurrent pain) often respondsbeautifully to nutritional, sleep, and hormonal support, and toeliminating underlying infections as discussed earlier. It is alsoimportant, of course, to treat any structural abnormalities.\nIce and heat can both be helpful for a trauma injury. Ice works\nbest for the \ufb01rst twenty-four to thirty-six hours after acuteinjuries or for problems where in\ufb02ammation plays a role becauseof its anti-in\ufb02ammatory effect. Heat works best for chronic painor for injuries that are over twenty-four hours old because itincreases blood \ufb02ow (and therefore healing) in the area. Only usethe ice or heat for twenty minutes at a time so you don\u2019t freeze oroverheat the affected area and cause further injury. Ice and heatcan also be alternated for injuries over twenty-four hours old orfor chronic pain. Use the ice \ufb01rst for twenty minutes (this acts asan anti-in\ufb02ammatory) followed by a heating pad or moist heat fortwenty minutes. Y ou can use either of these as often as you like,as long as you wait at least thirty minutes after the treatmentbefore repeating the cycle.\nIn these last few chapters, you have read about a number of gen-\neral principles that apply to pain relief and pain management. InPart II, you will \ufb01nd speci\ufb01c details of when and how to applythese principles to speci\ufb01c types of pain.ELIMINATING THE CAUSES AND TRIGGERS OF YOUR PAIN\n71", "This page intentionally left blank ", "PART II\nEvaluating and Treating\nCommon T ypes of Pain\nNew research suggests that pain affects men and women differently.\nThis likely occurs in part because of hormonal differences related toestrogen and testosterone. For example, male animals injected withestrogen appear to have a lower pain threshold, while giving testos-terone to female animals increases pain tolerance. How pain is trans-mitted in our bodies also contributes to the differences in how painis felt by men and women. Both sexes have a natural ability to sup-press pain, but the mechanisms are different.\nSocietal factors may also play a role. Women are quicker to seek\nmedical help and less likely to allow pain to control their lives. Theyare also more likely to ask for help from their friends. A person\u2019s agealso plays a role in pain. One out of \ufb01ve older Americans takes apainkiller on a regular basis. Because they are prone to medications\u2019side effects, such as bleeding ulcers from nonsteroidal anti-in\ufb02ammatory drugs (NSAIDs), \ufb01nding alternative and safer remediesis especially helpful for older patients.\nIn these next few chapters, I will explain the basic types of pain\n(nerve, muscle/myofascial, arthritis, in\ufb02ammatory, and so on) and thetreatments that are most effective for eliminating them.\n73\nCopyright \u00a9 200 6 by Jacob  Teitelbaum .

As I mentioned in Chapter 1, pain serves a\ncritical function, and we would be in serious trouble if wecouldn\u2019t feel what is happening in our bodies. However, pain thatdoesn\u2019t quit is worrisome. Chronic pain can result from diseases,infections, or trauma. However, there is a different type of painthat affects the nerves and can be unbearable. The term neuropathic\npain, or nerve pain, refers to a wide range of problems that cause\ndiseases of, or injury to, the nervous system. It is a category ofpain syndromes and not a single problem. Neuropathic pain cancome from malfunction of nerves or the brain associated with ill-ness (diabetes, low thyroid), infections (shingles), pinched nerves,nutritional de\ufb01ciencies (vitamins B \u2086and B \u2081\u2082), injury (stroke,\ntumors, spinal cord injury, and multiple sclerosis), and medica-tion/treatment side effects (radiation and chemotherapy, AIDSdrugs, Flagyl). It is estimated that 50 to 80 percent of diabeticswill develop some nerve injury, with 30 to 40 percent of thesehaving painful diabetic neuropathy unless preventive measures aretaken such as nutritional support. Neuropathic pain affectsapproximately 0.6 to 1.5 percent of the U.S. population (roughlytwo million Americans) and 25 to 40 percent of cancer patients.CHAPTER4\n75\nCopyright \u00a9 200 6 by Jacob  Teitelbaum . Click here for terms of use.  ", "Types and Causes of Neuropathic (Nerve) Pain\nNeuropathies are characterized by pain that is burning, shooting\n(often to distant areas), or stabbing. It also has an \u201celectric\u201d qual-ity about it. Tingling or numbness ( paresthesias ) and increased sen-\nsitivity with normal touch being painful ( allodynia ) are also\ncommonly seen. Continual pain is often present regardless ofwhat the patient does or does not do. In some cases, pain comesin sudden attacks without any apparent trigger. Diagnosis is madepredominantly by history and physical examination, as testingoften offers little bene\ufb01t clinically unless the testing is looking fora treatable cause.\nAs with other pain problems, neuropathies are both expensive\nand poorly treated. In one study of 55,686 patients with neuro-pathic pain, health-care charges were threefold higher than theywere in the overall population ($17,355 versus $5,715 per year,respectively). Use of relatively ineffective therapies such asNSAIDs (like Motrin) and opioids was widespread, while rela-tively few received anti-epileptic drugs, tricyclic antidepressants,or any of the many other medications that are often much moreeffective in relieving neuropathic pain.\nIn the presence of nerve pain, it is especially important to look\nfor treatable causes. Lab testing should include:\n\u2022A blood count (CBC) and an in\ufb02ammation/sedimentation\nrate (ESR)\n\u2022Thyroid testing with a free T4 and TSH\n\u2022Vitamin B\n12level\n\u2022Screening for diabetes with a morning fasting blood sugar\nand a glycosylated hemoglobin (HgBA1C)\nThe medical history should be assessed for excess alcohol use,\nvitamin de\ufb01ciencies, hereditary factors, or treatment with med-ications that can cause nerve injury. A neurological examinationmay also give an indication of the cause.EVALUATING AND TREATING COMMON TYPES OF PAIN\n76", "Nerve pain is often associated with a process known as pain-\nsensitization. The nerves and brain are like wires that carry infor-mation. When they become overstimulated with chronic pain, itmay make the whole system overexcitable. In these situations nor-mal touch and other usually comfortable contact can be painful.Medications that stimulate the calming (GABA) receptors in thebrain, such as a number of antiseizure medications, can help set-tle the system and decrease pain.\nPostherpetic Neuralgia (PHN)\nPostherpetic neuralgia follows a rash called herpes zoster . Often\ncalled shingles, it is caused by the same virus that causes chickenpox. The \ufb01rst time you get chicken pox, the virus remains in yournerve endings even after the chicken pox is gone. This usuallycauses no problems. If the virus reactivates in one of the nerveendings, however, it causes a rash all along the distribution of thenerve. The rash of herpes zoster is characterized by being painfuland being in a line totally on one side of the body. If it extendspast the midline of your body, the rash is probably coming fromsomething else. If the pain persists after the rash is gone, contin-uing for weeks to years (over one year in half of elderly patients),it is called postherpetic neuralgia (PHN). The pain tends to be burn-\ning, electric, or deep and aching. PHN affects between \ufb01ve hun-dred thousand and one million Americans, most of whom areelderly. It can severely disrupt one\u2019s life, but fortunately can nowbe effectively treated in most cases.\nPainful Diabetic Neuropathy (PDN)\nPDN is the most common cause of neuropathy in the UnitedStates. Alterations in sensation are common, and the feet, whichare most often affected, may feel both numb and painful at thesame time. Many factors contribute to nerve injury in diabetes,including decreased circulation, damage from elevated sugars,accumulation of toxic by-products, and nutritional de\ufb01ciencies.There are also changes in pain receptors.FOCUSING ON NERVE PAIN\n77", "Research has shown that many people who are labeled as hav-\ning diabetic neuropathy actually experience neuropathic paincaused by vitamin B \u2086or B \u2081\u2082de\ufb01ciency. In addition, the nutrient\ninositol has been shown to improve nerve function. The nutrientlipoic acid has also been shown to be very helpful for diabeticnerve pain.\nNutritional De\ufb01ciencies\nNeuropathic pain can also be caused by de\ufb01ciencies of vitaminsB\u2081, B \u2086, B \u2081\u2082, and E and zinc. A number of studies have shown that\ndifferent kinds of nerve pain can improve by supplementationwith high-dose B vitamins. Excess vitamin B \u2086(over 500 mg a day\nfor years), however, can also cause neuropathy.\nIn patients with long-standing shingles pain, one study showed\nthat taking 1,600 units of vitamin E (use the natural form) dailybefore a meal for six months was markedly helpful in eliminatingthe pain. Another study showed that taking lower doses for lessthan six months was not effective.\nHormonal De\ufb01ciencies\nHormonal de\ufb01ciencies, especially an underactive thyroid, can alsocause neuropathic as well as muscular pain. A therapeutic trial ofthyroid hormone is reasonable for anybody who has the symptomsof low thyroid including fatigue, cold intolerance, achiness, havinglow body temperatures, or unexplained inappropriate weight gain.\nNerve Entrapments\nA pinched nerve can cause nerve pain in many places in the body.T wo of the more common ones are low back pain from sciaticaand pains in the hand and sometimes wrist from carpal tunnel syn-drome. Sciatica usually goes away without surgery by using intra-venous colchicine, and carpal tunnel syndrome usually resolvesafter six to twelve weeks with vitamin B \u2086(250 mg a day), thyroid\nhormone, and wrist splints (see Chapter 10).EVALUATING AND TREATING COMMON TYPES OF PAIN\n78", "Trigeminal Neuralgia\nAlso known as tic douloureux , trigeminal neuralgia causes excruci-\nating attacks of pain in the lips, gums, cheek, or jaw. It usuallyoccurs in the middle-aged and elderly and seldom lasts more thana few seconds or minutes. The painful attacks recur frequentlythroughout the day and night for several weeks at a time. They canbe triggered by stimulating certain areas on the face. T egretol elim-inates the pain in 75 percent of patients. Begin with 100 mg a day(taken with food), increasing slowly up to 200 mg four times a dayas needed. Other treatments listed in the next section can also behelpful. If these treatments fail, surgical options are available.\nTreating Neuropathic Pain\nNeuropathic pain occurs biochemically, making it a very \ufb02uid sys-tem that can often be quickly modi\ufb01ed, resulting in pain relief.Many different chemicals (neurotransmitters) in your body maybe involved in your pain, and therefore it is worth trying differ-ent types of medications to see which ones work best in your case.For many, treating the nutritional and thyroid de\ufb01ciencies andeliminating the muscle spasms that are compressing the nervesmay be enough to eliminate the pain. Others may need to takemedications to suppress the pain while looking for ways to elim-inate the underlying cause. The best way to tell which chemicalsare involved in your nerve pain is to simply try different medica-tions (individually and, if needed, in combination) to see whateases your pain. Basically, it is like trying on different shoes to seewhat \ufb01ts best. The good news is that we have a large assortmentof \u201cshoes\u201d that you can try on and that are likely to help you.\nIt is, of course, critical to begin by eliminating the underlying\ncauses of neuropathy and giving the nerves what they need toheal. This includes the nutritional support I\u2019ve discussed in Chap-ter 2. In addition, the involvement of free radicals in nerve exci-tation was found in 1995, supporting the use of antioxidants inFOCUSING ON NERVE PAIN\n79", "nerve pain. Since that time, the antioxidant lipoic acid (300 mg\nthree times a day) has been shown to be helpful in diabetic neu-ropathy and should be tried in other neuropathies as well. Y ouwill be amazed at how much bene\ufb01t you may get over time sim-ply from optimizing nutritional support.\nIn addition, if you are tired, are cold intolerant, experience\nachiness, have low body temperature, or have gained weight, Ithink it is reasonable to consider a therapeutic trial of natural thy-roid hormone regardless of your blood levels. It may take three tosix months for the thyroid and/or nutritional therapies to beginworking, but regardless of the cause of your neuropathy, thistreatment may result in nerve healing. It is reasonable to beginmedications along with the nutritional support so that you can getpain relief as quickly as possible. If only a small area is involved,it makes sense to begin with a Lidocaine patch. Otherwise, I pre-fer to begin with Neurontin and/or tricyclic antidepressants. Allof the recommended oral nutrients discussed in this chapter,except lipoic acid and the 1,600 unit megadose of vitamin E, arecontained in the Energy Revitalization System vitamin powderand B-complex. For carpal tunnel syndrome, add 200 mg of B\n6to\nthe powder.\nLet\u2019s look at each of the different categories of treatments that\ncan be helpful for nerve pain. Begin with the nutritional and thy-roid support, and then you can add the following medications inthe order that they\u2019re listed.\nLidocaine Patch\nThis Novocain-like patch (5 percent) is applied directly over thearea of maximum pain. It can be cut to \ufb01t the area, and up to fourpatches can be used at a time (although the package insert saysonly three). It is left on for twelve hours and then removed fortwelve hours each day, although recent reports have suggested thatthe patch can be left on up to eighteen hours and still be safe andeffective. Results will usually be seen within two weeks. BecauseEVALUATING AND TREATING COMMON TYPES OF PAIN\n80", "the effect is local, side effects are minimal. The most common side\neffect is a mild skin rash from the patch. It should not be used ifyou have an allergy to Novocain/lidocaine.\nThe patches are most likely to be helpful if the pain is local-\nized to a moderately sized area. Even in a large area, however,patches can be used on the most uncomfortable spots. The maindownside of the patches is that they are expensive. If you haveprescription insurance, however, they will usually be covered.\nNeurontin and Other Seizure Medications\nNewer antiseizure medications, and some of the older ones, canalso be very helpful for neuropathic pain. Neurontin has beenshown to be helpful for both shingles and diabetes pain. Commonside effects include sedation, dizziness, and sometimes mildswelling in the ankles when \ufb01rst starting therapy. These sideeffects can often be avoided by starting with a low dose and rais-ing the dose slowly. A common total dose for Neurontin is 600mg, three to four times a day.\nTricyclic Antidepressants\nTricyclic antidepressants include medications such as Elavil,T ofranil, nortriptyline, or doxepin. T ofranil may be more effec-tive than Elavil. Sedation, constipation, dry mouth, and weightgain are the most common side effects, although dizziness can alsooccur. Other side effects include urinary retention, sweating, andabnormal heart rhythms. As most of the bene\ufb01t occurs with the\ufb01rst 10 to 50 mg, and most of the toxicity occurs with higherdoses, if adequate relief is not attained at a low dose, beforeuncomfortable side effects occur, I then add the next treatment orswitch to another tricyclic instead of pushing the dose to higherlevels. If it gave no bene\ufb01t, I would, of course, stop the tricyclicswhen I began the next treatment. These can be very helpful fornerve pain and have the added bene\ufb01t of being inexpensive (if youbuy the generic form of the drug).FOCUSING ON NERVE PAIN\n81", "Although antidepressants can be helpful for pain, even if no\ndepression is present, they seem more likely to help nerve painwhen they also raise adrenaline (norepinephrine) and not justserotonin. For example, the medication Effexor reduced diabeticnerve pain by 75 to 100 percent in one open study of elevenpatients. I recommend use of Effexor early in your treatment ifyou have depression associated with your pain. Higher doses(225 mg a day) seem more effective for nerve pain than the lowerdoses used for depression.\nTopical Gels or Creams\nA wonderful new addition to the treatment of pain in general, andespecially nerve pain, is the use of prescription topical gels orcreams. New gels have been developed that markedly increase theabsorption of medications through the skin. By using a low doseof many different medications in the cream, one can get a pow-erful effect locally with minimal side effects. It is best to have aknowledgeable compounding pharmacist guide you and yourphysician in the prescribing of these creams and gels. (See Appen-dix B for help in \ufb01nding a compounding pharmacy.)\nFor example, studies have shown that for long-standing, per-\nsistent nerve pain (average thirty-one months) that occurs aftershingles (postherpetic neuralgia, or PHN), using a 5 percent Ket-amine gel applied two to three times daily over the painful skinareas decreased pain signi\ufb01cantly in 65 percent of cases\u2014usuallywithin days and without side effects, except for occasional mildskin irritation. Other studies have also found topical Neurontin,opioids, and capsaicin to be effective. Lidocaine patches resultedin a highly signi\ufb01cant decrease in pain, which was seen withinone week. I \ufb01nd the Lidocaine patches to be more effective thanthe Lidocaine topical gels.\nTo explore an example of how to treat with these cr eams com-\nbined with nutritional support, let\u2019s use the example of diabeticneuropathy. One must, of course, begin with proper control ofEVALUATING AND TREATING COMMON TYPES OF PAIN\n82", "the elevated blood sugar. Nutritional support with high levels of\nvitamin B \u2086, vitamin B \u2081\u2082, and inositol are important in diabetic\nnerve pain as are many other nutrients, such as vitamins C and E,magnesium, antioxidants, and bio\ufb02avonoids. In addition, lipoicacid 300 mg three times a day has been shown to be helpful fordiabetic neuropathy. A compounded gel containing Ketamine 10percent, Neurontin 6 percent, clonidine 2 percent, and nifedipineshould be added to painful areas (apply 1 gram three times a dayas needed). The nutritional support can actually make the pain goaway over time, while the cream/gel can add symptomatic relief.Other medications discussed in this chapter can then be added asneeded to assist in the neuropathic pain.\nAnother excellent cream for neuropathic pain is a combination\nof lidocaine 10 percent, amitriptyline 7 percent, Ketamine 5 per-cent, and T egretol 7 percent used two to four times a day asneeded. If results are not seen within fourteen days, speak withthe compounding pharmacist (or your physician if he or she isfamiliar with pain creams) about modifying what is in the cream.Start with having the pharmacist make up relatively small amountsof the cream until you \ufb01nd a mix that works well for you.\nAlthough it is generally not recommended that the gels be\nused under occlusion (putting plastic wrap or a patch over the gelto force it into the skin) because this may raise blood levels of themedications causing side effects, I think the bene\ufb01t of increasedeffectiveness may outweigh the risks. I feel it is reasonable to putthe Lidocaine patch over an area where you have applied the paingels once the gel has dried. If you get unacceptable side effects,remove the patch and use the patch and creams/gels separately.\nUltram (Tramadol)\nUltram is an interesting medication that works on many areas ofpain and in many different types of pain. It has been shown to beeffective for nerve pain in a placebo-controlled study after fourweeks. It blocks both norepinephrine and serotonin reuptake andFOCUSING ON NERVE PAIN\n83", "also stimulates the narcotic receptors. Main side effects include\ndizziness, nausea, constipation, sedation, and light-headedness onstanding. These are more likely to occur when the dose is raisedrapidly. Lower doses should be used with antidepressants andother medications that can raise your serotonin levels.\nBegin with a dose of 50 mg one to two times daily and\nincrease to a maximum of 100 mg four times a day. Most people\ufb01nd that 100 mg twice daily is wonderful and higher doses causeuncomfortable side effects.\nAdditional Drug Treatments for Nerve Pain\nAlthough the medications previously listed are the ones that I usemost commonly for nerve pain, there are many other treatmentsthat can also be helpful (see Chapter 13). These include T opamax,Cymbalta, Lamictal, Zana\ufb02ex, Gabitril, Keppra, Trileptal, Dilan-tin, capsaicin, narcotics, amantadine, Zonegran, and Benadryl.\nSaint-John\u2019s-Wort for Nerve Pain\nSaint-John\u2019s-wort is best known for its effectiveness in the treat-ment of depression. It has, however, also been found to be help-ful for some people in treating neuropathic pain. In one studyusing approximately 1,000 mg a day of Saint-John\u2019s-wort for \ufb01veweeks, approximately 20 percent of the subjects had a goodresponse. For treating neuropathies, I would recommend taking600 mg three times a day for six weeks. At that time you candecide whether the bene\ufb01ts justify staying on it.\nRe\ufb02ex Sympathetic Dystrophy (RSD)\nRe\ufb02ex sympathetic dystrophy (RSD) is a nasty and chronic paindisorder affecting as many as 1.5 million Americans. It oftenbegins with severe pain in one hand or foot. It is also referred toas complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS). It usually manifestsas horribly severe pain in one hand or foot but can certainly spreadelsewhere. When I \ufb01rst meet a patient, and I see that he or sheEVALUATING AND TREATING COMMON TYPES OF PAIN\n84", "immediately moves her hand or foot out of the way to be sure that\nit is not touched, I quickly inquire about symptoms suggestingRSD.\nThe Re\ufb02ex Sympathetic Dystrophy Association of America\nde\ufb01nes the disorder as a multisystem, multisymptom syndromethat usually affects one or more extremities and can affect theentire body. There are many pain patterns, but the pain is oftenvery severe and much greater than one would expect from theprecipitating injury. Any number of traumas, including accidents,fractures, surgery, or even mild injuries such as IV insertions, cantrigger RSD in one\u2019s hands or feet. Interestingly, injury of the hipcan cause foot pain, and injury in the shoulder can cause handpain. A heart attack can also trigger RSD in the hand. Pain is usu-ally burning or stinging, and the skin has exquisite sensitivity toeven the lightest touch. It is sometimes associated with swelling,color and temperature chan ges in that hand or foot, and unusual\nsweating. Muscle spasms, tremor, and/or weakness may also bepresent. Although it is classically considered to affect just oneextremity, according to one survey as many as 70 percent of peo-ple with RSD had noted spreading of pain beyond the hand orfoot to other parts of the body.\nThe most common pattern of spread is for pain to move over\nthe same extremity. It may continue to spread or move to theopposite extremity or other distant sites. Early diagnosis withprompt treatment may result in the problem being more easilyreversed.\nCombining Treatments for Effectiveness\nMany pain specialists use a combination of treatments, includingphysical therapy, medication, electrical nerve stimulation, nerveblocks, and/or emotional support with counseling. It is best toavoid surgery or further injury to the area, if at all possible, as itwill usually result in worsening of the symptoms. Casting andimmobilization can also worsen symptoms and should be avoidedas well. Unfortunately, there\u2019s no de\ufb01nitive test for the illness asFOCUSING ON NERVE PAIN\n85", "nerve pain does not show up on x-rays or standard diagnostic tests.\nBecause of this, most people with RSD have not been properlydiagnosed, resulting in further psychological trauma. The level ofpain can be anywhere from mild to devastating. Patients some-times choose to have the extremity amputated because of thepain, only to \ufb01nd that the pain still persists! In addition, it is sus-pected that people who have had RSD once are at greater risk ofdeveloping it again with future injury.\nThe good news is that in addition to new treatments, there is\nalso a simple preventive measure. In one study of 123 adults withwrist fractures, half of the patients were given 500 mg of vitaminC daily and the other half were given placebo for \ufb01fty days. RSDoccurred in 22 percent of the patients in the placebo group, butonly 7 percent of the vitamin C group.\nFor more information on RSD, visit the website of the RSD\nSyndrome Association of America at rsd.org.\nAn Exciting New Treatment Approach for RSD\nAlthough the treatments discussed for neuropathic pain can alsobe helpful in RSD, because of the severity of this illness and thefact that it often does not respond to other treatments, I am veryexcited about a new treatment approach. This involves the use ofKetamine, an anesthetic. Unfortunately, many patients experiencethe side effect of intoxication, including hallucinations, whichmay be uncomfortable. This problem can be avoided in most casesby giving the Ketamine as a topical gel. In one study of \ufb01vepatients with refractory re\ufb02ex sympathetic dystrophy, pain wastemporarily relieved by 65 to 100 percent within three minutesof applying Ketamine gel (1 to 9 mg Ketamine per kilogram ofbody weight) to the painful area without signi\ufb01cant side effects.All patients chose to continue treatment. The dose needed tomaintain the bene\ufb01t ranged from 50 to 600 mg, three to six timesdaily.\nSince this study was conducted, reports have been published\nof permanent elimination of severe RSD using an IV infusion ofEVALUATING AND TREATING COMMON TYPES OF PAIN\n86", "Ketamine continuously for six days. The IV Ketamine was started\nin one patient at 10 mg per hour and increased by 10 mg per hourevery two hours as tolerated, with the maximum infusion rate of30 mg per hour. A higher dose was not used, as the patient wishedto remain \u201cin control\u201d without being overly intoxicated from themedication. By day three her pain was decreasing, and by day \ufb01veit was gone. Cessation of the pain continued after the treatmentwas stopped. This medication holds great promise for the treat-ment of this devastating problem.\nDr. Argo, a pain specialist at the Pain Management Center at\nColumbia Rose Medical Center, Denver, has found that Paxil canbe helpful for re\ufb02ex sympathetic dystrophy where other SSRIs arenot. In another clinic, a combination of Neurontin and clonidinecreams decreased RSD pain by one-third.FOCUSING ON NERVE PAIN\n87", "This page intentionally left blank ", "When In\ufb02ammation\nLeads to Pain\nIn\ufb02ammation is your body\u2019s response to what it perceives to be an\noutside invader or irritant (for example in gout). When caused byinfections, the in\ufb02ammation can sometimes be rather obvious, asoccurs with pneumonia. Other times, it can be very subtle. Keepin mind the following key points regarding in\ufb02ammation and pain:\n\u2022Treat the underlying infections or irritants when possible.\n\u2022Often the in\ufb02ammation causes more harm than good. It is\noften worthwhile to simply decrease the in\ufb02ammation usingnatural remedies, nutrients, ultra low-dose cortisol, and anti-in\ufb02ammatories such as aspirin and Motrin familymedications.\n\u2022Sometimes the in\ufb02ammation is obvious because it causesredness, heat, and swelling. At other times, it can be quitesubtle and needs to be looked for.\nThere are many different autoimmune and in\ufb02ammatory ill-\nnesses. Lupus (systemic lupus erythematosus, or SLE) is a common\nautoimmune disease that often results in signi\ufb01cant fatigue andpain. What most rheumatologists don\u2019t realize is that the second-ary \ufb01bromyalgia caused by lupus and many other rheumatologicCHAPTER5\n89\nCopyright \u00a9 200 6 by Jacob  Teitelbaum . Click here for terms of use.  ", "diseases (including rheumatoid arthritis) may be a source of many,\nif not most, of the symptoms and much of the disability in thesepatients. Flaring \ufb01bromyalgia may also be misinterpreted as a \ufb02ar-ing of lupus or other in\ufb02ammatory disease activity. In addition,both of these illnesses can be associated with marked vitamin Dde\ufb01ciencies. Vitamin D de\ufb01ciency has also been associated withmuscle pain.\nWhen one treats the associated \ufb01bromyalgia, patients often\n\ufb01nd that their lupus is actually a minimal problem. In addition,several studies have shown that taking DHEA, 200 mg a day, sig-ni\ufb01cantly improves the outcome of lupus and allows the patientto get by with a lower dose of prednisone. The main side effectsof a too-high DHEA level are darkening of facial hair and acne.If either of these occurs, lower the dose. It is unnecessary to fol-low blood levels of DHEA at this dose because this is a very highdose and you can assume the blood level will be high. Lowerdoses, however, are not as effective as 200 mg a day. As many, ifnot most, in\ufb02ammatory and/or autoimmune illnesses can cause asecondary \ufb01bromyalgia, and \ufb01bromyalgia is now treatable, it isimportant to keep this possibility in mind. If you have widespreadpain, fatigue, and insomnia, look for and treat the associated\ufb01bromyalgia!\nWhen In\ufb02ammation Is Unhealthy\nIn\ufb02ammation is part of our natural healing process. Wheneverthere is injury, our body puts out cytokines in the injured area tobring in white blood cells to knock out any infections and bringin other cells to begin the healing process. Because of this, healthyin\ufb02ammation is a very bene\ufb01cial tool that our body uses to heal.The cells come in, eliminate any infections, \ufb01x the problem, andthen dissipate. When healthy, in\ufb02ammation is almost always local-ized and short-term.\nIn\ufb02ammation can become unhealthy, however. In these situa-\ntions it is often generalized throughout the body. In addition toEVALUATING AND TREATING COMMON TYPES OF PAIN\n90", "causing pain and disability, it can also cause premature aging. As\nmentioned earlier, anytime you see the suf\ufb01x -itisat the end of the\nword, it tells you that unhealthy in\ufb02ammation is present. Excessin\ufb02ammation is very common. For example:\n\u2022Over 40 million Americans have arthritis. The in\ufb02ammation\ncan then damage the joints, causing deformity.\n\u2022Allergic rhinitis, which causes swelling of the nasal passages,\nis also common, affecting approximately 40 millionAmericans.\n\u2022Gastritis and colitis cause abdominal pain.\n\u2022Dermatitis, including psoriasis and eczema, are in\ufb02ammatory\nillnesses of the skin.\n\u2022Alzheimer\u2019s disease and heart disease have been associated\nwith increased in\ufb02ammation.\n\u2022Asthma, with its associated bronchitis, is an in\ufb02ammatory\ncondition\u2014and one that has doubled in frequency duringour lifetime. In treating allergies and asthma, we sometimesmistakenly focus on the trigger. But the trigger is not themain problem because most people don\u2019t have problemswhen they come in contact with that trigger. It is moreimportant to look at the cause of the overall reactivity ineach individual.\nThe Link Between Diet and In\ufb02ammation\nWe are now beginning to understand why we are so much moreprone to in\ufb02ammation these days than we were in the past. Cluesfor understanding this can be found by looking at how the mod-ern diet has changed over the last several thousand years.\nOur body\u2019s armies of in\ufb02ammation are often on high-alert\nwhen they don\u2019t have to be. Much of this occurs because of thehigh amounts of animal fats relative to \ufb01sh and vegetable oils in ourdiets. Land animal fats tend to contain arachadonic acid (in theomega-6 fatty acids family), which stimulates in\ufb02ammation. FishWHEN INFLAMMATION LEADS TO PAIN\n91", "oils and some vegetable oils, such as \ufb02axseed, contain what are\ncalled omega-3 fatty acids. These decrease in\ufb02ammation. Over thelast few hundred years, we have markedly decreased anti-in\ufb02ammatory omega-3 fatty acids and increased pro-in\ufb02ammatoryomega-6 fats in our diet. This often results in our bodies being onin\ufb02ammatory overdrive.\nResearch shows that prehistoric hunter-gatherers were much\nless likely to have degenerative diseases; their main problems wereinfection and trauma. They had a high-protein, high\u2013c omplex-\ncarbohydrate, and high-\ufb01ber diet. Most important, their diet washigh in omega-3 fatty acids and low in in\ufb02ammation-stimulatingomega-6 fatty acids (fats from meat, saturated and trans fats, short-ening, margarines, and grains). Their diet was also high in antiox-idants, nutrients that put out the in\ufb02ammatory \u201c\ufb01res.\u201d Foods werealso unprocessed and low in re\ufb01ned sugar.\nAs society became more farming-based, our diet included more\ngrains, and cattle were more likely to be grain fed. All this resultedin higher levels of the omega-6 pro-in\ufb02ammatory fats. Theseomega-6 fats stimulated cytokines and in\ufb02ammation. At this time,in\ufb02ammation began to increase. This problem has been seen oncebefore in recorded history in ancient Egypt. This civilization alsohad the osteoporosis and in\ufb02ammatory diseases seen today.\nOur current diet has continued to degenerate to where we are\ngetting as much as twelve to twenty times as many in\ufb02ammatoryfats in the diet as we used to! In addition, we have a massiveamount of sugar, potatoes, and white \ufb02our in our diet. This stim-ulates insulin resistance and release, further increasing the pro-duction of pro-in\ufb02ammatory hormones (arachadonic acid) fromthese omega-6 fats. At the same time, our intake of antioxidantsto put out these \ufb01res has markedly decreased.\nTreating In\ufb02ammation\nExcess in\ufb02ammation has been associated not just with anincreased tendency to pain, but at times with increases in heartEVALUATING AND TREATING COMMON TYPES OF PAIN\n92", "attacks and other diseases as well. Y ou can sometimes see this ten-\ndency to over-in\ufb02ammation in yourself when you get a paper cut.Sometimes the paper cut heals so quickly that you barely noticeit\u2019s there. At other times, the same type of cut will be red andin\ufb02amed and will continue to hurt beyond the initial few secondsof the cut.\nFor acute injury, remember the old standbys. These go by the\nacronym RICE, which stands for rest, ice, compression, and ele-vation. These are the standard treatments recommended bycoaches, trainers, and other professionals to treat muscle or jointinjuries such as sprains or strains. When combined with enzymessuch as Megazyme or Ultrazyme and homeopathic creams such asTraumeel (one of several wonderful products for traumatic injuriesthat contains arnica), acute injuries heal much more quickly.Adding another supplement called MSM can help when tissuehealing is necessary (for example with sprains or broken bones).The vitamin powder can give overall support for healing as well.\nMedical Approaches\nMedically, anti-in\ufb02ammatories like Motrin and Celebrex can beused to block conversion of the omega-6 fats to the pro-in\ufb02ammatory cytokines by blocking the enzyme cyclooxygenase(COX). Y ou can decrease your tendency to excess in\ufb02ammationby using steroids such as prednisone or the nonsteroidal anti-in\ufb02ammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Unfortunately, both of these canbe fairly toxic, and they also block your body\u2019s ability to makeanti-in\ufb02ammatory messengers. This is one reason why over16,000 Americans a year die from NSAIDs and approximately139,000 have had heart attacks or strokes from Vioxx. High-dosesteroids can be used as anti-in\ufb02ammatories, but used long term,they can be highly toxic. Other treatments include new tumornecrosis factor blocking medicines for rheumatoid arthritis thatcost thousands of dollars a year. We focus on prescription med-ications because that\u2019s where the money is\u2014so the pharmaceuti-cal industry makes sure that we learn about them!WHEN INFLAMMATION LEADS TO PAIN\n93", "Natural Alternatives That Are Safe and Effective\nIn the long run, using diet and nutrition is a much safer and more\neffective way to get your in\ufb02ammatory system into balance. Arecent study, for example, showed that taking a multivitamin canreduce in\ufb02ammation with vitamins C and B\n6seeming to play the\nlargest role. Many other natural therapies are also helpful indecreasing in\ufb02ammation.\nSubstituting olive oil for other oils can also be very helpful.\nWhen you\u2019re shopping for meat, go to Whole Foods Market, WildOats, Sprouts, or a similar store where you can get free-rangechicken and grass-fed beef. Although it is a bit more expensive, ittastes much better, may not make you put on as much weight, andwill save you a fortune on doctor bills. Olive oil is also tasty andcan be used for frying and cooking as well as a substitute for but-ter on your bread.\nIn addition, increasing \ufb01sh, nuts and seeds, berries, free-range\nchicken and grass-fed meats, spices and herbs, and green leafy veg-etables (not potatoes and grains) can be a very helpful start. Formore information on this, there is an excellent book you can read,The In\ufb02ammation Syndrome: The Complete Nutritional Program toPrevent and Reverse Heart Disease, Arthritis, Diabetes, Allergies, andAsthma by Jack Challem. In addition to this book, an excellent set\nof two cassette tapes will help you understand excess in\ufb02ammationin more detail. In\ufb02ammation and Aging (tapes 1 and 2) by Ronald\nE. Hunninghake, M.D., are available by calling 1-800-447-7276.\nDoes that mean you should only eat things that you hate? Of\ncourse not. Y ou may \ufb01nd that substituting a wide variety of nutssuch as peanuts, cashews, or walnuts for chips and sugary snacksactually tastes better. Eating more salmon and tuna is not a bigdeal if you like these. If you don\u2019t like them, don\u2019t eat them. Y oucan always add \ufb01sh oil instead. Take one-half to two tablespoonsdaily. When you feel better you may be able to drop to one tea-spoon a day.\nSubstitute stevia or saccharin for sugar. Use sugar-free choco-\nlates (Russell Stover makes a delicious line, and there are now anEVALUATING AND TREATING COMMON TYPES OF PAIN\n94", "enormous number of yummy sugar-free options for those on the\nAtkins diet). They taste just as good as foods with sugar but willnot make you sick. In addition, as a general rule of thumb, themore color ful a vegetable the healthier it is. For example, sweet\npotatoes or carrots are a lot healthier than white potatoes. Thevitamin powder will also supply extensive antioxidant support,simplifying the process dramatically.\nThe effects of treatment with diet are not subtle. In a study\ndone at the University of Washington, it was found that womenwho ate one or two servings of \ufb01sh a week were 22 percent lesslikely to have rheumatoid arthritis. Those who had more thantwo servings a week were 43 percent less likely. Those who haddeep-fried \ufb01sh (usually fried in omega-6 fats), however, weremore likely to have rheumatoid arthritis. In another study donein Scotland, sixty-four men and women with rheumatoid arthri-tis were given \ufb01sh oil. They began to feel better in three months.By one year, they had decreased NSAID medicine use by 40 per-cent. There is also evidence suggesting that \ufb01sh oil helps heal thejoints and may decrease osteoporosis as well.\nUnlike prescription medications, which can result in quick\nresults (but some such as steroids and NSAIDs cause long-termtoxicity), natural and dietary therapies take longer to see the fulleffect. They are more likely, however, to build up and heal yoursystem. I \ufb01nd that bene\ufb01ts usually start to be seen by six to twelveweeks and continue to build over years as the person gets health-ier and healthier. Because of this, I tend to use medications as aninitial \u201cBand-Aid,\u201d while the natural therapies heal the underly-ing problem over time.\nIn addition to using \ufb01sh oil, it can be very helpful to use the\nEnd Pain formula, which contains willow bark, boswellia, andcherry. These natural elements can wonderfully decrease bothpain and in\ufb02ammation (see Chapter 11).\nJust remember that if you have excess in\ufb02ammation, your body\ncan often repair the damage over time. This means decreasingsugar and simple carbohydrates (keep chocolate, but make it sugarWHEN INFLAMMATION LEADS TO PAIN\n95", "free), increasing protein and healthy oils (\ufb01sh, olive, nuts), and\ngetting optimal nutritional support (such as the vitamin powder).Y our dietary changes can actually be simple (similar to the Atkinsdiet but using healthy fats) and will leave you younger-looking,thinner, healthier, and feeling great!\nTreating Arthritis: In\ufb02ammation of the Joints\nAs we just discussed, in\ufb02ammation is a common cause of pain andmany other medical problems that we experience in Western soci-ety. For example, anything that ends in the suf\ufb01x -itismeans that\nthe problem is in\ufb02ammatory. This includes things like arthritis,tendonitis, bursitis, spondylitis, appendicitis, and so on. Manyin\ufb02ammatory problems cause a secondary \ufb01bromyalgia, whichmay be causing most of the symptoms. If you have widespreadpain, fatigue, and insomnia, look for and treat the associated\ufb01bromyalgia (see Chapter 6). Joint pain can also come from themuscles, tendons, and ligaments around the joint, even if x-raysare abnormal.\nOne type of joint pain, known as arthritis, comes in many\nforms. The most common type is osteoarthritis, known as \u201cwearand tear arthritis.\u201d The joints mainly affected by osteoarthritis arethe \ufb01nger, knee, and hip joints. This section will help you get ahandle on in\ufb02ammatory pain and other types of arthritic pain.\nA more severe form of arthritis is rheumatoid arthritis, which\nis in\ufb02ammatory and results in hot, swollen joints. It is an autoim-mune disorder that causes the body\u2019s immune system to attack thejoints. I suspect that infections are common triggers for thisattack. The American College of Rheumatology has de\ufb01ned thefollowing criteria for rheumatoid arthritis:\n\u2022Morning stiffness lasting more than one hour\n\u2022Arthritis and soft-tissue swelling in more than three of the\nfourteen joints or joint groups\n\u2022Arthritis of hand jointsEVALUATING AND TREATING COMMON TYPES OF PAIN\n96", "\u2022Symmetric arthritis\n\u2022Subcutaneous nodules\n\u2022Rheumatoid factor at a level above the 95th percentile\n\u2022Radiological changes suggestive of joint erosion\nAt least four of these criteria need to be met, although patients are\nsometimes treated despite not meeting these criteria. The child-hood form of this disease is called juvenile rheumatoid arthritis.Other types of arthritis include psoriatic arthritis, gouty arthritisand pseudo gout, systemic lupus erythematosus and other autoim-mune diseases, and hemochromatosis (excess iron).\nAs baby boomers begin reaching the age of retirement, the\nnumber of Americans developing arthritis-type disorders isexpected to soar. This increase will add to already signi\ufb01cantarthritis rates. According to the Centers for Disease Control(CDC), one out of four American adults has been diagnosed witharthritis and another 17 percent may be suffering from it withouthaving been diagnosed. In 2002, the percentage of those diag-nosed with one or more forms of arthritis (including rheumatoidarthritis and gout), lupus, or \ufb01bromyalgia ranged from a low of17.8 percent in Hawaii to a high of 35.8 percent in Alabama.Thirty-six million workdays are lost each year because of osteo-arthritis. A Centers for Disease Control arthritis expert stated thatthe number of cases of arthritis in America is huge compared tomost other diseases. Fortunately, there are many natural and pre-scription therapies that can be effective.\nHow Diet Can Help with In\ufb02ammatory Arthritis\nIn addition to using long-term antibiotic therapy with minocy-cline in rheumatoid arthritis, it is worth considering dietarychanges as well. Diet can play a major role in in\ufb02ammatory arthri-tis. A recent study tested the role of diet in sixty patients withrheumatoid arthritis. Thirty patients were given a standard Amer-ican diet and the other thirty an anti-in\ufb02ammatory diet low inmeat and high in \ufb01sh oil\u2014with supplements given to supplyWHEN INFLAMMATION LEADS TO PAIN\n97", "approximately 2 grams of omega-3 \ufb01sh oils daily\u2014for eight\nmonths. The patients on an anti-in\ufb02ammatory diet had a 28 per-cent decrease in the number of tender joints. In addition, decreas-ing in\ufb02ammation by giving borage seed oil (supplying 1.4 g ofGLA\u2014gamma linolenic acid) decreased the swollen joint scoreby 41 percent in the active group versus a 40 percent worseningin the placebo group. No patients had to withdraw because of sideeffects. Many other nutrients, including pantothenic acid, vitaminA, vitamin C, vitamin E, boron, copper, zinc, and selenium, havebeen found to be de\ufb01cient and/or helpful in the treatment ofrheumatoid arthritis. High doses of \ufb01sh oil (for example, one totwo tablespoons a day for at least three months) have been shownto be especially helpful in over six studies. As always, use \ufb01sh oilthat is mercury and lead free (see Appendix B).\nNatural Therapies for Treating Arthritis\nI prefer using natural rather than prescription therapies for osteo-arthritis. The most common prescription medications in use(NSAIDs like Motrin) kill over sixteen thousand Americansyearly and do not slow, and may actually hasten, the progressionof the arthritis. I recommend you begin with a natural treatmentprogram that will decrease in\ufb02ammation and help repair thejoints.\nThis natural treatment program has four main components:\n1. Repair\n2. Prevent damage3. Restore function4. Rule out and treat infections and food allergies\nRepair. The joint cartilage can be repaired using a combination of\nglucosamine sulfate, condroitin, and MSM. It is also critical thatyou get comprehensive nutritional support, as discussed earlier, topromote wound healing. Glucosamine, a cartilage compound thathas been shown to actually heal your joints, is as effective asEVALUATING AND TREATING COMMON TYPES OF PAIN\n98", "NSAIDs (Motrin and other anti-in\ufb02ammatory drugs). In addi-\ntion, a recent animal study showed that glucosamine and the anti-in\ufb02ammatory drugs work synergistically. This means that whenthe two are taken together, it is much more effective than simplytaking either one alone. Using glucosamine can therefore allowyou to stop the anti-in\ufb02ammatory drugs, or at least lower theneeded dose. This can improve the safety, effectiveness, and costof treatment dramatically.\nBecause of this, for tissue repair I recommend glucosamine\nsulfate, 500 mg, three times per day. Also consider MSM, 1.5 to3 grams a day for two to \ufb01ve months, and c hondroitin, although\nthese last two are less important. MSM supplies the sulfur aminoacids needed for healing in general. Although most of the researchon MSM and arthritis has not been placebo-controlled, two stud-ies were. One showed an 80 percent decrease in arthritis pain aftersix weeks using 1,500 mg in the morning and 750 mg at lunch-time. Another showed that glucosamine and MSM are synergis-tic for reducing pain and swelling in arthritic joints. One hundredand eighteen patients with mild to moderate osteoarthritis weretreated three times daily with either 500 mg of glucosamine, 500mg of MSM, a combination of both, or placebo. After twelveweeks, the researchers found that the combination treatment hada faster effect on decreasing pain and in\ufb02ammation compared toglucosamine or MSM alone.\nGlucosamine sulfate is a cartilage-building compound that has\nbeen found to be helpful in arthritis in many studies. Although itsexact mechanism of action is not yet fully understood, it is a majorcomponent of the cartilage that is damaged in arthritic joints. Glu-cosamine taken by mouth is incorporated in the molecules thatmake up this cartilage, likely contributing to the healing of arthri-tis. I recommend the sulfate form (as opposed to glucosaminehydrochloride) because the sulfate can also help with wound/jointhealing.\nUnlike aspirin/NSAIDs that do not slow down destruction of\njoints in arthritis, glucosamine has been shown to actually helpWHEN INFLAMMATION LEADS TO PAIN\n99", "stabilize, and often heal, the joints as shown on x-ray. Doses of less\nthan 1000 mg a day do not affect symptoms, and the standard doseis 500 mg three times a day. It can also be taken as 1,500 mg oncea day. It can be taken with or without food, and has no more sideeffects than placebo. C hondroitin sulfate is sometimes added to\nglucosamine or taken by itself. Its bene\ufb01ts are modest because lessthan 10 percent of it is absorbed, as opposed to 90 percent for glu-cosamine sulfate. Because of this, I rarely use chondroitin. On theother hand, certain forms (low molecular weight brands such asthe ones made by Integrative Therapeutics and Enzymatic Ther-apy) are better absorbed and are more effective (and more expen-sive). A dose of 1,200 mg a day can be helpful in slowing downarthritis and is worth trying if you do not get adequate relief withthe other treatments. It can be taken all at once or 400 mg threetimes a day with equal effectiveness.\nOverall nutritional support is also critical. For example, low\nconcentrations and low intake of vitamin D seem to be associatedwith an increased risk of progression of osteoarthritis of the knee.In addition, SAM-e can be helpful. This nutrient is produced frommethionine (an amino acid) in combination with multiple nutri-ents, including B vitamins, folate, and inositol. It was initiallytested and found to be effective in treating depression. Research-ers also noted that it improved patients\u2019 arthritis as effectively asanti-in\ufb02ammatory medications (NSAIDs). A number of studieswere done, including one that gave 600 mg a day for two weeksfollowed by 400 mg daily for two years. Pain and stiffnessdecreased within one week, and the improvement continuedthroughout the two-year trial. A study that reviewed seven otherstudies was inconclusive. A major problem with SAM-e productsis that they are not stable and break down easily, with many prod-ucts not really delivering what they claim. In addition, it is quiteexpensive. A better alternative is to take the nutrients your bodyneeds to make SAM-e. Combining the nutrients found in the vita-\nmin powder and B complex resulted in increased bl ood levels of\nSAM-e similar to those found in people taking 400 to 800 mg ofSAM-e daily.EVALUATING AND TREATING COMMON TYPES OF PAIN\n100", "These are only a few of many examples of the importance of\noverall nutritional support in treating arthritis. Dozens of otherimportant nutrients can help arthritis, including niacin, pan-tothenic acid, B complex, vitamin C, vitamin E, boron, selen ium,\nand zinc. As you can tell, it is important to get optimal nutritionalsupport. The vitamin powder makes this easy to do.\nPrevent Damage. I recommend a mix of several natural remedies,\nmany of which can be found in combination. The formulationthat I like the most combines boswellia, willow bark, and cherry.These are combined in an excellent new product called End Pain(see Appendix B). Using these three together can powerfullydecrease many kinds of pain while preventing damaging in\ufb02am-mation. Take two to four tablets three times a day until your painsubsides (approximately two to six weeks), and then you can oftenlower the dose to one tablet two to three times a day, or as needed.Curcumin can also be a healthful anti-in\ufb02ammatory but requiresthe addition of piperine from black pepper for the curcumin to beadequately absorbed. I do not generally recommend that you usethese if you take any prescriptions, however, because piperine maypotentially also increase the absorption of other medications,causing them to reach toxic levels. Fish oil, one-half to one table-spoon daily, also has strong anti-in\ufb02ammatory properties.\nRestore Function. Restore function with stretching, exercise, and\nheat. Exercise at least twenty minutes a day. Swimming, walking,and yoga are good choices. Use a heating pad or moist heat for upto twenty minutes at a time to give relief.\nDiet, exercise, and lifestyle can be important in the treatment\nand prevention of osteoarthritis. For example, losing elevenpounds will reduce a woman\u2019s risk of developing arthritis of theknee by 50 percent over a ten-year period. Adding exercise mayfurther decrease arthritis pain.\nRule Out and Treat Infections and Food Allergies. Food allergies\ncan aggravate arthritis. The best approach I have found for theWHEN INFLAMMATION LEADS TO PAIN\n101", "elimination of food and other sensitivities or allergies is a tech-\nnique called NAET. This technique combines acupressure withapplied kinesiology in a special way and is powerfully effective. Itcan eliminate one allergy per twenty-minute treatment. It got myattention when it knocked out my lifelong hay fever in a singletwenty-minute visit. (See the website naet.com.) I recommendthat you read Dr. Devi Nambudripad\u2019s book on pain and NAETfor more information.\nIf you also have osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis, I rec-\nommend using a spin-off of this technique called JMT (see jmt-jafmeltechnique.com for more information). For rheumatoid\narthritis, I also use long-term antibiotics (minocycline) because Ifeel this is an infectious disease in many cases, and research hasshown antibiotics to be effective.\nAnother food sensitivity issue to consider is that a small per-\ncentage of people with arthritis suffer aggravation of their arthri-tis from foods in the nightshade family. These include tomatoes,potatoes, eggplant, peppers, paprika, cayenne, and tobacco. I rarelyneed to have people consider this, but it is worth considering ifarthritis pain persists despite other treatments. Eliminate the abovefoods from your diet for one month. If you do not experiencerelief, reintroduce these foods to see if they affect your symptoms.Also avoid the arti\ufb01cial sweetener aspartame (NutraSweet).\nIn addition to these four treatment areas, although it may seem\nsilly, copper bracelets have actually been shown in a blindedcrossover study to be helpful in relieving arthritis, and I have alsoseen patients get better using them.\nAdditional Natural Therapies. As noted earlier, I recommend that\nyou begin with the End Pain formula and glucosamine/MSM/chondroitin. Y ou may also want to try another pop ular home\nremedy made with pectin and grape juice, Purple Pectin for Pain.(See directions for use under \u201cAn Easy-to-Make Home Remedy\u201din Chapter 11.)\nAlthough I prefer nutritional and herbal therapies, many\nhomeopathic treatments can also be helpful for arthritis\u2014espe-EVALUATING AND TREATING COMMON TYPES OF PAIN\n102", "cially if given by a well-trained homeopath. The concept of\nhomeopathy is that an extraordinarily diluted amount of a sub-stance does the opposite of a high dosage of the same substancewhen prepared properly. There have been a number of studiesshowing that this approach can be very helpful.\nPrescription Therapies\nPrescription therapies include NSAIDs such as Motrin, COX 2inhibitors (such as Celebrex), and Ultram. Because you and yourphysician are probably well aware of these, and they are discussedin Chapter 13, we will not go into more depth about them. Arecent study also showed that the Lidoderm patches were helpfulin decreasing pain by approximately 30 percent in two weeks,with many patients experiencing over a 50 percent drop in pain.Except for headache and an occasional skin rash where the patchwas applied, treatment was well tolerated.\nAlthough I have been using natural cortisol (Cortef\u2014by pre-\nscription) in doses of up to 20 mg daily for decades, some recentlytouted techniques adapt the protocol to use low-dose pulse thera-pies. The main concern with cortisol is that too high a dose can betoxic, and it also suppresses the adrenal glands. Doses of up to20 mg daily (approximately equal to 4 to 5 mg of prednisone butsafer) have been shown to be safe even when used for extendedperiods. If the arthritis persists despite natural therapies, it is worthtrying to give the Cortef in seven- to nine-day cycles as follows:\n\u2022On days one and two, give 20 mg twice a day.\n\u2022On days three and four, give 10 mg twice a day.\n\u2022On day \ufb01ve, give 5 mg twice a day.\n\u2022Take no Cortef for the next two to four days.\nKeep repeating the cycles, looking for bene\ufb01t to occur within\nthree months. At that time, you can try lowering the dose. Ifin\ufb02ammatory arthritis is present (and in severe cases even if it isnot), consider minocycline (an antibiotic), 100 mg twice a daylong term as discussed earlier.WHEN INFLAMMATION LEADS TO PAIN\n103", "This page intentionally left blank ", "Focusing on Muscle \nand Bone Pain\nWhile pain from \ufb01bromyalgia, myofascial pain syndrome, osteo-\npororis, and cancer may seem quite different, they do share com-mon treatment options. Focusing on one or all of four key areas ofgeneral pain management can be crucial to treating these pain syn-dromes that occur in the muscles and bones. For example, in\ufb01bromyalgia and myofascial pain, my double-blind, placebo-controlled study showed a 91 percent improvement rate whenthese four areas (getting seven to eight hours of sleep, taking nutri-tional supplementation, treating hormonal de\ufb01ciencies, and treat-ing infections) were addressed. (The full text of the study can alsobe seen on my website at vitality101.com.) For both treating andpreventing osteoporosis and bone loss, incorporating the rightnutrients and hormonal support is essential. Another thing to con-sider is that in addition to causing pain, cancer that has spread tobone can also make the bones weak and susceptible to fracture.Because of this, treatments that improve bone density (and preventosteoporosis) may decrease bone pain from cancer as well. In addi-tion, cancer often triggers muscle/myofascial pain, and using thetreatments for muscle pain can result in more comfort, the patientneeding less pain medicine, and, therefore, fewer side effects.CHAPTER6\n105\nCopyright \u00a9 200 6 by Jacob  Teitelbaum . Click here for terms of use.  ", "Myofascial and Fibromyalgia Pain\nFibromyalgia (FMS) and myofascial pain syndrome (MPS) occur\nwhen your muscles get stuck in the shortened position. In\ufb01bromyalgia, this also results in reversible changes in how yourbrain processes pain. In addition, \ufb01bromyalgia patients have sup-pression of a major control center in the brain called the hypo-thalamus. This is basically like blowing a fuse in your brain. As Imentioned earlier, the good news is that our research has shownthat 91 percent of patients can turn the hypothalamic \u201ccircuitbreaker\u201d back on by treating four key areas. Doing this can makeboth \ufb01bromyalgia and myofascial pain go away.\nThe four areas are discussed at length earlier in this book in\nChapters 2 and 3. (For an in-depth look at how to eliminate\ufb01bromyalgia and myofascial pain, I invite you to read my best-selling book From Fatigued to Fantastic! )\nThe Importance of Sleep When Treating FMS and MPS\nMost patients with these illnesses \ufb01nd that they are unable to get\nseven to eight hours of deep sleep a night without taking med-ications. In part, this occurs because hypothalamic function is crit-ical to deep sleep. For patients to get well, it is critical that theytake enough of the correct sleep medications to get eight to ninehours of sleep at night! These medications include Ambien,Desyrel, Klonopin, Xanax, Soma, and if you don\u2019t have restless legsyndrome, Flexeril and/or Elavil. In addition, natural remedies canhelp sleep. An excellent natural compound is the RevitalizingSleep Formula. In the \ufb01rst six months of treatment, it is notuncommon to require six to eight different products simultane-ously to get eight hours of sleep at night. After six to eighteenmonths of feeling well, most people can come off most sleep (andother) medications. (See Chapters 11 and 13 for more informa-tion on natural and prescription sleep aids.)\nI\u2019m starting to believe that, to offer a margin of safety during\nperiods of stress, it may be wise to stay on one-half to one tabletof a sleep medication or herbal for the rest of your life. Y our doc-EVALUATING AND TREATING COMMON TYPES OF PAIN\n106", "tor may initially be uncomfortable with this. Nonetheless, my\nexperience with more than two thousand patients and tworesearch studies has found this approach to be safe and critical topeople getting well. When one recognizes that \ufb01bromyalgia andits disabling cousin chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS/FMS) arehypothalamic sleep disorders\u2014not poor sleep hygiene\u2014thisapproach makes sense. Otherwise, it is as if your doctor wouldimmediately try to stop blood pressure or diabetes medicinesevery time the patient was doing better!\nNutritional Supplementation for FMS and MPS\nNutritional de\ufb01ciencies are widespread in \ufb01bromyalgia. I recom-mend taking the vitamin powder long term. I also recommendadding D-Ribose (Corvalen) 5 grams two to three times a day;NAC, 500 to 650 mg; coenzyme Q10 (use the Vitaline form),200 mg; and acetyl l-carnitine, 1,000 mg a day for three to fourmonths if you have \ufb01bromyalgia. These are all readily available.\nFMS, MPS, and Hormonal De\ufb01ciencies\nThe hypothalamus is the main control center for most of theglands in the body. Most of the normal ranges for blood tests werenot developed in the context of hypothalamic suppression.Because of this, and for a number of other reasons, it is usuallynecessary, albeit controversial, to treat with thyroid, adrenal (verylow dose Cortef, DHEA), and ovarian and testicular hormonesdespite normal blood tests. These hormones have been found tobe reasonably safe when used in low doses.\nFMS, MPS, and Unusual Infections\nMany studies have shown immune system dysfunction in\ufb01bromyalgia/CFS. Although there are many causes of this, I sus-pect that poor sleep is a major contributor. The immune dysfunc-tion can result in many unusual infections. These include viralinfections (HHV-6, CMV , and EBV), parasites and other bowelinfections, infections sensitive to long-term treatment with theFOCUSING ON MUSCLE AND BONE PAIN\n107", "antibiotics Cipro and Doxycycline (mycoplasma, chlamydia,\nLyme, and others), and fungal infections. Although controversial,both my study and another recent placebo-controlled study foundtreating with an antifungal to be very helpful with the symptomsseen in these syndromes. Avoiding sweets (stevia is OK) and tak-ing Acidophilus Pearls (a healthy milk bacteria), two pearls twicea day for \ufb01ve months, can be helpful. I often also add prescriptionantifungals as well.\nOther Helpful Fibromyalgia Treatments\nWhile treating the underlying causes of muscle pain that we dis-cussed previously, it is also helpful to have other treatments tokeep you comfortable. NSAIDs like Motrin are minimally effec-tive, only helping about 10 percent of \ufb01bromyalgia patients. Inter-estingly, Celebrex is more likely to be helpful\u2014despite havingsimilar mechanisms of action. Safety concerns have been raisedabout this family of medications as well, however. Other medica-tions that are very helpful include Ultram, Skelaxin, Neurontin,and Baclofen. Zana\ufb02ex has also been helpful in many patients, andmost only need a 4 mg tablet at bedtime. Another helpful nondrug\npain treatment that is currently being studied is Flexyx. This ther-apy is a brainwave biofeedback and treatment system. (See \ufb02exyx.com for more information.)\nTreating Osteoporosis and Bone Pain\nOsteoporosis, or decreased bone density/strength, can worsenwith age, inactivity, and hormonal de\ufb01ciencies (estrogen, testos-terone, and DHEA). Currently, the rate of osteoporosis amongolder women is estimated to be about 29 percent, yet only 13 per-cent of older women have been diagnosed with the disease.Osteoporosis can be easily diagnosed by performing a test calleda DEXA scan. Fortunately, many treatments can be effective atrestoring bone strength and eliminating osteoporosis pain.\nAlthough using calcium to increase bone density has received\nmost of the media attention, it is actually a rather small playerEVALUATING AND TREATING COMMON TYPES OF PAIN\n108", "when it comes to improving bone strength. In addition to weight-\nbearing exercise and natural estrogen, many other nutrients andtreatments can dramatically improve bone density and decreasebone pain. Sadly, except for calcium, most doctors only hear aboutexpensive prescriptions such as Fosamax and calcitonin (200 unitstwice a day\u2014used only in severe cases). Although these can behelpful, I would certainly start \ufb01rst by adding the nutrients thatyour body needs to make strong bones.\nWhen You Already Have Osteoporosis\nIf you already have osteoporosis, I would recommend Fosamax ora related medication in addition to the other treatments men-tioned in this section. The usual dose is 70 mg once a week on anempty stomach taken with a full glass of water. It is best to take itimmediately on waking and then stay upright for thirty minutesso gravity helps it get past the stomach quickly (it can irritate thestomach). If you are on the 35 mg a week prevention dose, youshould be aware that the 35 and 70 mg tablets cost exactly thesame amount; you can save half the cost by buying 70 mg tabletsand breaking them in two. The same price for both low- andhigh-dose tablets is commonly seen with many medications.\nAdditional Nutrients for Prevention and Treatment\nThere are many other nutrients that are critical for bone produc-tion. These include magnesium, boron, folic acid, copper, man-ganese, zinc, and vitamins B \u2086, B \u2081\u2082, D, and C. All of these are\npresent in the Energy Revitalization System vitamin powder (pre-viously discussed and included in Appendix B). In addition I rec-ommend adding the following important nutrients.\nCalcium. Take 1,000 to 1,500 mg of calcium daily. Be sure you get\na form of calcium that dissolves in your stomach. Unfortunately,most calcium tablets are chalk (calcium carbonate) and do not dis-solve. Because of this, they go in your mouth and out the otherend, doing no good along the way. If you get one that is a chew-able, powder, or liquid, this is not a problem. If you get a tablet,FOCUSING ON MUSCLE AND BONE PAIN\n109", "put it in some vinegar for an hour and see if it dissolves. If it does\nnot, it will not dissolve in your stomach either, and I recommendthat brand not be used.\nIf you are taking thyroid hormone supplements, do not take\nthe calcium within two to four hours of the thyroid hormone oryou will not absorb the thyroid hormone. In addition, make surethat your free T4 thyroid blood test (not the TSH test) is notabove the upper limit of normal because too high a thyroid dosecan cause osteoporosis. Y ou may choose to take your calcium atmeals and bedtime (500 mg at lunch, dinner, and bedtime)because it is better absorbed with food, and calcium taken at nightcan help you to sleep.\nStrontium. This mineral is highly effective at improving bone\ndensity. I am not speaking about strontium-90, the very danger-ous radioactive compound released during nuclear testing. Thestrontium available in health food stores and at vitality101.com isnonradioactive and very safe\u2014even in high doses. Studies usingstrontium in the treatment of 353 osteoporosis patients showed adramatic 15 percent increase in lumbar spine bone mineral den-sity (BMD) over two years in patients using 680 mg of strontium(2,000 mg of strontium ranelate) a day. They then repeated theplacebo-controlled study with 1,649 osteoporotic women. Newfractures decreased by 49 percent in the \ufb01rst year of treatment,and bone mineral density in the lumbar spine increased by anaverage of 14.4 percent after three years. There was an 8.3 per-cent increase in hip bone density as well. Overall, strontiumappears to be approximately 150 percent as effective as Fosamax.Other forms of strontium have shown similar bene\ufb01ts, and680 mg of elemental strontium daily appears to be a good dose.Strontium gluconate is better absorbed than strontium carbonate.\nIf possible, take the strontium on an empty stomach and at a\ndifferent time of day than the calcium, as calcium can blockstrontium\u2019s absorption. Early data also suggest that the strontiummay also be helpful in the treatment of osteoarthritis. Although itEVALUATING AND TREATING COMMON TYPES OF PAIN\n110", "took three to thirty-six months of therapy, taking strontium was\nassociated with a marked reduction in bone pain in osteoporosispatients. After three years, drop the dose of strontium to 340 mga day or take it as needed.\nFish Oil. Fish oil also may decrease osteoporosis. Y ou can either\nincrease your intake of salmon and tuna or take one to two tea-spoons of \ufb01sh oil a day. (Sources of \ufb01sh oil are listed in Appen-dix B.)\nHormonal Support for Osteoporosis\nMake sure that your DHEA and testosterone levels are optimizedsince these hormones also can improve bone density considerably.These are discussed in Chapter 2 in the section on hormonal de\ufb01-ciencies. Even very low dose transdermal (by patch) estrogenreplacement therapy improves bone density in menopausal women.\nEasing Cancer Pain and Discomfort\nIt is unacceptable for cancer patients to be in pain, and the treat-ments discussed in this book can be very helpful in eliminatingcancer pain. Most cancer pain comes from muscles, bones, ornerves. Treat these pains as discussed in earlier chapters. In addi-tion, nutritional de\ufb01ciencies are rampant in cancer patients andcan contribute markedly to the pain and disability. I strongly rec-ommend that most cancer patients take the vitamin powder (dis-cussed in Appendix B; lower the dose if diarrhea is present).\nAs an aside, there are many treatments that can help cancer that\nyour oncologist may not be aware of. I recommend that anypatient with a signi\ufb01cant cancer order a search of medical studiesdone on their speci\ufb01c type and stage of cancer from HealthResources, as they do a spectacular job. (Call Jan Guthrie at 800-949-0090 for more information.) This report routinely turns upvaluable treatment options that most doctors are not aware of. Ihave seen \u201cincurable\u201d cancers go away when the patient combinesFOCUSING ON MUSCLE AND BONE PAIN\n111", "the best of the standard and complementary therapies that are\nfound in the printout\u2019s studies. As an example, my research asso-ciate has now been cancer-free for over \ufb01ve years despite havinghad an ovarian cancer metastasize to her neck!\nIn addition, here are a few thoughts for easing nausea, a com-\nmon discomfort of cancer treatment. For uncontrollable nausea,use ABHR cream applied to an area of soft skin, such as the wrist.This prescription cream contains lorazepam, Benadryl, Haldol,and metoclopramide and can be made by a compounding phar-macist (who can also guide you in its proper use). Nausea oftensettles within \ufb01fteen to thirty minutes after applying the medica-tion. The cream can be reapplied every six hours as needed.Promethazine 25 mg per 0.5 cc of cream is also helpful for nausea.\nHow Bone, Muscle, and Nerve Pain Treatment Can Help\nwith Cancer Pain\nAs I mentioned at the beginning of the chapter, cancer that has\nspread to the bones can make them susceptible to fracture. In onestudy of patients with bone metastases from breast or prostatecancer, strontium gluconate (the healthy form\u2014not the radioac-tive one), 274 mg daily, increased bone regrowth in areas oftumor and often resulted in patients feeling better and gainingweight. I would use the 680 mg a day dose of strontiumgluconate.\nIn addition, a study by Dr. Neoh Choo Aun, a wonderful\nacupuncturist and friend in Taiwan, showed that using acupunc-ture to treat the trigger points (used to treat muscle pain) in can-cer patients was very bene\ufb01cial.\nIn another study of twelve patients with very severe neuro-\npathic pain due to the cancer pushing on major nerve centers, IVmagnesium was given. Half the patients received 500 mg and theother half 1,000 mg given over ten minutes. Aside from produc-ing a mild feeling of warmth at the time of the injection, the IVwas well tolerated. T en of the twelve patients experienced signif-icant relief that lasted approximately four hours. I would give 2EVALUATING AND TREATING COMMON TYPES OF PAIN\n112", "grams of magnesium over thirty to sixty minutes. Most patients\nwith neuropathic pain will not need this, although it can easily begiven if they have an IV in place, if they simply use the medica-tions we discuss in Chapter 4 on neuropathies.\nThe rest of the chapters in this section focus on pain based in spe-\nci\ufb01c locations in the body, such as headaches and back, chest,abdominal, and pelvic pains.FOCUSING ON MUSCLE AND BONE PAIN\n113", "This page intentionally left blank ", "It\u2019s Not All in Your Head:\nTreating Headaches \nand Facial Pain\nHeadaches are a major source of chronic pain. Although most\npeople get an occasional headache, as many as 45 million Ameri-cans get them on a regular basis. Headache-related lost work timeand medical expenses cost $50 billion per year in the United Statesalone. Over $4 billion a year is spent on over-the-counter head-ache relievers. Headaches are problematic in about 10 to 18 per-cent of the general population, and 10 percent of patientsidenti\ufb01ed headache as the reason for their doctor visits. This chap-ter provides the effective prescription and natural remedies thatcan help you eliminate both mild and severe chronic headaches.\nFinding Relief from Tension Headaches\nT ension headaches account for about three-quarters of all head-aches. They cause moderate pain on both sides of, and across, theforehead, tend to both start and fade away gradually, and are theresult of muscle tightness coming from the sternocleidomastoid(SCM) muscles in the neck. These muscles begin behind the bot-\n115CHAPTER7\nCopyright \u00a9 200 6 by Jacob  Teitelbaum . Click here for terms of use.  ", "tom of the ear and come around the neck to the top of the collar\nbone (clavicle). They are the muscles that turn your head fromside to side. With tension headaches you can often \ufb01nd a tenderknot right in the middle of the muscle. This knot, called a trigger\npoint, refers pain and tenderness to the sides of your forehead (the\ntemple area) and then sends the pain across your forehead.Although putting a hot compress or one of the pain creams on thetemples and across the forehead may help temporarily, they aremore effective when placed over the tender knots in the muscleson both sides of the neck.\nOccasionally, tension headaches are felt at the base of the skull,\non the top of the head, and/or behind the eyes. For these headaches,the pain is often coming from the muscles where they attach to thebase of the skull at the top of the back of your neck. If you push onthose muscles (called the suboccipital muscles) where they attach atthe base of the skull during a headache, they will be very tender,and pressure on them can make the headache better or worse.When the pain is reproduced by pushing on the area, you knowthat these muscles are part of the source of that headache. If this isthe case, use heat and the pain creams over those tender areas.\nBecause tension headaches are muscular, the treatments (dis-\ncussed previously in Chapter 6 on myofascial and \ufb01bromyalgiapain) that cause your muscles to relax will often eliminate therecurrence of these headaches. These are nutritional support, hor-monal support, getting at least eight hours of sleep at night, andtreating underlying infections. Paying attention to structural fac-tors (discussed in Chapter 3) can also help.\nNatural and Prescription Remedies\nHerbal remedies such as the End Pain formula (see Appendix B),which contains willow bark, boswellia, and cherry, can be veryhelpful for acute attacks as can natural and prescription pain gels(discussed in Chapters 11 and 13). Although the End Pain direc-tions say to take one or two tablets, for acute pains three or fourEVALUATING AND TREATING COMMON TYPES OF PAIN\n116", "tablets at a time can be more helpful. Using two to four capsules of\nthe Revitalizing Sleep Formula with the End Pain formula (or byitself ) can also be very effective, as these herbs are also muscle relax-ants (see Chapter 11). A physical therapy technique called stretchand spray (in which the muscles are stretched while using a coolantspray to block pain), which approximately 10 percent of physicaltherapists are familiar with, is also an excellent and pain-free wayto release your muscles and eliminate a tension headache. When theunderlying metabolic and structural factors have been treated,stretch and spray may result in permanent relief of the pain.\nIn addition, there are, of course, the old standbys of chiro-\npractic and bodywork as well as Tylenol and Motrin/Advil. Othermedications that can be quite helpful include Midrin and Ultram.I would begin with the natural therapies \ufb01rst, however, as I thinkthese are both more effective and much safer.\nPreventing Tension Headaches\nWhile you are treating the underlying causes of your muscle pain,many medications can also be used to prevent chronic tensionheadaches. Antidepressants can help headache and other pains aswell as depression. In one study comparing Elavil 25 mg at bed-time with Remeron 30 mg at bedtime, both groups had fewerheadaches but the Remeron group had fewer side effects. Both ofthese medications are likely to be more effective for tension head-aches than Paxil 40 mg daily, which had only a mild effect.\nGetting Rid of Migraines\nMigraine headaches can be very severe and often leave peoplecrippled for days. They may af\ufb02ict as many as 28 million Ameri-cans. Migraines are often preceded by an aura, which may consistof visual disturbances such as \ufb02ashing lights. The headaches areoften associated with nausea, sweats, dizziness, and slurred speech.Light and sound sensitivity can be severe.IT\u2019S NOT ALL IN YOUR HEAD: TREATING HEADACHES AND FACIAL PAIN\n117", "There is still marked debate over the cause of migraines. For\ndecades, researchers thought that migraines occurred because ofexcessive contraction and expansion of the blood vessels in thebrain. Others thought this blood vessel problem occurred becauseof inadequate serotonin, the neurotransmitter that controls sleepand mood, which also plays a role in how blood vessels expand.Low serotonin also ampli\ufb01es pain by increasing the pain neuro-transmitter called substance P . Muscle spasm and nutritionalimbalances and de\ufb01ciencies can also contribute to migraines, ascan food sensitivities. Most likely, migraines are a common end-point for many different underlying problems.\nEffective migraine treatment is important. Not only are\nmigraines horribly painful for many people, but they are expen-sive as well. The average amount of work missed by those withmigraines is 19.6 days a year, costing e mployers three thousand\ndollars per year per e mployee. It is also under-treat ed, with 31\npercent of migraine patients never having sought treatment.\nMigraine-Busting Medications\nIn the United States, medications in the Imitrex family stillremain the \ufb01rst choice for treating migraines. This new family ofmedications, called triptans, has dramatically increased our abil-ity to treat migraine headaches effectively. Imitrex comes in 25,50, and 100 mg tablets, and up to 100 mg may be taken at a time.If pain persists at two hours, another dose of up to 100 mg can betaken. In addition, it is also available by nasal spray, using a doseof up to 20 mg initially, followed by one more spray of up to20 mg two hours later if needed. Another alternative is a 6 mgsubcutaneous injection, which can also be repeated one hour laterif needed. It is reasonable to try these different forms to see whatworks best for your migraines.\nImitrex has been found to be effective in eliminating an acute\nmigraine attack in 34 to 70 percent of patients within two hours.Unfortunately, at least 30 to 40 percent of patients remainedunsuccessfully treated.EVALUATING AND TREATING COMMON TYPES OF PAIN\n118", "Y ou may also want to try a newer cousin called Amerge. Use\n2.5 mg initially. This dose may be repeated four hours later ifneeded. Y our physician may also use other related medicationssuch as Zomig or Relpax. Axert (almotriptan 6.5 to 12.5 mg,which can be repeated in two hours) is similar in effectiveness toImitrex but less expensive.\nOther treatments may be effective for acute migraines when\nImitrex is not. Aspirin-family medications do not work well inmigraines because the absorption of aspirin is delayed during themigraine attack. T o combat this problem, medications that enhanceabsorption can be added to the aspirin and/or it can be given bysuppository. For example, a combination of indomethacin (a \u201csuper-aspirin\u201d), prochlorperazine (for nausea and to enhance absorption),and caffeine in suppository form were compared with sumatriptanrectal suppositories for acute migraines. Forty-nine percent ofpatients given the indomethacin combination were pain-free at twohours on the \ufb01rst treatment as compared to 34 percent with theSumatriptan.\nAnother study using a similar approach had the same result.\nAspirin (lysine acetyl salicylates, 1,620 mg\u2014equivalent to 900 mgof aspirin) was combined with metoclopramide, 10 mg. The lat-ter medication returns the absorption of aspirin to normal duringmigraine attacks and also combats nausea and vomiting. In thetwo placebo-controlled studies, this combination was more effec-tive than 100 mg of Imitrex by mouth and was better tolerated.These combinations can be made by compounding pharmacists(see Appendix B). It is quite likely that regular aspirin, especiallyif chewed, would be as effective as the form used in the study.Metoclopramide is readily available.\nOther medications can also be helpful for acute migraines.\nMany patients get relief with Midrin, which is a mix of threemedications. Take two capsules immediately followed by one cap-sule every hour until the headache is relieved (to a maximum of\ufb01ve capsules within a twelve-hour period). It can also be helpfulfor tension headaches in a dose of two capsules up to four times aIT\u2019S NOT ALL IN YOUR HEAD: TREATING HEADACHES AND FACIAL PAIN\n119", "day, as needed. Many patients \ufb01nd this to be quite helpful, and it\nis not addictive. Fiorinal can also be effective but is addictive, andI prefer not to use this medication.\nA fascinating study can guide you as to when to use Imitrex-\nfamily medications versus when to use other therapies. At a recentAmerican Academy of Neurology meeting, Dr. Burstein of Har-vard Medical School noted that 75 percent of migraine patientsget painful sensitivity to normal touch (such as that from eye-glasses) around their eyes. This pain is created in a different partof the brain than the throbbing pain that gets worse with move-ment or coughing. The study found that if these patients useImitrex before they get the tenderness/pain around the eyes, itwill knock out the migraine 93 percent of the time. If the pain/tenderness around the eyes had already set in, Imitrex only elim-inated the migraine 13 percent of the time (although it still helpedthe throbbing). In other words, if you are one of the lucky oneswho does not get pain around the eyes, the Imitrex can knock outyour migraine at any time. If you are one of those who getspain/tenderness around the eyes, it is a race against the clock totake the Imitrex before that pain starts. This means that you needto take the Imitrex early in the attack (within the \ufb01rst \ufb01ve totwenty minutes), before the skin hypersensitivity gets established.For example, use it at the earliest warning signs like painful scalpor discomfort from wearing your glasses, shaving, or wearing ear-rings. If the pain has already fully set in before you take theImitrex, consider using one of the other acute treatments we\u2019vediscussed.\nBecause of the nausea and light/sound sensitivity, antinausea\nmedications can also be helpful. Phenergan or Compazine sup-positories are two such medications.\nNatural Remedies That Can Knock Out Migraines\nT wo natural treatments can knock out an acute migraine: butter-bur and magnesium. Y ou can take butterbur at home on yourown. This herb can both prevent and eliminate migraines. TakeEVALUATING AND TREATING COMMON TYPES OF PAIN\n120", "50 mg three times a day for one month and then 50 to 75 mg\ntwice a day to prevent migraines. Y ou can take 100 mg everythree hours to eliminate an acute migraine. Use only high-qualitybrands (see Appendix B). Many others that were tested had impu-rities and did not contain the amount of butterbur the labelclaimed (in other words, they don\u2019t work).\nThe development of standardized extracts of butterbur has led\nto a powerful new natural tool in both the prevention and treat-ment of migraine headaches. T wo randomized placebo-controlleddouble-blind studies have found it to be effective. In the \ufb01rststudy, sixty migraine patients received 50 mg of butterbur twicea day. By the twelfth week, there was a 60 percent decrease in thenumber of migraine attacks compared to the placebo group. Asecond study of 202 migraine patients, who were given 75 mg ofbutterbur twice a day, showed a 58 percent decrease at threemonths. The 100 mg a day group had a 42 percent decrease atthree months. About 20 percent of people taking the butterburnoted increased burping.\nMagnesium has also been found effective for migraines. In a\nhospital emergency room or a doctor\u2019s of\ufb01ce, 1 to 2 grams ofintravenous magnesium over \ufb01fteen to thirty minutes can effec-tively eliminate an acute migraine 86 percent of the time within\ufb01fteen minutes!\nWhen Nothing Else Works: Rescue Medications\nUnfortunately, sometimes the treatments discussed above are noteffective. Because of this, and largely because most people are notaware of all the treatment options, over eight hundred thousandAmericans per year visit hospital emergency rooms for treatmentof their migraines. This is an expensive proposition; it often runsmore than \ufb01ve hundred dollars per emergency room visit. Inaddition, the average time spent in the emergency room is fourhours. Because the person usually needs to have somebody drivehim or her, this can be multiplied by two. Therefore, it is helpfulfor people to have \u201crescue medication\u201d that they can use insteadIT\u2019S NOT ALL IN YOUR HEAD: TREATING HEADACHES AND FACIAL PAIN\n121", "of having to go to the emergency room. A number of options are\navailable to serve this purpose.\nOne such remedy is the use of fentanyl lollipops, known as\noral transmucosal fentanyl citrate (OTFC, Actiq). Fentanyl lol-lipops (Actiq) should be intermittently sucked on, not chewed orswallowed. In between being sucked on, the lollipop should beleft between the cheek and lower gum. Time the sucking so thatit takes approximately \ufb01fteen minutes for the medication to beabsorbed into your cheek. This makes it more effective. Actiqcomes in six strengths (200 to 1,600 mcg). It begins to workwithin \ufb01ve to ten minutes, with pain relief lasting approximatelythree hours. Its effectiveness is similar to 2 to 16 mg of intra-venous morphine. The most commonly used doses are 400 and800 mcg.\nBecause these medications are only approved by the FDA for\nuse in patients who are on chronic narcotics, it is reasonable (if youare not already on chronic narcotic pain medications) to take the\ufb01rst dose in a doctor\u2019s of\ufb01ce to make sure that it does not cause adangerous level of sedation. Like other narcotics, this medicationcan be highly habituating. Because of this, it should only be usedas a rescue medication when other medications have failed. Onceyou have tried the 200 and 400 mcg doses and know that they arenot too sedating, begin with a 400 mcg dose over \ufb01fteen minutes.If adequate pain relief is not achieved ten minutes later (that is,twenty-\ufb01ve minutes after beginning the \ufb01rst lollipop), use another200 or 400 mcg unit every twenty-\ufb01ve minutes until adequatepain control is achieved or you reach 1,200 mcg. The average doseneeded is 800 mcg.\nIn one study using this approach, all twenty-eight of the\npatients in the study were able to avoid having to go to the emer-gency room, with twenty-seven of the twenty-eight patientsroutinely getting signi\ufb01cant relief from pain (decreasing to a mildlevel). The medication was well tolerated with the main sideeffect being nausea in 18 percent of patients. A few patients haditching that was easily relieved by Benadryl. Side effects wereEVALUATING AND TREATING COMMON TYPES OF PAIN\n122", "much less than normally experienced with the usual rescue med-\nication, Demerol.\nPreventing Migraines\nIn addition to being able to treat acute migraines more effectively,many medications can prevent them. T ogether, these medicationsreduce the number of headache days per month by an average of50 percent. These medications include beta-blockers (Inderal),calcium channel blockers, Neurontin, Depakote, T opamax, Elavil,and doxepin. Although Inderal XL can be helpful, it may aggra-vate fatigue, asthma, or depression. Another medication that canbe helpful is Zonegran (an antiseizure medication). Begin with100 mg a day for two weeks and then increase to two tablets a day.The maximum dose is 400 mg daily, although most of the bene-\ufb01t occurs at the \ufb01rst 200 mg. Because there have been rare occur-rences of a life-threatening rash (most rashes caused by themedication are not dangerous, however), stop the medicationimmediately if you get a rash. Do not use this medication if youare allergic to sulfa drugs.\nFortunately, natural remedies are even more effective in pre-\nventing migraines. They may take up to three months to startworking, however, so the above medications can be used whileyou\u2019re waiting for the natural preventives to take effect. Magne-sium by mouth has been found to be effective for migraine pre-vention and is as effective as Elavil. Magnesium serves in anenormous number of functions in the body, including the relax-ation of muscles and arteries. Most Americans get nowhere nearthe optimum amount of magnesium in their diet, getting lessthan 250 mg a day as opposed to the 650 mg that the averageChinese diet supplies. Blood testing to check magnesium levels ishorribly unreliable and may not detect magnesium de\ufb01ciencyuntil it is severe.\nDr. Alexander Mauskop, a leading authority on natural pre-\nvention of migraine headaches and the author of What Your Doc-\ntor May Not Tell You About Migraines , published a study in 1995IT\u2019S NOT ALL IN YOUR HEAD: TREATING HEADACHES AND FACIAL PAIN\n123", "showing that intravenous magnesium could abort a migraine\nheadache. He also found that intravenous magnesium could knockout other types of headaches as well. Such powerful data spurredresearchers to discover that magnesium could also preventmigraines. In one German placebo-controlled study, patients weregiven 600 mg of magnesium or a placebo daily for twelve weeks;there was a signi\ufb01cant drop in migraine frequency in the magne-sium group. Another study shows similar effects in women withmenstrual migraines. Thus, it is a good idea for most migrainepatients to take 150 to 200 mg of magnesium in the morning(present in the vitamin powder) and again with dinner or at bed-time (less if diarrhea is a problem).\nRibo\ufb02avin (vitamin B \u2082) assists in the production of energy. In\none study, migraine patients were given ribo\ufb02avin 400 mg withbreakfast every day for at least three months. By the end of thestudy they had a 67 percent decrease in migraine attacks as wellas a decrease in attack severity. This was later repeated in aplacebo-controlled study. Note that it can take three months forthe ribo\ufb02avin to start working.\nVitamin B \u2081\u2082can also decrease migraine frequency. In one\nstudy in which patients received 1,000 micrograms a day as a nasalspray, migraine frequencies decreased by an average of 43 percentafter three months (the vitamin powder/B-c omplex contains 500\nmicrograms a day).\nFeverfew is another helpful herb for migraine prevention.\nUsing feverfew was found to be very safe and has resulted in a sig-ni\ufb01cant reduction in migraines in one-third of patients.\nButterbur is a shrub that grows in Europe, Asia, and Africa. A\nstandardized extract called Petadolex was used in two double-blind studies. By the third month, those receiving active treatmentwith 100 mg a day had 60 percent fewer migraine attacks than thecontrol group. Although 100 mg a day is effective, 75 mg twice aday with food may be the optimal dose.\nFish oil has also been found to decrease the frequency of\nmigraines. In two placebo-controlled studies of patients with fre-EVALUATING AND TREATING COMMON TYPES OF PAIN\n124", "quent severe migraines that did not respond to medication, \ufb01sh oil\nwas found to be effective. Use one to two tablespoons a day forsix weeks to see the effect. Then you can decrease it to the low-est dose that maintains the bene\ufb01t.\nOther natural compounds that may be helpful include glu-\ncosamine 1,500 to 2,000 mg a day (this compound was found tobe helpful in a small study of ten patients over four to six weeks).Coenzyme Q10, 150 to 200 mg daily, decreased the average num-ber of migraine attacks from 4.8 to 2.8 per month.\nAll this suggests that many, if not most, migraines can be pre-\nvented naturally. I would begin by taking the vitamin powder plus300 mg of vitamin B\n2in the morning, plus 200 mg of magnesium\nat night. If the cost is not prohibitive, I would add butterbur aswell. Also check for food allergies, as noted in the following sec-tion, and follow the advice for hormones in Chapter 2 if themigraines are predominately around your periods or associatedwith taking estrogen. I have seen this approach commonly elim-inate frequent and horribly severe migraine problems, but remem-ber that it may take three months to see the effect.\nEliminating Migraine Triggers\nAcupuncture is another option to consider for chronic migraineand tension headaches. It results in reduced pain, reduced fre-quency of headaches, and improved function, energy, and health.In two studies conducted in New Y ork City and London, acu-puncture was found to be cost-effective. In a randomized con-trolled study of 401 patients with chronic headaches (the majorityhaving migraines), patients received up to twelve acupuncturetreatments over a three-month period versus a control group thatreceived standard care. The acupuncture patients had 22 fewerheadache days per year, 15 percent fewer sick days, and 25 percentfewer visits to the doctor.\nFood allergies are also very important to consider. Approxi-\nmately 30 to 50 percent of migraine patients get marked improve-ment by avoiding certain foods, and most people with migrainesIT\u2019S NOT ALL IN YOUR HEAD: TREATING HEADACHES AND FACIAL PAIN\n125", "are not aware of what foods are triggering their headaches. This\nhas now been demonstrated in at least four placebo-controlledstudies. Food sensitivities are an even bigger problem in childrenwith migraines. T o determine if foods are playing a role in caus-ing your headache, it is helpful to do an elimination diet, whichrequires that you eat a very limited diet for \ufb01ve days. Eat onlypears and lamb, and drink only bottled spring or distilled water.This kind of strict elimination diet will make it easier to tell iffood allergies or sensitivities are present and triggering yourmigraines when you reintroduce foods into your diet. In onestudy, by avoiding the ten most common food triggers, subjectsexhibited a dramatic reduction in the number of headaches permonth, with 85 percent becoming headache-free. T wenty-\ufb01vepercent of the patients with high blood pressure also had theirblood pressure reduce to normal. The most common reactivefoods were wheat in 78 percent of patients, oranges in 65 percent,eggs in 45 percent, tea and coffee in 40 percent each, chocolateand milk in 37 percent each, beef in 35 percent, and corn, canesugar, and yeast in 33 percent each. Some studies also suggest thatthe arti\ufb01cial sweetener aspartame (NutraSweet) can triggermigraines and other headaches, although this is controversial.\nIf you have severe and frequent migraines, it is de\ufb01nitely\nworth exploring f ood sensitivities. Y ou may \ufb01nd that instead of\navoiding foods that trigger your migraines for the rest of your life,you can eliminate the sensitivities/allergies by using a powerfullyeffective acupressure technique called NAET (see NAET.com).\nReducing Estrogen-Induced Migraines\nIn many women, migraines are triggered by a sudden drop inestrogen level. Because of this, migraines are often worse on thetwo days before or after the day the period starts. For those tak-ing estrogen replacement or the birth control pill, the headachesmay occur in the hours before the next dose of therapy is due (asthe estrogen level is dropping). In these situations, the key is toprevent the dropping estrogen level. One way to do this is to useEVALUATING AND TREATING COMMON TYPES OF PAIN\n126", "an estrogen patch for one week beginning a few days before your\nperiod is expected (for example a Climara .025 patch). For thosetaking the pill, switch to a different form of birth control if youget the headaches throughout your cycle. If you only get the head-ache for the week that you stop the pill, consider taking the pillevery day and stopping it only one week every \ufb01ve months. Forthat week, use the estrogen patch noted above. Anti-in\ufb02ammatoryaspirin-family medications like Motrin and Aleve may be helpfulin combination with Imitrex-related medications in estrogen-associated headaches.\nOther Common Severe Headaches\nA surprising number of people with chronic headaches haveunderlying medical problems that are often treatable\u2014and thatshould be treated before the problem escalates any further.\nSinus Headaches\nSinusitis is a common cause of headaches. It is usually associated\nwith pain and tenderness over the sinuses by the cheeks or abovethe eyes. Nasal congestion, often with yellow-green nasal mucus,is also common. Interestingly, I have found that most cases ofchronic sinusitis are associated with yeast overgrowth. These fun-gal infections (similar to vaginal yeast infections but occurringpredominantly in the bowels) cause an allergic-type reactionresulting in swelling of the nasal passages. This swelling blocks thesinuses, resulting in a secondary bacterial infection (when themucous turns yellow-green), which is very painful. Y ou then getantibiotics from your doctor that knock out the bacterial infec-tion but worsen the yeast/fungal infection and the nasal conges-tion. Things then get blocked up again and reinfected, and youare off to the doctor for another antibiotic (and more yeast prob-lems). This is why sinusitis usually becomes chronic.\nI have found that when you treat the yeast overgrowth by tak-\ning Di\ufb02ucan for six weeks and avoiding sugar (as discussed previ-IT\u2019S NOT ALL IN YOUR HEAD: TREATING HEADACHES AND FACIAL PAIN\n127", "ously in Chapter 3 in the section on infections), most chronic\nsinusitis will go away. Adding a colloidal silver nose spray (listedin Appendix B) is also worthwhile. It is also helpful to use a spe-cial prescription nose spray that contains antibacterials and anti-fungals. Y our doctor can order it by calling Cape Apothecary at410-757-3522 and asking for the \u201csinusitis nose spray.\u201d\nUse one to two sprays in each nostril twice a day. If it is irri-\ntating, then it is too concentrated for you, and you can simply adda small amount of salt water. Patients \ufb01nd this to be enormouslyhelpful. If fungal overgrowth is causing your chronic sinusitis, itmay also be causing spastic colon, which also often resolves whenyou treat the yeast. Unfortunately, many doctors still consider thepossibility of yeast overgrowth to be nonsense\u2014just as occurredin medicine when we \ufb01rst began to understand about bacterialinfections. Because of this, you may have to go to a holistic/com-plementary physician to get the treatment you need. (Resourcesfor \ufb01nding a holistic physician are listed in Appendix B.)\nCaffeine Withdrawal Headaches\nAlthough caffeine can sometimes decrease headache pain (and canbe found combined with aspirin in some headache products), toomuch caffeine can become problematic. Common in people whodrink too much coffee, caffeine withdrawal headaches are espe-cially frequent in the morning before people get their coffee \u201c\ufb01x\u201dand may occur approximately eighteen hours after their last cupof coffee. They often begin with a feeling of fullness in one\u2019s headand may be aggravated by exercise. Slowly decreasing your caf-feine intake by about one cup daily each week, and perhaps mix-ing decaf with regular coffee as part of your weaning process, canhelp. Other people prefer to simply go cold turkey, tough out theheadache, and be done with it.\nCluster Headaches\nThese headaches occur as a repeating series of headaches that caneach last thirty to ninety minutes and are very severe. They causeEVALUATING AND TREATING COMMON TYPES OF PAIN\n128", "excruciating, piercing pain on one side of the head (often centered\naround one eye) and are much more common in men. Many med-ications can help, including antiseizure medications like Depakote(valproic acid) 500 to 1,000 mg a day or T opamax 50 to 100 mga day. These often start to work in one to two weeks. Lithium300 mg three times a day can also prevent cluster headaches.High-dose lithium must be monitored with blood level testsbecause it can cause an underactive thyroid, tremors, and othertoxicity. The tremors and neurologic toxicity can be decreased bytaking a few teaspoons of expeller-pressed saf\ufb02ower oil each day(from your local health food store).\nTrigeminal Neuralgia\nTrigeminal neuralgia affects a large cranial nerve and is charac-terized by excruciating attacks of stabbing, shooting pain in thelips, gums, cheek, or chin that last for a few seconds to minutes.It occurs almost exclusively in the middle-aged and elderly.Trigeminal neuralgia often responds well to treatment with themedications T egretol and/or Neurontin.\nOther Headaches\nIn some headaches, there may actually be increased pressure in thebrain. Some practitioners have found that using Diamox (a diuretic)125 to 500 mg once or twice daily decreases these headaches. Car-bonated beverages will taste funny while you\u2019re on this medication.\nJaw Joint Dysfunction (TMJ/TMD)\nT emporomandibular joint dysfunction (TMJ/TMD) is a commoncause of facial pain and headaches. Although classically consideredto come from the jaw joint (the area just in front of your ears), inmany cases the pain is actually coming from tightness of the mas-seter muscles, which can pull the jaw out of alignment. The mas-seter is the very powerful muscle we use to chew our food, andI\u2019ve been told it can generate 1,000 pounds of pressure per squareinch. TMJ can occur when this muscle goes into spasm/shorten-IT\u2019S NOT ALL IN YOUR HEAD: TREATING HEADACHES AND FACIAL PAIN\n129", "ing. This can be caused by a poor bite, but also by all the other\nfactors we discuss in Chapters 2 and 3 and under \ufb01bromyalgia andmyofascial pain in Chapter 6. By treating these same issues (sleep,hormonal de\ufb01ciencies, infections, and nutritional support) themasseter muscles often release and the pain goes away. Because ofthis, dentists often come to my pain workshops and use thesetreatments.\nA simple way to tell if the masseter muscle is contributing to\nyour pain is to put your thumb into your mouth and put itbetween your molars (back teeth) while also placing your secondand third \ufb01ngers about two inches in front of your earlobe. Y ouwill feel a muscle between your thumb and \ufb01ngers. Squeeze themuscle between your thumb and \ufb01ngers and see if it producesmuch pain/tenderness. If so, your TMJ pain may be coming fromthe muscle and not the joint.\nZana\ufb02ex, like other treatments for muscle pain, can be very\nhelpful. In one study, 2 mg of Zana\ufb02ex was taken two times a dayfor two weeks by seventy-eight people with jaw muscle pain. Bythe end of the treatment period, all of the patients had improved;forty-two patients (53.8 percent) showed absence of clinicalsymptoms; eighteen (23.1 percent) showed a good improvementwhile still presenting a low number of painful sites; and eighteen(23.1 percent) showed only a slight improvement.\nIt is also important to be aware that pain and hot/cold sensi-\ntivity in your teeth can come from tight muscles in the face\u2014despite your teeth being totally healthy. It is frightening to seehow many people have had unnecessary root canals because theirdoctor/dentist is not familiar with these pain referral patterns. Fortooth pain in the lower jaw, push on the muscles right below thoseteeth to see if they are tender. Pain in the upper teeth can bereferred from the masseter muscles ( just in front of the ears) orthe pterygoid muscles (a large area by the temples). If these aretender and you do not have obvious tooth problems on yourx-ray/exam, try the pain creams and/or Lidoderm patches and agentle massage over those tender muscles three times a day for aEVALUATING AND TREATING COMMON TYPES OF PAIN\n130", "few weeks to see if you can eliminate the dental pain. These den-\ntal pain referral patterns are described at length (along with treat-ment) in The Trigger Point Manual by Dr. Janet Travell and Dr.\nDavid Simons, which is the best pain book for doctors ever writ-ten. Treating these muscles \ufb01rst is a lot more fun than having rootcanals or having your teeth pulled unnecessarily!\nIn some cases of jaw joint pain, the discomfort is coming from\nthe jaw joint itself. Often, the bite is not in alignment, and thisaggravates the pain. Treating the bite can help. In addition, it ishelpful to be sure that you do not grind your teeth at night (brux-ism) and to have your dentist give you a mouth guard if you do.Often the x-ray will show arthritis or cartilage slipping or loss inthe jaw joint. Some dentists recommend surgery in these situa-tions. I usually recommend that other measures be tried \ufb01rst.IT\u2019S NOT ALL IN YOUR HEAD: TREATING HEADACHES AND FACIAL PAIN\n131", "This page intentionally left blank ", "A Pain in the Gut\nIndigestion, ulcers, acid re\ufb02ux, gastritis, and spastic colon are\ncommon causes of abdominal and chest pains (discussed in Chap-ter 10).

This is interesting as stomach acid production decreasesdramatically as people get older. However, we seem to forget thathaving stomach acid is both necessary and normal. In fact, thebody has gone to great lengths to be able to produce stomach acidwithout digesting the stomach itself! Y our body needs to haveproper nutrition to make the mucous lining that protects thestomach. Instead of giving our body what it needs to heal, wesometimes make the mistake of turning off our stomach acid tosolve the problem.\nMost indigestion symptoms occur when stomach acid re\ufb02uxes\n(squirts) back up into the food pipe (the esophagus). Y our foodpipe is not made to resist stomach acid, and even a little bit willcause it to burn. Because of this, we take medications that turnoff all the stomach acid. Because there is no stomach acid, theburning stops, and we get deluded into thinking the problem istoo much stomach acid.\nUnfortunately, using antacid medications for an extended\nperiod causes two problems. First, with no stomach acid yourbody is not able to optimally digest food and you become nutri-tionally de\ufb01cient. This makes it even harder for your stomach tomake the mucous lining it needs to protect itself and can set youup for even more re\ufb02ux. Second, in your body\u2019s attempt to makethe stomach acid it desperately needs (when you take antacidmedications), it makes huge amounts of a hormone called gastrin,which stimulates stomach acid.

Because they helpto heal the stomach instead of just masking symptoms, theymay take three to six weeks to work in severe cases. Y ou canuse your antacids during that time if you want.\n\u2022Add Limonene (Heartburn Free by Enzymatic\nTherapy) once your indigestion has settled down a bitwith the licorice and mastic gum. In many patients,A PAIN IN THE GUT\n135", "stomach infections ( H. pylori ) can be a major cause of long-\nterm indigestion. Most doctors treat this with Priloseccombined with two to three antibiotics used simultaneously.However, while the suggested natural remedies may initiallyaggravate re\ufb02ux symptoms, by killing the infection they maygive long-term relief after only one ten-capsule course! Takeone capsule of Heartburn Free every other day for twentydays. Mastic gum can also eliminate H. pylori infections.\nComing off Prescription Antacids Safely\nAfter you have been on this treatment regimen for one to two\nmonths and are feeling much better, ask your doctor if you canstop your prescription antacids and switch to Tagamet (or stay onthe DGL licorice/mastic gum). This will decrease your stomachacid instead of totally turning it off. By doing this, your body canslowly ease back to a normal production of acid. Decrease thedose of Tagamet or DGL licorice until you are able to come offof it. After two months, most people can stop the licorice/masticgum. They can be used as long as you want, however. If symp-toms recur down the line, simply use the mastic gum or DGLlicorice for a few days. If needed, you can repeat the course ofDGL licorice/mastic gum (and even the Heartburn Free if thestomach infection recurs) whenever you like. Meanwhile, you\u2019llhave broken your addiction to antacids and allowed your body tohave the stomach acid it needs for proper digestion!\nThe Importance of Enzymes for Digestive Health\nUnfortunately, medical schools do not give physicians much infor-mation on proper nutrition or digestive health. Y et how can yourbody stay healthy if it can\u2019t get the nutrition that it needs from food?Enzyme de\ufb01ciencies can contribute to many conditions, including:\n\u2022Indigestion, gas, bloating, diarrhea, and constipation\n\u2022Arthritis and in\ufb02ammatory disorders\n\u2022Fatigue and muscle achesEVALUATING AND TREATING COMMON TYPES OF PAIN\n136", "Proper nutrition is important for all your body\u2019s functions. The\nability to properly digest your food is critical for proper nutritionand the avoidance of toxicity.\nIn medical school, I was taught that the pancreas and salivary\nglands made all of the enzymes you needed to digest your food. Ifthere was a problem with the pancreas, we could always givedigestive enzyme tablets made from an animal pancreas to take careof the problem. This information seems to be woefully de\ufb01cient!\nWhat goes on in real life is that most of the enzymes we need\nto digest the foods we eat are naturally present in the foods. Thisoccurs because fruits and vegetables use enzymes to ripen. As theripening process continues, the food breaks down to where weconsider it to be rotten. From the perspective of an apple or grain,however, this is a perfect stage for the seed to use its food sourceso it can grow into an adult plant. These same plant enzymes workin the acid environment of your stomach, where approximately40 percent of digestion can take place, while animal enzymes can\u2019twork until after they get past the stomach.\nDecades ago, food processors realized that they could prolong\nthe shelf life of food from days to years by destroying the enzymespresent in the food. They also discovered that heat or salicylates (theactive component of aspirin) are very effective ways to destroyenzymes. Over the last thirty years, the processing of foods hasessentially eliminated most of the enzymes present in our food.This corresponds to the period of time in which we have seen adramatic increase in degenerative diseases and indigestion. Mean-while, your poor pancreas has had to pick up the slack and makealmost all the enzymes needed for digestion. Many people realized,however, that if they juiced or ate a raw food diet (cooking can alsodestroy enzymes) they felt dramatically better. Food processors arelearning new tricks, though. By gassing fresh fruits and vegetables,they can destroy the enzymes present even in these fresh foods.This way these foods can look appealing on the grocery shelf forweeks instead of developing those little brown spots that we don\u2019tlike to see. Unfortunately, although the food looks good when youdestroy the enzymes, it has lost much of its nutritional value.A PAIN IN THE GUT\n137", "What Happens When You Don\u2019t Have Enough Enzymes\nWhen you don\u2019t have enough enzymes to adequately digest your\nfood, several things happen. First, you become de\ufb01cient in pro-teins, carbohydrates, and/or fats\u2014depending on which enzymesyou are missing\u2014and you then crave the missing nutrient. By eat-ing excessive amounts of the nutrient you can\u2019t digest, it can buildup in your colon and become toxic. Y ou absorb large chunks ofproteins into your bloodstream before they are broken down totheir component amino acids, and then your immune system hasto treat them as outside invaders, using up its energy completingthe digestion of those foods. This process can exhaust yourimmune system while contributing to food sensitivities. (If youcheck you may \ufb01nd that your temperature goes up around fortyminutes after eating because your immune system has had to makeup for a weak digestive system.)\nThus, your body works poorly because of the nutritional de\ufb01-\nciencies, and you have digestive disturbances. All in all, you feellousy. Y our stomach hurts, and you may have speci\ufb01c food crav-ings. Sound familiar?\nWhy Which Enzymes You Use Matters\nAs noted earlier, it is critical that the enzymes be from plant sources,as animal enzymes do not work in the acid environment of thestomach. Enzymes can also easily be destroyed in processing, soquality is critical. I recommend taking Similase or Complet eGest,\ntwo with each meal. If the enzymes irritate your stomach in thebeginning, as protein-digesting enzymes might, begin with GSSimilase \ufb01rst because this form is gentler on the stomach.\nEliminating Spastic Colon by Treating the\nUnderlying Causes\nAnother painful abdominal problem is spastic colon (also known\nas irritable bowel syndrome), which can occur when you have gas,bloating, abdominal cramps, diarrhea, and/or constipation with anegative medical workup. When physicians do not know what isEVALUATING AND TREATING COMMON TYPES OF PAIN\n138", "causing your symptoms, we give you the label of \u201cspastic colon,\u201d\ninstead of more effectively searching for the source of thesymptoms.\nThe most effective way to eliminate spastic colon is to treat the\nunderlying cause. This is usually infection, and in my experiencemost patients\u2019 spastic colon resolves when the underlying bowelinfections are treated. What is most important is to treat the can-dida/fungal overgrowth in the gut. Unfortunately, most physi-cians still make believe that fungal or yeast overgrowth isnonexistent. This is reminiscent of our early days in medicinewhen we \ufb01rst learned about, but still ridiculed, the possibility ofbacterial infections. Although the research needs to be c ompleted\nto demonstrate the role of fungal infections in chronic illness, alarge body of clinical experience has shown this to be a majorproblem. Many people with yeast overgrowth also \ufb01nd that theyhave chronic sinusitis and/or nasal congestion that go away whenthe fungal infection is treated.\nIn addition, many patients have parasitic infections. For exam-\nple, in my study on the effective treatment of chronic fatigue syn-drome, one out of six of the study patients had a parasite present.Unfortunately, many if not most labs are clueless about how to con-duct a proper stool parasite exam and will miss the vast majority ofthese infections. Because of this, I would only do the parasitologytesting by mail at the Great Smokies Diagnostic Laboratory or theParasitology Center (see Appendix B). If your doctor will not giveyou a lab requisition for this test at these labs, or for any other testsyou may need, you can obtain a lab requisition on my website at nocharge (vitality101.com\u2014click on \u201cDo the Program\u201d and then on\u201cGet a lab requisition\u201d).\nI would also recommend a stool test for Clostridium dif\ufb01cile\ntoxin. Clostridium dif\ufb01cile is a toxin-producing bacteria, and this\ntest can be done at any laboratory. For more information on treat-ing these infections, see Chapter 3 in this book and my book From\nFatigued to Fantastic!\nWhile you\u2019re going after the underlying cause of a spastic\ncolon, there are many treatments you can take for symptomaticA PAIN IN THE GUT\n139", "relief. One natural therapy is peppermint oil. This must be in an\nenteric-coated capsule or it could be quite irritating. Take one totwo capsules three times a day between meals ( notwith food) for\nspastic colon. I recommend Peppermint Plus or Mentharil. Othernatural remedies that can be helpful are Iberogast (digestive sys-tem herbal), twenty drops three times a day in warm water withmeals (takes four to eight weeks to work), or artichoke extract,two 160 mg capsules three times a day. Artichoke extract stimu-lates bile acid release and may help decrease the risk of gallstones.Over-the-counter simethicone (Mylicon) can also be helpful.When chewed, this breaks big gas bubbles into little ones,decreasing the sense of bloating.\nPrescription medications that can be helpful include antispas-\nmodics such as hyoscyamine and Valium family medications suchas Librax. These can be used on an as-needed basis. If constipa-tion is a predominant symptom, adding \ufb01ber and water plus theEnergy Revitalization System vitamin powder can be very help-ful. If these are not adequate, you can take the prescription med-ication MiraLax. In addition, you can add Zelnorm 6 mg twice aday for both constipation and pain.EVALUATING AND TREATING COMMON TYPES OF PAIN\n140", "Dealing with Pelvic Pain\nSyndromes\nPelvic pain can be caused by menstrual cramps, vulvodynia, inter-\nstitial cystitis, endometriosis, or prostadynia. In this chapter, we\u2019llreview each of these.\nInterstitial Cystitis (IC)\nInterstitial cystitis is a bladder problem that causes severe discom-fort in approximately \ufb01ve hundred thousand Americans. Ninetypercent of people affected are women, and the condition oftenoccurs in association with other illnesses such as \ufb01bromyalgia.Onset of symptoms is often between the ages of forty and sixty.On average, people see \ufb01ve doctors before they \ufb01nd one who isable to make the diagnosis. IC is characterized by severe urinaryurgency, frequency, burning, and pain. These symptoms in mildform are common in chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS), \ufb01bromyal-gia, and chronic pain, and are not what I am discussing here. ICis when these symptoms are the predominant problem and areoften so severe that people want to have their bladder removed.\nThe more common category of IC is nonulcerative and is most\noften seen in young to middle-aged women. It is associated withnormal or increased bladder capacity. The cause of IC is notCHAPTER9\n141\nCopyright \u00a9 200 6 by Jacob  Teitelbaum . Click here for terms of use.  ", "known, but there are many theories. In all likelihood, it is caused\nby a number of different problems. One possibility is that thereare infectious triggers, which either irritate the bladder directlyor cause an autoimmune reaction in which the body attacks itself.The autoimmune theory has recently been getting more support.For whatever reason, the protective inner lining of the bladder(called the glycosaminoglycan, or GAG) gets damaged, resultingin severe bladder irritation and pain, urinary urgency and fre-quency, and decreased bladder capacity. Again, it is important topoint out that the symptoms in mild form are very common andare not IC. IC is often associated with vulvar pain and painfulintercourse (discussed later in this chapter). There is no de\ufb01nitivetest for IC, and the diagnosis is based on clinical symptoms andbladder cystoscopy (looking in the bladder with a tube). Otherinfections need to be ruled out, as does cancer.\nHow to Relieve Symptoms with Medications\nAlthough there is currently no cure for interstitial cystitis, thereis much that can be done to relieve the symptoms. Surgery shouldbe a very rare and \ufb01nal resort. Even after the bladder has beenremoved, half of the IC patients will continue to suffer from pain.\nOnce bacterial infections have been ruled out, I add Elavil\n25 mg at bedtime plus Neurontin. If these are ineffective, a trialof Sinequan and the other antiseizure medications are worth-while. The medications Pyridium, which numbs the bladder andturns the urine and sweat light orange, and Urispas, an antispas-modic, can be helpful as well.\nI would also treat the patient for presumptive candida with oral\nDi\ufb02ucan for three months, which may help as well. (See the anti-fungal/antiyeast protocol discussed in Chapter 3.) Although it hasnot been well studied, many physicians suspect that yeast over-growth, like some other infections, may contribute to IC. A crit-ical part of the antiyeast/antifungal protocol is avoiding sugar,which feeds yeast. Interestingly, Dr. Ward Dean had noted thatone person\u2019s IC cleared up when she used xylitol, which looks andEVALUATING AND TREATING COMMON TYPES OF PAIN\n142", "tastes like sugar, as a sugar substitute. It is not clear whether the\nxylitol helped, or simply avoiding the sugar was the reason for thepatient\u2019s relief. Either way, xylitol is a good sugar substitute withmultiple health bene\ufb01ts, including preventing cavities and osteo-porosis, and is worth trying.\nUrologists can also put different medications in the bladder,\nsuch as DMSO and heparin, both of which can be helpful. I rec-ommend the medication Elmiron, which may take three monthsto work. Take a 100 mg capsule three times a day with water atleast one hour before, or two hours after, eating.\nNatural Ways to Relieve Symptoms\nIt is also important to avoid certain foods that may aggravatesymptoms and to recognize that vitamins, especially the B vita-mins and any that are acidic, can dramatically irritate the bladderin some patients with IC. Because of this, supplements, especiallyone as powerful as the Energy Revitalization System vitaminpowder, should be tried in extraordinarily tiny doses (stick a \ufb01n-ger in the powder and lick it) \ufb01rst to make sure they are tolerated.Then slowly increase the dose if you are able. Take any B vitaminswith a large amount of water. Otherwise, they can achieve highconcentrations in the bladder. In most people this causes no prob-lem, but can be irritating in those with IC or bladder spasm. Bvitamins are bright yellow and you can tell when they are con-centrated in the urine.\nDr. Stanley Jacob, M.D., the physician who helped to get FDA\napproval for the use of DMSO (instilled into the bladder) for IC,has also explored the use of methylsulfonylmethane (MSM) totreat IC patients. Although MSM takes longer to work (severalmonths), it is better tolerated than the DMSO, which is irritatingand results in a garlicky body smell. Dr. Jacob estimates that 80percent of his IC patients improve with MSM. He has his patientsmake a formula of 15 percent MSM in deionized sterile water anduse a catheter to put the solution in their bladders (two to \ufb01vetimes a week), holding it in their bladder as long as is comfortable.DEALING WITH PELVIC PAIN SYNDROMES\n143", "He gives the MSM intravenously and by mouth (starting with 1 g\na day and increasing to 18 g daily). For more information, see Dr.Jacob\u2019s book MSM\u2014the De\ufb01nitive Guide .\nLower morning cortisol levels have also been associated with\nincreased symptoms of IC. Many \ufb01bromyalgia patients getmarked improvement in their IC as part of the overall improve-ment of their \ufb01bromyalgia. One of the treatments I often give iscortisol in very low doses.\nAnother natural remedy that has been shown to be helpful in\nIC is the amino acid L-arginine 500 mg three times a day for threemonths. In one study of \ufb01fty-three patients with IC, half weregiven the L-arginine and the other half a placebo. At the end ofthree months, 29 percent of the patients on arginine were feelingbetter with less pain and urgency as compared to 8 percent in theplacebo group. L-arginine helps to make nitric oxide, which canrelax the bladder muscle. The enzyme that makes nitric oxide hasbeen shown to be low in interstitial cystitis patients. In anotheropen study using 1,500 mg of L-arginine daily a similar effect wasseen. Another study using higher amounts did not show bene\ufb01t,so more is not better.\nSome health practitioners have found that patients with inter-\nstitial cystitis often have chronic extremely alkaline urine. Thiscan be aggravated by excessive coffee and cola intake. PH strippaper can be obtained cheaply at most pharmacies, and one cantest multiple urine samples at home to see if the pH is regularlyover 7.0.\nIn addition, certain enzyme therapies by Thera-zyme have\nbeen found to be very helpful. They can be obtained from myof\ufb01ce at 410-573-5389 or from the Thera-zyme company. Forinterstitial cystitis use the enzyme URT. Take four capsules \ufb01vetimes a day between meals; and add the enzyme product calledKDY , two capsules every twenty minutes, as needed during \ufb02ares.In two to four weeks the symptoms may subside and the productscan then be taken just as needed.\nAlthough I have not yet used it for interstitial cystitis, it would\nbe worth trying the herbal saw palmetto, 160 mg twice a day forEVALUATING AND TREATING COMMON TYPES OF PAIN\n144", "six weeks as this relaxes the bladder muscle in those with urinary\nretention and an enlarged prostate. Research shows that this safeherb promotes smooth muscle (the bladder muscle) cell relaxationby a number of different mechanisms. It takes six weeks to work.\nThe good news is that most patients I have seen with IC have\nreceived signi\ufb01cant relief using some combination of thesetreatments.\nPainful Menstrual Cramps and Vulvodynia\nFor menstrual pain, NSAIDs can be very helpful. Y ou can beginwith over-the-counter pain relievers such as Advil or Aleve.\nVulvodynia is de\ufb01ned as chronic vulvar itching, burning, and/\nor pain that is signi\ufb01cantly uncomfortable. In this condition, vul-var/vaginal pain can either occur only during intercourse or beconstantly present. It used to be thought that it was fairly rare.Recently, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) funded a studyto see how common vulvodynia is. According to Dr. Harlow,associate professor of gynecology at Harvard Medical School,\u201cThe preliminary data suggest that possibly millions of womenmay be affected at some point during their lifetime.\u201d The Inter-national Society for the Study of Vulvovaginal Disease has pro-posed several names to describe the different types of vulvodyniawhich include:\n\u2022Generalized vulvar dysesthesia (VDY)\u2014characterized by\npain that can occur anywhere on the vulva\n\u2022Localized vulvar dysesthesia\u2014characterized by pain that can\nbe consistently localized by pushing on certain area(s) of thevulva\n\u2022Mixed dysesthesia\u2014a combination of both of the above\nSymptoms can occur anywhere from the pubic bone to the\nanus. It may be present all of the time, sporadically, or only withintercourse. Many women feel like they have a chronic yeastinfection. In others, it feels raw, swollen, or like they are sittingDEALING WITH PELVIC PAIN SYNDROMES\n145", "on a hard knot. Burning, electric shocks, and tingling are also\noften felt. If the area around the urethra (where the urine comesout) is involved, the woman may feel like she has a chronic blad-der infection. She may have recurrent urinary urgency, frequency,and burning despite having negative urine cultures. Painful inter-course (dyspareunia) is common, and pain may even occur fromtight slacks or panties.\nSome patients have found that for painful intercourse, topical\n0.2 percent nitroglycerine cream can give temporary relief (madeby a compounding pharmacist in a base without any irritatingadditives). In my experience, vulvodynia seems to occur as threemain types: neuropathic, in\ufb02ammatory, or as muscle pain.\nWhen It\u2019s Neuropathic\nNeuropathic vulvodynia appears to be caused by nerve irritationand is sharp, burning, and/or shooting (like nerve pain). In thiscase, apply the treatment principles in Chapter 4 on neuropathicpain. Begin with tricyclic antidepressants (nortriptyline, desipra-mine, imipramine, doxepin, or Elavil) at 25 to 150 mg each nightand/or Neurontin (100 mg to 3,600 mg daily), and proceed fromthere. Be sure to use a high enough dose of the medications andgive them enough time to work, which may take three months.In addition, topical lidocaine (Novocain) gel can be helpful (forexample, EMLA cream). In severe cases, opiates may be necessary.\nWhen It\u2019s In\ufb02ammatory\nWhen vulvodynia pain is associated with local in\ufb02ammation/irri-tation, I would avoid topical creams, especially if they containparabens, propylene glycol, fragrance, or sorbic acid. Also, do notuse topical antifungals or over-the-counter creams. Instead, I rou-tinely give at least a three-month trial of oral Di\ufb02ucan 200 mg aday to be sure any chronic vaginal yeast is eliminated. Occasion-ally, long-term Di\ufb02ucan treatment is needed. In this case, checkliver blood tests occasionall, because this medicine can cause liverin\ufb02ammation. Some patients \ufb01nd that avoiding oxalates can helpdecrease symptoms. In a small subset of patients, one can see aEVALUATING AND TREATING COMMON TYPES OF PAIN\n146", "narrow ring of tissue that is in\ufb02amed and which reproduces the\npain when touched (with a cotton swab). In these patients, surgi-cally removing that small area of tissue is reasonable.\nWhen It\u2019s Muscle Pain\nIf the pain is deep-seated and not triggered by touching the outervagina, it may be coming from spasm of the deep pelvic muscles.In this situation, the pain may occur or be accentuated during thedeep thrusting of intercourse. For this pain, the general principlesfor treating muscle pain apply (see Chapter 6). In addition, EMGbiofeedback of the pelvic \ufb02oor muscles may help vulvodyniacaused by muscle pain. Muscles that are often involved include theobturator internus and pubococcygeus. The sacroiliac joint anddisc/spine disease (see \u201cTreating Disc Disease\u201d in Chapter 10) alsorefer pain to the pelvic and rectal areas. Any injury or conditionaffecting these can trigger pelvic pain.\nImportant Precautions to Take with Vulvodynia\nAs noted earlier, precautions include avoiding any direct chemi-cal contacts that can irritate the vulva such as sprays, creams, orminipads. In addition, it is a good idea to wear loose, comfortableclothes and to avoid thong underwear and biking. Sitz baths canalso be helpful. Menopausal women should use topical naturalestrogen (estradiol) to prevent atrophy.\nMany of my patients with \ufb01bromyalgia also have vulvodynia.\nAs with IC, it seems that symptoms of vulvodynia often resolveas their \ufb01bromyalgia resolves. I put almost all women with pelvicpain on tricyclics such as Elavil or nortriptyline combined withNeurontin.\nEndometriosis\nEndometriosis is a complex disorder affecting females during their\nreproductive years. In this disorder, the tissue that lines the insideof the uterus and sheds each month during the menstrual cycle(called the endometrium) escapes the uterus and attaches to inap-DEALING WITH PELVIC PAIN SYNDROMES\n147", "propriate areas within the pelvis and abdomen. These growths\nthen respond to changes in estrogen just like tissue within theuterus. Because of this, women will often get pelvic and abdomi-nal pains that are worse around their period. These pains are usu-ally worse than menstrual cramps. In addition to pain, womenwith endometriosis often experience myriad other symptoms sim-ilar to \ufb01bromyalgia (fatigue, insomnia, widespread achiness) thatimprove with treatment (see Chapter 6) as well as allergies, asthma,and autoimmune problems. Although the cause of endometriosisis unknown, there are many theories.\nMost doctors forget to consider this diagnosis in evaluating\nabdominal and pelvic pain. The diagnosis is made by laparoscopy.During this surgical procedure, the surgeon makes a small inci-sion and inserts a tube through which he can see the internalorgans to evaluate for endometrial implants. If these implants areseen, the diagnosis is made and treatment is given with hormonaltherapies that attempt to stop ovulation. Pain medications aregiven as well. Pregnancy often causes a temporary remission ofsymptoms. Many alternative therapies are also available.\nAlthough this condition is too complex to be dealt with thor-\noughly in this book, I recommend a book called Endometriosis by\nMary Lou Ballweg and the Endometriosis Association. This orga-nization is located in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, and is dedicated tohelping women with endometriosis.\nProstatitis and Prostadynia\nEven in the absence of a full-blown attack of prostatitis, which isusually not subtle and is easily diagnosed and treated, prostate painis fairly common in men. When no infection is found, it is calledprostadynia . It is also known as chronic nonbacterial prostatitis or\nchronic pelvic pain syndrome (CPPS). Unfortunately, when doctors\ndo not know what is causing a problem, we often presume it mustbe psychological (\u201cI don\u2019t know what\u2019s wrong with you, so youmust be crazy!\u201d). This is what has occurred with prostadynia.EVALUATING AND TREATING COMMON TYPES OF PAIN\n148", "I suspect that prostadynia often occurs because of subtle infec-\ntions that do not grow on our culture media. These commonlyinclude fungal infections and/or other slow-growing antibiotic-sensitive infections. In the latter case, the prostate is mildly boggy(indents like a ripe fruit) instead of \ufb01rm and is tender on exami-nation. Unfortunately, most doctors consider such an exam nor-mal despite your having prostate symptoms. These symptomsinclude urinary urgency without there necessarily being muchurine present and burning on urination. The discomfort is oftenfelt on the tip of the penis. Because the infection is not overt,most doctors offer no treatment.\nMy suspicion is that this is indeed an infectious problem in\nmany cases. This suspicion is bolstered by a recent study showingthat mepartricin (40 mg per day for two months), an antibioticwith antifungal and antiparasitic properties, decreased symptomsby 60 percent in these patients. The study does not totally supportinfection as the cause, however, because the medication also low-ers estrogen levels in the prostate and can work in that way as well.In the study, the authors theorized that lowering estrogen causedthe improvement. My experience, however, shows that patientsalso improve with antibiotics and antifungals that do not lowerestrogen. Treatment needs to be given for many months, sinceanti-infectious agents have dif\ufb01culty getting into the prostate.\nThe bio\ufb02avonoid vitamin quercetin (500 mg twice a day) also\ndecreases prostate symptoms in both prostadynia and prostatitis.In one study, thirty men with severe prostadynia lasting an aver-age of eleven years were treated with either quercetin 500 mgtwice a day or a placebo for one month. There was an average 37percent decrease in symptoms with over two-thirds of patientsfeeling they gained a meaningful bene\ufb01t. Quercetin 500 mg ispresent in the Energy Revitalization System vitamin powder (seeAppendix B).DEALING WITH PELVIC PAIN SYNDROMES\n149", "This page intentionally left blank ", "Treating Other\nCommon Pains \nBased on \nTheir Locations\nIn this chapter, I focus on other common pains that are based on\na speci\ufb01c location in the body. I cover treatments for back pain,one of the most common chronic pain conditions, as well as fornoncardiac chest pain, which is also fairly common and present inabout 10 percent of the population. Pain in the arms and legs isalso discussed in this chapter, including carpal tunnel syndrome,tendonitis, frozen shoulder, leg cramps, plantar fasciitis, and Mor-ton\u2019s neuroma.\nChronic Back Pain\nChronic back pain affects an estimated 36 million Americans. Itis the price we pay for being an upright species. Fortunately, it isalso very treatable. In understanding back pain, it is helpful tounderstand the anatomy of the spine. The spine is made up of a\n151CHAPTER10\nCopyright \u00a9 200 6 by Jacob  Teitelbaum . Click here for terms of use.  ", "column of bones called the vertebrae. From top to bottom, these\nare divided into four sections:\n\u2022The seven cervical (neck) vertebrae (C1\u2013C7)\n\u2022The twelve thoracic (upper back) vertebrae (T1\u2013T12)\n\u2022The \ufb01ve lumbar (lower back) vertebrae (L1\u2013L5)\n\u2022The sacrum plus the tailbone (coccyx) at the bottom of the\nspine\nThe bones/vertebrae of the spinal column are held together by\ntendons, ligaments, and muscles. Between the vertebrae are shockabsorbers called discs. These \ufb02exible pads of cartilage contain liq-uid. If this liquid leaks out, it can trigger in\ufb02ammation andswelling, which pinches on the nerve roots, causing pain. Byeliminating the tissue swelling using intravenous colchicine (dis-cussed later), disc pain can be eliminated approximately 70 per-cent of the time without surgery!\nThe spinal cord itself is a critical bundle of nerve cells that are\ninside the spinal column and protected by it. At each of the ver-tebrae, nerve roots come out of the front of the spinal columncarrying information from the brain to the body and nerve rootsenter the back of the spinal column bringing information fromthe body to the brain. Compression of, or dam age to, these nerve\nroots causes pain and loss of sensation and function.\nIt\u2019s always good to start with the basics when considering treat-\nment for back pain. For example, in one study people with lowback pain who slept on a medium \ufb01rm mattress had less back painthan those who slept on a \ufb01rm mattress. Distraction and relax-ation, such as listening to relaxing music for one half-hour dailyfor three weeks, also reduced back pain by 40 percent.\nTreating Disc Disease\nIn disc disease, the nerve is being pinched as it comes out of thespine. As the vertebrae and discs (the building blocks that makeup the spine) develop wear and tear, the discs, which act as shockEVALUATING AND TREATING COMMON TYPES OF PAIN\n152", "absorbers between the vertebrae, sometimes rupture, and the \ufb02uid\ninside of the disc leaks out. As noted earlier, this disc \ufb02uid cancause in\ufb02ammation and swelling that can compress the nerve as itenters the spine, causing pain. MRIs and x-rays are poor indica-tors of whether the pain is coming from disc disease (rather thanfrom tight muscles or muscle spasm pinching the nerve) as almosteveryone shows normal \u201cwear and tear\u201d in back x-rays.\nFortunately, over 70 percent of back pain from disc disease can\nbe eliminated without surgery by simply giving six intravenousinjections of an old gout medicine called colchicine. Given intra-venously, this medicine gets into the disc space and turns off thein\ufb02ammation and swelling. Relief usually occurs by the \ufb01fth tosixth dose. It is fairly safe, with the main risk being rare and severeallergic reactions (similar to the risk with penicillin) and a nastyskin burn if it leaks out of the IV (the medication has to stay inthe vein, not anywhere else). This can usually be easily avoidedby making sure the IV is \ufb02owing well. I usually recommend thatas long as the IV is in, you also get the IV nutrients in Myers cock-tails (see Chapter 11) because this helps associated muscle pain.T wo studies with more than one thousand patients (one studybeing placebo controlled) have shown the same 70 percent reliefrate that I and others who use it in practice have found. Only onestudy (conducted with fourteen long-term workman\u2019s c ompensa-\ntion patients who had failed all other treatments, where no treat-ment was likely to help) did not show bene\ufb01t.\nThe main problem with the use of IV colchicine in disc dis-\nease is that it is too inexpensive. It costs three dollars per dose forsix doses, with the main cost being that of starting the IV . Becausethere is no money to be made, and it would eliminate most backsurgeons\u2019 business, surgeons are understandably hesitant to look atthe research. One excellent local orthopedist had a staffer whohad disc disease for many years but refused surgery. When shecame to our of\ufb01ce, we treated her with the IV colchicine and thedisc pain, as usual, went away. One night, my partner and I wereout for dinner when the orthopedist entered the restaurant. WhenTREATING OTHER COMMON PAINS BASED ON THEIR LOCATIONS\n153", "he came over to say hello, my partner asked the orthopedist what\nhe thought about his staffer\u2019s pain going away without needingsurgery. The orthopedist ignored the comment and kept on talk-ing as if we had never asked the question.\nTreating Sciatica. Sciatica, or back pain in which the pain goes\ndown the leg, is very common. Sciatica is simply disc disease fromcompression or irritation of the nerve from the foot as it entersthe spine (although a tight muscle can also pinch the nerve). If youlie on the \ufb02oor and lift the painful leg straight up without bend-ing it (while keeping the other leg \ufb02at on the \ufb02oor), it can stretchthe nerve and worsen the pain. This is called the straight leg rais-\ning test . Sciatica also usually goes away by treatment with intra-\nvenous colchicine.\nAdditional Treatments for Disc Disease. It is reasonable to add glu-\ncosamine sulfate, 1,500 mg a day; MSM, 3,000 mg per day; andchondroitin sulfate, 2,500 mg per day. Give this combination a\nsix- to twelve-week trial. In one Russian study, 73 percent ofthose who took the chondroitin had less back pain and moremobility. As noted above, use only low molecular weight chon-droitin (such as the one made by Enzymatic Therapy) as mostothers are poorly absorbed. These compounds may help to rebuildthe cartilage tissue worn away by wear and tear.\nLamictal (lamotrigine, a seizure medicine that acts as a sodium\nchannel blocker with some calcium channel blockade) can also behelpful. In one study with patients who had severe refractory neu-ropathic pain (especially disc pain) and had failed at least twoother treatments, there was an average 70 percent drop in pain infourteen of twenty-one patients using this medication.\nWhat If It Is Not Disc Disease?\nMost other back pain, unless it is coming from your chest orabdominal organs (which is rare and can be found by yourinternist) is muscular. Using the treatments in the chapter onmyofascial pain (Chapter 6) and also taking care of any underly-EVALUATING AND TREATING COMMON TYPES OF PAIN\n154", "ing structural/ergonomic problems (see Chapters 3 and 12) can\nroutinely eliminate this pain. In addition, chiropractic (see Chap-ter 12) and mind-body approaches such as those developed by Dr.Sarno (see Chapter 14) can also be very helpful, as can manyforms of bodywork.\nNoncardiac Chest Pain\nOnce your doctor has ruled out heart or lung problems as a sourceof your chest pain, it most often turns out to be muscle/cartilagepain or indigestion/acid re\ufb02ux. A diagnosis of costoc hondritis\u2014\npain in the chest wall muscles and cartilage\u2014is made by exami-nation and ruling out other problems since lab and other studiesprovide little information about muscle pain. Interestingly, mus-cle pain over the lower half of the chest bone (sternum) is involvedin a re\ufb02ex arc that can both cause and be caused by acid re\ufb02ux.Treating this muscle pain can decrease re\ufb02ux problems as well.\nCostochondritis pain tends to be aggravated by movement,\ndeep breathing, or position change. It tends to be sharp, nagging,aching, or pressure-like, and it is usually fairly well localized,although the pain may radiate. It is usually along the sides of thesternum (the chest bone in the center of the chest), two inchesbelow the left nipple, or in the pectoral muscles in the upper chest.Reproducing the chest pain by pushing on the area suggests thatthe pain is coming from the muscles or ligaments of the chest walland is not dangerous. Nonetheless, it is best to be on the safe sideand have a physician make sure that the pain is not coming fromthe heart.\nHot compresses and relaxing the muscles with your mind can\nbe helpful, as can the treatments for muscle pain discussed inChapter 6. For severe cases, Lidocaine patches can be very help-ful, as can the pain creams. Aspirin family medications such asMotrin can be helpful but can cause indigestion or stomach ulcersand bleeding, which can worsen the chest pain.\nIf the pain is in your solar plexus and midchest and is relieved\nby taking a few ounces of Maalox, Mylanta, or other antacids, orTREATING OTHER COMMON PAINS BASED ON THEIR LOCATIONS\n155", "is affected by eating, it is likely indigestion. (See Chapter 8 for\ninformation on treating pain from indigestion.)\nWhen to Worry\nThe most worrisome causes of chest pain, however, are anginaand heart attacks. These pains are usually associated with tightnessand pain that radiates down the left arm, shortness of breath, andsweats and is made worse with walking or exercise. Everyone isdifferent, however, and sometimes these pains can be atypical. Itis always best to be on the safe side and have a family doctor checkout the source of chest pain to be sure it is not coming from some-thing dangerous. Most doctors are very good at diagnosing andtreating angina and other dangerous causes of chest pain. Oncethese have been ruled out, I would go ahead and apply the treat-ments described in this chapter to help eliminate your chest pain.\nCarpal Tunnel Syndrome and Thumb Tendonitis\nCarpal tunnel syndrome is characterized by pain, numbness, andtingling that occurs in one or both hands. It often wakes peoplefrom their sleep, leaving them feeling like they have to \u201cshaketheir hands out\u201d to make the pain and symptoms go away. Thissyndrome is caused by compression of the median nerve as it goesthrough a narrow tunnel in the wrist formed by the carpal bone,hence the name carpal tunnel syndrome. According to the Amer-ican Academy of Neurology, 10 percent of the population suffersfrom the syndrome. It also affects up to 50 percent of industrialworkers.\nAll too often the syndrome is treated by surgery. Although this\ncan be effective, it is also expensive and can leave people withresidual problems due to the formation of scar tissue that canoccur after surgery.\nNonsurgical Treatment Options for Wrist Pain\nFortunately, unless people are continuing to stress the wrist withrepetitive stress injuries (such as handling heavy equipment orEVALUATING AND TREATING COMMON TYPES OF PAIN\n156", "doing large amounts of typing), carpal tunnel syndrome can\nalmost always be relieved without surgery. In almost all of mypatients, their carpal tunnel syndromes have resolved by simplyusing vitamin B\n6(250 mg daily), Armour thyroid hormone (see\nChapter 2), and a wrist splint for six weeks. When your hand getsinto funny positions while you are sleeping, it stretches and strainsthe nerve as it goes through your wrist. This is why you wake upin the night with numbness or tingling. The type of wrist splintto use is called a \u201ccock up\u201d wrist splint. It keeps your hand in theneutral position (the position your hand is in while holding a glassof water), which takes the stress off the nerve. Be sure to wear thesplint for at least six weeks while you\u2019re sleeping. During thatperiod, also wear it during the day when you can.\nAlthough the treatment I mentioned generally takes care of\ncarpal tunnel syndrome, it is worth being aware of a new treat-ment as well. A portable wrist traction device combines neutralwrist position and stretching to decompress the carpal tunnel. Itis used ten minutes twice a day for one month, followed by tenminutes once a day for a second month. It can be used at home orat work, making it very convenient. At the end of a study ofthirty patients, most had normalization or near normalization ofthe nerve function.\nOther conservative measures can also be effective, including\nacupuncture, osteopathic manipulation, chiropractic manipula-tion, and myofascial release. Unfortunately, your doctor may betotally unfamiliar with these conservative therapies; in today\u2019smedicine only expensive treatments tend to get attention. If sur-gery is recommended, ask your physician if you can try these con-servative measures instead for six to twelve weeks.\nThumb Tendonitis\nThumb tendonitis is characterized by pain along the side of yourhand going from the thumb joint toward the wrist. If you feelaround, you may \ufb01nd a \u201cropy\u201d cord (the tendon) that hurts, withthe pain worsening when you push on it. The pain gels/creams(see Chapters 3, 4, and 13, and see Appendix B for sources) canTREATING OTHER COMMON PAINS BASED ON THEIR LOCATIONS\n157", "work very well for this; but you need to give these medications\nseveral weeks to work. Steroid injections locally are also reason-able, but should not be injected into the tendon.\nShoulder Problems\nFrozen shoulder has many causes, including tendon in\ufb02ammation,bursitis, and injury. Anything that causes pain on motion can trig-ger it. This occurs as the patient stops moving the shoulderbecause of the pain. The shoulder gradually loses mobility, andscar tissue can form around the shoulder joint causing it tobecome frozen. Rotator cuff tears are a common cause. If youhave shoulder pain and \ufb01nd that you can only lift your arm up toshoulder level to the side (a 90-degree angle), a rotator cuff tear islikely.\nThe usual treatments include NSAIDs (discussed in Chapter\n13) and physical therapy (heat, ultrasound, and range of motionexercises). Cortisone injections can also be given. If these treat-ments fail after six to twelve months, surgery to repair the jointmay sometimes be necessary.\nWhen doing range of motion exercises, increase the joint\nmovement up to the point where it causes mild pain, but do notpush through pain as this can further injure the joint. Severalgood stretches for the shoulder include:\n\u2022Using your other hand to lift your hand up to the top of a\ndoor (so that your hand holds on to the top of the door),gently squat down to stretch the shoulder.\n\u2022Putting your arm behind your back and using your other\nhand to gently pull on it and stretch it. (This can also bedone with your arm over your head.)\nIt is good to be sure that you maintain range of motion of your\nshoulder anytime you have shoulder pain to prevent a frozenshoulder.EVALUATING AND TREATING COMMON TYPES OF PAIN\n158", "Leg and Foot Pain\nIn some people, the calf and other leg muscles go into spasm while\nthey are sleeping. A number of treatments can prevent this.\n\u2022Begin by taking the Energy Revitalization System vitamin\npowder (take the vitamin B-complex capsule in the morningand the powder at night).\n\u2022In addition, take calcium 500 to 1,000 mg at bedtime and\nincrease the potassium in your diet (bananas, V8, andtomato juice are good sources of potassium).\n\u2022Stretch your calf muscles before you go to sleep. This can be\ndone by pulling your toes toward you when you\u2019re sitting onyour bed.\n\u2022Wearing socks at night can also help because cold feet will\nsometimes be a trigger.\n\u2022Quinine can be helpful for nighttime leg cramps as well.\nFor most of my patients, the nutritional support I recommend\nplus quinine has done an excellent job in relieving pain from legcramps. Interestingly, several readers of Dr. Peter Gott\u2019s medicalcolumn have noted that leaving a bar of soap (but not Dove orDial soap) under their bed sheet stopped their leg cramps. It seemsodd, but it is cheap, safe, and easy to try.\nFoot Problems\nPlantar fasciitis is the most common cause of pain along the entirebottom of the foot. It occurs when you have a tightness/irritationof the muscles and tissues that form the \u201csuspension bridge\u201d onthe bottom of the foot. This is very common in my \ufb01bromyalgiapatients and routinely goes away with the overall treatment pro-tocol (see Chapter 6). In addition, a podiatrist or chiropractorfamiliar with the technique can tape the bottom of the foot. Thiswas another wonderful trick that Dr. Ron Huse taught me. Thistape then takes over the role of the suspension support and mayease the pain immediately.TREATING OTHER COMMON PAINS BASED ON THEIR LOCATIONS\n159", "Morton\u2019s neuroma is an irritated nerve bundle in the web\nbetween two toes. It hurts when one squeezes that area, repro-ducing the pain. This is best treated by a podiatrist.\nNow that we have examined the various types of pain, the next\npart of this book goes into dozens of different alternative and pre-scription therapies for alleviating common pain problems, includ-ing those that were brie\ufb02y touched on in earlier chapters.EVALUATING AND TREATING COMMON TYPES OF PAIN\n160", "PART III\nEffective Therapies for\nChronic Pain and\nRelated Problems\nAs discussed throughout this book, natural remedies can be power-\nful tools in relieving pain. Because of this, there is often much to begained from working with naturopaths\u2014practitioners trained in nat-ural medicine. These next few chapters cover various herbal andother alternative treatments for chronic pain. We will also review pre-scription pain medications that include topical therapies (creams andgels that can be rubbed directly on the painful areas), oral pain med-ications, and intravenous medications. Finally, we\u2019ll discuss how totackle some common problems that arise from chronic pain includ-ing depression, sexual dysfunction, and weight gain.\n161\nCopyright \u00a9 200 6 by Jacob  Teitelbaum . Click here for terms of use.  ", "This page intentionally left blank ", "Natural Therapies\nUnfortunately, most medical doctors have a strong bias against\nnatural remedies. As one goes into academic centers, this onlyincreases. Although many physicians think that their bias is basedon lack of scienti\ufb01c evidence supporting natural therapies (whatthey like to call \u201cevidence-based medicine\u201d), it is actually simplybased on a lack of awareness of the scienti\ufb01c data.\nMany physicians refuse to objectively look at studies that sup-\nport natural medicine. The people in charge of grants will rarelygive money to study natural therapies. All too often, journalreviewers look for any excuse they can not to publish \ufb01ndings,and many doctors refuse to look at a positive study on naturaltherapies once it is published. Thus physicians can honestly saythey have not seen any data supporting natural remedies. On theother hand, any data against natural remedies seem to get pub-lished\u2014no matter how poorly done the study was and how unre-liable the data are.\nI have repeatedly seen this in action, and this is not just my\nown impression. A study was conducted in which two identicalstudy reports were submitted for publication. The only differencewas that in one study the treatment was an \u201cunconventional\u201dtherapy while the other was a \u201cconventional\u201d treatment. A totalof 398 reviewers were recruited and did not know they were part\n163CHAPTER11\nCopyright \u00a9 200 6 by Jacob  Teitelbaum . Click here for terms of use.  ", "of a study. They simply thought they were reviewing the study\nreports to see whether they should be published. Although thestudy reports were exactly the same (except for using a \u201cconven-tional\u201d or \u201cunconventional\u201d treatment), the studies using con-ventional therapies were much more likely to be recommendedfor publication, suggesting that a strong prejudice exists againstalternative interventions. This makes it much harder for such stud-ies to get published and also suggests that it would be more dif\ufb01-cult to get research funding for studies supporting naturaltherapies.\nWhy Does a Bias Against Natural Remedies Exist?\nA curious thing happened during the rigorous process I wentthrough to become a physician. By the time I completed my for-mal training, I presumed that if an important treatment existed foran illness, I would have been taught about it. I understood thatphysicians need to keep reading to stay abreast of new informa-tion. But I knew that if someone claimed he or she could effec-tively treat a nontreatable disease, that person was a quack. If sucha treatment existed, I would surely have been taught about it inmedical school. I was wrong.\nDr. Werner Barth, my rheumatology instructor, taught me\nmany things. The most important thing he taught me, though,was to spend an hour a day reading the scienti\ufb01c literature. Thispractice has gotten me into all kinds of trouble.\nWhen I \ufb01rst started my medical practice, patients would ask\nme if I knew about certain herbal or nutritional treatments for ill-nesses. One patient asked me if I had ever heard about using vita-min B \u2086for carpal tunnel syndrome. \u201cThat\u2019s nonsense,\u201d I answered.\n\u201cIf B \u2086cures carpal tunnel syndrome, don\u2019t you think I would have\nbeen taught to use that instead of surgery?\u201d However, I said thatI would look into it.\nJoyce Miller, the Anne Arundel Medical Center librarian, has\nalways been happy to obtain studies for me (and she has obtainedEFFECTIVE THERAPIES FOR CHRONIC PAIN AND RELATED PROBLEMS\n164", "many thousands over the years). When she did a literature search\nfor vitamin B \u2086and carpal tunnel syndrome, she found a number\nof studies showing that 250 mg of the vitamin per day for threemonths, combined with wrist splints, often cures carpal tunnelsyndrome. I thought that was curious. Over the months, this scenewas played out again and again. I decided to keep notes on theserare \u201cpearls\u201d in a thirty-page spiral notebook. My notes are nowover one thousand pages long.\nAfter a while, I began to comprehend that, indeed, my pro-\nfessors had not taught me everything in medical school. As Icontinued my research, I realized that although our modernallopathic medical system might be the best in the world, it hasits weaknesses.\nMoney: A Critical Issue\nMoney strongly colors drug research; there is much more moneyto be made on patentable drugs than on nonpatentable naturalremedies. In fact, research done by Cary Gross at Yale shows thatstudies funded by a drug company are 3.6 times as likely to havea result favorable to the sponsor. A quarter of biomedical research-ers have \ufb01nancial ties to the companies whose products they arestudying. Drug companies fund approximately 60 percent of thebiomedical research done in the United States, spending over $30billion yearly on research and development. In addition, becauseuniversities can patent and license the results of positive research,there is a further incentive to skew the data on drug therapies overnatural, nonpatentable treatments.\nIn addition, these days, it is rare (albeit wonderful) for a major\nmedical development to come out of a doctor\u2019s of\ufb01ce instead of aresearch center. This stems from a critical drawback in our eco-nomic system (and all systems have their drawbacks). In our cur-rent system, a treatment must be very pro\ufb01table to be promoted.Experts estimate that it costs more than $400 million on averageto develop a single new treatment and get it through the Food andDrug Administration (FDA) approval process. Unless a medica-NATURAL THERAPIES\n165", "tion or supplement is put through the FDA approval process, its\nmanufacturer is banned from making any medical claims for theproduct. However, if a product is inexpensive and nonpatentable(as is the case with most natural therapies), its manufacturer can-not afford to pay $400 million to put it through the FDA process.\nVitamin B \u2086, when used for carpal tunnel syndrome, is an excel-\nlent example. Treating carpal tunnel syndrome with B \u2086costs about\nnine dollars for the whole course of treatment. Vitamin B \u2086man-\nufacturers would, therefore, \ufb01nd it impossible to recoup the costof getting FDA approval for this treatment. Because of this, mostpatients instead spend between two thousand and four thousanddollars to have surgery. This situation is the same for hundreds ofother nonpatentable, effective, inexpensive, and relatively safetreatments.\nNot Knowing the Scienti\ufb01c Research\nThe treatment approaches that we discuss in Pain Free 1-2-3 are\nwell-grounded in the scienti\ufb01c literature. Dr. Janet Travell, pro-fessor emeritus of internal medicine at George Washington Uni-versity Medical School, was considered the world\u2019s leading experton muscle disorders. She served as the White House physician forPresidents John F . Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson and, alongwith Dr. David Simons (who is also superb), authored the overeight-hundred-page bible on treating muscle disorders entitledMyofascial Pain and Dysfunction: The Trigger Point Manual . Dr.\nTravell and Dr. Simons investigated the perpetuating factors thatkeep muscles from appropriately relaxing. A large percentage ofthese perpetuating factors are the things that we discuss in thisbook. In one chapter alone, Dr. Simons and Dr. Travell referenced317 scienti\ufb01c studies that showed how important it is to treat theseperpetuating factors. There is no lack of scienti\ufb01c basis for treat-ment, just a lack of awareness of the treatments due to their rela-tive low cost and nonpatentability.\nUnfortunately, your doctor is likely to be unfamiliar with the\nresearch on effective treatment of myofascial pain and \ufb01bromyal-EFFECTIVE THERAPIES FOR CHRONIC PAIN AND RELATED PROBLEMS\n166", "gia. It is possible that your doctor may even be hostile to the\ninformation presented in this book, considering it to be quackerybecause it was not covered in medical school. I can understand hisor her feeling this way, because I felt the same way before I exten-sively reviewed the medical literature. Because of this, I have ref-erenced many of the sources of the information given so that yourdoctor can have the scienti\ufb01c basis needed to be comfortable withthe recommendations I make.\nIt is possible that your doctor may choose to disregard the\ninformation, and that is OK. It simply says that he or she is notinterested in this area of pain management. On the other hand,your doctor might be open-minded (though reasonably skeptical)and interested in effective treatment of pain and, therefore, maychoose to explore the subject in more depth. If this last possibil-ity is the case, the information and references in this book willgive your doctor the scienti\ufb01c basis necessary to manage and opti-mize your treatment.\nThree Effective Natural Pain Therapies\nMany natural therapies can be very helpful for pain. My threefavorite pain-relieving herbals are willow bark, boswellia, andcherry. All three can be found in combination in the End Painformula by Enzymatic Therapy (see Appendix B). Begin with twoto four tablets three times a day, as needed, until maximum ben-e\ufb01t is achieved (approximately four to six weeks), and then youcan use the lowest effective dose. For acute pain three or fourtablets at a time is best. Let\u2019s look more closely at these threeherbals.\nWillow Bark\nWillow bark is the original source of aspirin, but when used as theentire herb it has been found to be much safer than aspirin andmore effective. The active ingredient is salicin, and willow barkhas been shown to be effective in both osteoarthritis and backNATURAL THERAPIES\n167", "pain. People who are severely allergic to aspirin (those with\naspirin-induced asthma or anaphylaxes, which are very unusual)should not use willow bark. Like aspirin and Celebrex, willowbark acts as a cyclooxygenase enzyme (COX) inhibitor, decreas-ing in\ufb02ammation.\nThere is clearly a combination of other elements in willow\nbark that markedly enhances its effectiveness and safety\u2014whichcan be a major bene\ufb01t over aspirin and NSAIDs such as Motrin.Unfortunately aspirin and NSAIDs cause an enormous amount ofgastritis and ulcer bleeding to the extent of killing \ufb01fteen thou-sand to twenty thousand Americans yearly! The studies on wil-low bark are quite consistent in showing its effectiveness andsafety in reducing pain. Let\u2019s look at some of the research.\nIn one study, 210 patients with severe chronic low back pain\nwere randomly assigned to receive an oral willow bark extract,with either 120 mg (low dose) or 240 mg (high dose) of salicin,or placebo, in a four-week blinded trial. In the last week of treat-ment, 39 percent of the group receiving high-dose extract werepain free; 21 percent of the group receiving low-dose extractwere pain free; and only 6 percent of the placebo group were painfree. The response in the high-dose group was evident after onlyone week of treatment. Researchers then studied 451 patientswho came in with low back pain in an open study, using salicin240 mg, 120 mg, or standard orthopedic/NSAID care for fourweeks. Forty percent of the patients in the 240 mg group and 19percent in the 120 mg group were pain free after four weeks. Inthe standard treatment group, using standard medications, only 18percent were pain free. The study showed that willow bark wasnot only far more effective and safer than standard prescriptiontherapies, it also decreased the cost of care by approximately 40percent!\nAnother review found that willow bark extract has anti-\nin\ufb02ammatory activities comparable to much higher doses ofacetylsalicylic acid/aspirin, and it reduces pain and fever as well.In pharmacologically active doses, no adverse effects on the stom-EFFECTIVE THERAPIES FOR CHRONIC PAIN AND RELATED PROBLEMS\n168", "ach lining (indigestion, ulcers) were observed, in contrast to\naspirin.\nA daily dose of willow bark extract standardized to 240 mg\nsalicin per day was also signi\ufb01cantly superior to placebo in patientswith osteoarthritis of the hip and the knee. In two open studiesagainst standard active treatments as controls, willow bark extractexhibited advantages compared to NSAIDs and was about aseffective as Vioxx (but much safer). Another study found that wil-low bark (salicin 240 mg/day) was much more effective thanplacebo in treating arthritis (the normal wear-and-tear type calledosteoarthritis) after only two weeks of therapy.\nAll of this information makes willow bark a wonderful natu-\nral pain medicine. It is safe and effective for arthritis, back pain,and likely many other types of pain. I recommend beginning withenough to get 240 mg of salicin a day (six tablets of the End Painformula) until maximum bene\ufb01t is seen. At that point, you maybe able to lower the dose to 120 mg or less a day, or take it asneeded.\nBoswellia\nBoswellia serrata , also known as frankincense, has been used in tra-\nditional Ayurvedic medicine for centuries. Boswellia has beenfound to be quite helpful in treating in\ufb02ammation and pain, andit does this without causing ulcers like aspirin family medications.It has been shown in studies to be helpful for both rheumatoidarthritis and osteoarthritis.\nIn one study, thirty patients with osteoarthritis of the knee\nwere given 1,000 mg of either an extract of boswellia or a placebofor eight weeks; the groups were then switched for the next eightweeks. All of the patients on the boswellia showed signi\ufb01cantlydecreased pain and improved ability to walk. In fact, the improve-ment was quite remarkable, with the pain index falling by 90 per-cent after eight weeks and a similarly dramatic increase infunction! This was recently discussed in more length in an articlewritten by Kerry Bone for the wonderful patient-oriented news-NATURAL THERAPIES\n169", "letter Nutrition and Healing by Jonathan Wright, M.D.\u2014a physi-\ncian that I have great respect for. (See wrightnewsletter.com.)\nBoswellia has also been demonstrated to have signi\ufb01cant anti-\nin\ufb02ammatory properties. Unique to boswellia is that it blocks twoin\ufb02ammatory chemicals that are increased simultaneously in avariety of human diseases. This results in its being helpful inasthma and colitis, as well as pain. In one study of asthmatics,forty patients were treated with 300 mg three times day for sixweeks. Seventy percent of the asthma patients showed improve-ment in symptoms and lung function and a decrease in allergicblood cells (eosinophils).\nBoswellia also helped in the treatment of ulcerative colitis. In\none study of twenty patients in which boswellia, 300 mg threetimes a day, was given for six weeks, fourteen went into remis-sion, while with sulfasalazine (the standard prescription treat-ment), the remission rate was four out of ten. T est tube studiessuggest that Boswellia also markedly inhibits cancer.\nBoswellia does not appear to have any major side effects that\nresulted in people withdrawing from the studies, and it rarelycauses minor gastrointestinal disturbances or rash. A commondose is 150 to 350 mg three times a day.\nCherry (Prunus Cerasus)\nAlthough there are not as many human studies on the use of cher-ries, they also contain compounds that inhibit COX (in\ufb02amma-tion) as effectively as ibuprofen. Cherries also possess bothantioxidant and anti-in\ufb02ammatory properties. In addition,research suggests that cherries may also inhibit colon and perhapsother cancers. Cherries and other colored berries are very high inmany antioxidants. As with eating cherries, taking cherry fruitextract is quite safe. Many people \ufb01nd that eating ten to twentycherries a day helps their arthritis considerably. Taking 2,000 mgof cherry fruit extract (present in six tablets of the End Pain for-mula) contains the active components present in ten cherries orthirty-two ounces of cherry juice. Early research, as well as howEFFECTIVE THERAPIES FOR CHRONIC PAIN AND RELATED PROBLEMS\n170", "many people come back for more after they have tried it, which\nto me is a signi\ufb01cant indicator of effectiveness, suggests thatcherry fruit extract holds a lot of promise!\nOther Important Natural Healing Ingredients\nAs we discussed earlier, pain is often your body\u2019s way of tellingyou that it desperately needs something\u2014and what it needs is usu-ally natural and not chemical. Let\u2019s review the key things yourbody needs and how you can give it what it needs naturally.\nNutritional Support\nFirst you need to give your body the nutritional building blocksit needs to heal. Otherwise, your body cannot even begin to getwell (see Chapter 2). As you\u2019ve noticed, I\u2019ve talked about theEnergy Revitalization System vitamin powder and B-complexcapsule at length. This is because this formula has over \ufb01fty keynutrients that serve an enormous number of needs. Many peoplehave told me that using the formula by itself eliminated theirchronic pain!\nGlucosamine Sulfate and Chondroitin\nNext, although the vitamin powder has most of what your bodyneeds, joints require other speci\ufb01c nutrients for healing. So if youhave arthritis or back pain from arthritis of the spine, considertaking glucosamine sulfate, MSM (methylsulfonylmethane), andchondroitin (see Chapter 5).\nLipoic Acid and SAM-e\nOther nutrients are also critical for nerve healing. One such ele-ment is lipoic acid, 300 to 1,000 mg per day. Alpha lipoic acid isan antioxidant that has been shown to be especially bene\ufb01cial fordiabetic neuropathy. The fact that lipoic acid helps in several kindsof neuropathies suggests it is worth trying in others as well, espe-cially since it is quite benign and not very expensive.NATURAL THERAPIES\n171", "SAM-e is a nutrient produced from trimethylglycine (betaine)\nin combination with multiple nutrients, including B vitamins,folate, and inositol. It was initially tested and found to be effectivein treating depression. Researchers also noted, as an aside, that itimproved patients\u2019 arthritis as effectively as anti-in\ufb02ammatorymedications (NSAIDs) (see Chapter 5).\nNatural Remedies for Sleep\nAs previously discussed in Chapter 2, your repair cycle occursduring sleep and your body needs eight to nine hours of sleep anight for optimal healing. Unfortunately, insomnia often accom-panies pain. The good news is that many natural remedies that arevery effective for sleep also directly help pain. Most of the natu-ral sleep remedies discussed here are not sedating, yet they willhelp you fall asleep and stay in deep sleep. Some are available incombination formulas as well.\nWild Lettuce and Jamaican Dogwood\nTraditionally, wild lettuce has been found to be wonderful foranxiety and insomnia, as well as for headaches, muscles, and jointpain. Wild lettuce also helps to calm restlessness and reduceanxiety.\nIn addition, the extract from Jamaican dogwood acts as a mus-\ncle relaxant and also helps people to fall asleep while calmingthem. According to tradition, Jamaican dogwood was used byJamaican \ufb01shermen. Large amounts were thrown in the water.The \ufb01sh would then be sedated and easy to net.\nHops and Theanine\nHops are a member of the hemp family, and the female \ufb02owers areused in beer making. Hops stimulate some hormonal activity; cansuppress breast, colon, and ovarian cancer in test tube studies; andhave been reported to reduce hot \ufb02ashes in menopausal women.Hops are also associated with antibiotic and antifungal activity.EFFECTIVE THERAPIES FOR CHRONIC PAIN AND RELATED PROBLEMS\n172", "They have a long history of being used as a mild sedative for anx-\niety and insomnia. They also inhibit in\ufb02ammation. A study using120 mg of hops combined with 500 mg of valerian showed animprovement in insomnia with effectiveness similar to Valiumfamily medications. Hops are considered to be very safe.\nTheanine comes from green tea and has been shown to\nimprove deep sleep and to help people maintain calm alertnessduring the day. Green tea also is helpful as an immune stimulantand has many other bene\ufb01ts.\nPassion\ufb02ower (Passi\ufb02ora)\nPassion\ufb02ower is an excellent herb used throughout South Amer-ica as a calming agent and is even present in sodas. In fact, it is notuncommon for friends to tell an anxious person, \u201cWhy don\u2019t yougo get a passion\ufb02ower drink.\u201d The active component is in theleaves. Herbalists use passion\ufb02ower to treat muscle spasms, colic,dysentery, diarrhea, anxiety, and menstrual pain. A number ofstudies support its having a calming effect. Early data also suggestthat it may increase men\u2019s libido. Passion\ufb02ower has other painmanagement bene\ufb01ts as well. In one animal study, it was shownto decrease morphine tolerance and withdrawal, thereby improv-ing morphine\u2019s effectiveness and safety.\nValerian\nValerian is commonly used as a remedy for insomnia. Oneplacebo-controlled study showed that people taking valerian(400 mg of extract each night for two weeks) fell asleep morequickly and had better sleep quality without next-day sedation.Another placebo-controlled study using 450 and 900 mg doses forjust one night also showed improved sleep, but there was somehangover with the higher dose. A number of other studies alsoshow bene\ufb01t, including an improvement in deep sleep. The ben-e\ufb01ts were most pronounced when people used valerian forextended periods as opposed to simply taking it for one night.Another study showed it to be as effective as a Valium familyNATURAL THERAPIES\n173", "medication (oxazepam). A review of multiple studies concluded,\n\u201cValerian is a safe herbal choice for the treatment of mild insom-nia and has good tolerance.\u201d Most studies suggest that it is moreeffective when used continuously rather than as an acute sleep aid.\nCombining Remedies for Fuller Effect\nBecause I have found all six of these herbals to be dramaticallyhelpful in patients with disordered sleep, anxiety, and/or chronicpain, I had them all combined in the Revitalizing Sleep Formula(see Appendix B). One to four capsules can be taken at bedtimeto help sleep, or an hour before bedtime if the main problem isfalling asleep. Y ou\u2019ll see the effect of a given dose on sleep the \ufb01rstnight you take it, although the effectiveness increases with con-tinued use. It can also be used during the day for anxiety and mus-cle pain. Although the bottle says to take up to four capsules a day,one could take up to three or four capsules two or three timeseach day, as it is very safe. If you\u2019re still not getting eight to ninehours of sleep a night, magnesium (75 to 250 mg) and calcium(600 mg) at bedtime also help sleep. It can also be used togetherwith the End Pain formula for more powerful pain relief.\nBesides these herbs, I recommend the natural sleep aids in the\nfollowing sections.\nHydroxy L-Tryptophan (5-HTP)\nTake 200 to 400 mg at night. When used for six weeks, a 300 to400 mg dose has been shown to decrease \ufb01bromyalgia pain andoften helps people to lose weight. Y our body uses 5-HTP to makeserotonin, a neurotransmitter that helps improve the quality ofsleep while also decreasing levels of substance P , your body\u2019s painmessenger. The one caution I give is that if you are taking othertreatments that increase serotonin (these include antidepressantssuch as Prozac, Saint-John\u2019s-wort, Ultram, Desyrel, and others),limit the 5-HTP to 200 mg at night. It takes six to twelve weeksto see the full effect of 5-HTP , and it is more expensive than theEFFECTIVE THERAPIES FOR CHRONIC PAIN AND RELATED PROBLEMS\n174", "other remedies. Nonetheless, it may be worthwhile in treating\nchronic pain.\nMelatonin\nThis is a hormone produced by the pineal gland. Although mela-tonin is natural and available over the counter, this does not meanthat it is without risk. My concern with any hormone is thatalthough it might be quite safe when used within the body\u2019s nor-mal range, I worry about toxicity when people take more than thebody would normally make. For most people, all it takes to restoremelatonin to normal levels is 0.5 mg. The usual dose you \ufb01nd instores, however, is 3 mg, which is six to ten times the dose thatmost people need. Except for a small subset of people, who likelyhave trouble absorbing it properly, the 0.5 mg dose is every bit aseffective for sleep as higher doses. I would use a dose higher than0.5 mg only if it clearly helps you sleep better than the lower dose.\nAdditional Safe and Inexpensive Natural\nRemedies for Pain\nMany other natural therapies can be powerfully effective in the\ntreatment of pain while also being safe and relatively inexpensive.Although we do not have space to review all of them, let\u2019s look ata few that are worth being aware of.\nTopical Gels for Muscle and Arthritis Pain\nI am a big fan of using topical therapies (see Chapter 13). Byapplying these gels directly to a targeted area of pain, you get ahigh dose to where it\u2019s needed without saturating your wholebody as you do with tablets.\nA promising product for the relief of muscle and arthritis pain\ndoes just that. Joint Gel by NF Formulas is an over-the-counternatural pain reliever that is applied directly on the skin. It containsmenthol, MSM (methylsulfonylmethane), white willow, pineNATURAL THERAPIES\n175", "bark, and botanical oils that provide relief of aches and pains. Joint\nGel also can relieve the pain of backaches, muscle sprains, andstrains. Its roll-on design delivers the gel directly onto the skinand does not leave an oily or sticky feeling. As you massage theJoint Gel over the painful joint or muscle until absorbed, you\u2019llinitially feel the menthol. The active ingredient in peppermint ismenthol, which serves as a counterirritant, stimulating the nervesthat perceive cold while simultaneously depressing those for pain.Joint Gel\u2019s aloe leaf, white willow bark, and MSM (discussed ear-lier in this chapter) are also well known for their natural pain-relieving properties. Pine bark also provides unique antioxidantsknown to play a role in the stabilization of joints and muscles.Because it contains eucalyptus, rosemary, and ginger botanicaloils, Joint Gel smells good. Y ou can use Joint Gel three to fourtimes daily.\nOral Enzymes That Treat In\ufb02ammation\nAnother wonderful treatment for in\ufb02ammation is the use of oralenzymes. For those looking for a gentle, natural, and fairly sideeffect free method of reducing in\ufb02ammation, digestive enzymescan be very helpful. When taken with food, enzymes help digestfats, proteins, and carbohydrates. When taken in between meals,digestive enzymes are absorbed into the bloodstream and areactive throughout the body, not just in the digestive tract. Thisallows them to perform other functions such as combating in\ufb02am-mation. My favorite enzyme supplements for pain and in\ufb02amma-tion are MegaZyme and Ultrazyme. They contain pancreaticenzymes (protease, amylase, and lipase), trypsin, papain, brome-lain, lysozyme, and chymotrypsin.\nEnzymes in high doses may \u201cdigest\u201d in\ufb02ammation by remov-\ning \ufb01brin from in\ufb02amed areas, thereby restoring drainage andreducing swelling. This speeds wound healing. For example, onestudy used bromelain, an enzyme derived from the stem of thepineapple plant, in 146 boxers with multiple face bruises and blackand blue marks after a boxing match. Half the boxers received theEFFECTIVE THERAPIES FOR CHRONIC PAIN AND RELATED PROBLEMS\n176", "real thing and half received placebo. All signs of bruising disap-\npeared within four days in 78 percent of the boxers receivingbromelain as compared to only 14 percent of those on a placebo.By working with your body, bromelain is able to reduce pain andin\ufb02ammation caused by numerous health problems. It can alsoimprove circulation. Bromelain helps the body make its ownenzymes to dissolve and clean up dead tissue and debris from thesite of in\ufb02ammation.\nSome physicians are under the misconception that enzymes\ntaken by mouth would simply be digested and not absorbed intothe body. This is not the case when they are taken on an emptystomach. In this situation enzymes are well absorbed, raising theirlevels in the blood.\nIn addition to decreasing in\ufb02ammation, taking enzymes may\nhelp improve function in other ways. Enzymes are necessary formany reactions to take place within your body\u2019s cells, such asassisting with rejuvenation and healing. For example, studiesshowed that taking large doses of pancreatic enzymes could helppeople with pancreatic cancer to live longer. Research by Dr.Gonzalez has shown this to be the case, and a larger scale studyusing this enzyme treatment in pancreatic cancer is now beingfunded by the National Cancer Institute. Many people have foundthat taking enzymes can markedly help decrease in\ufb02ammatorypain. For example, in one study of muscle soreness after downhillrunning, subjects were given either enzymes or a placebo. In theenzyme group, muscle soreness was much less than in the placebogroup.\nAlthough I strongly recommend that people use plant-based\nenzymes for digestion, pancreatic enzymes are better for in\ufb02am-mation. The pancreatic enzymes in Ultrazyme and MegaZymeare very high potency. The other enzymes present are also pow-erfully effective. Papain is often used to relieve the in\ufb02ammationand pain in sports injuries because athletes have discovered that itspeeds up the healing process. Papain has also been used to reducein\ufb02ammation from wisdom tooth extractions, root canals, andNATURAL THERAPIES\n177", "other oral surgeries. Unlike prescription anti-in\ufb02ammatories such\nas Prednisone (a powerful, prescription-only corticosteroid med-ication with a long list of health risks), enzymes treat in\ufb02amma-tion safely.\nT o summarize, although enzymes such as Ultrazyme and\nMegaZyme may be helpful in aiding digestion of your food whentaken with meals, I recommend that you take them on an empty\nstomach because enzymes are most effective at reducing pain andin\ufb02ammation when you take them between meals. For acute pain,enzymes can simply be taken for a few days as needed. For chronicpain, begin by taking either of them regularly (two to threetablets three times a day) between meals for six to twelve weeksto see how much it helps or until the pain and in\ufb02ammation aregone. Then you can take the enzymes as needed.\nIntravenous \u201cMyers Cocktails\u201d Nutritional Therapies\nA major problem in chronic pain is that the areas that hurt oftenhave decreased blood \ufb02ow. That means that even when you feedyour body, the areas in pain may still be starved. This is one rea-son why using the intravenous \u201cMyers cocktails\u201d nutritional ther-apies can be so effective. (More information is available atvitality101.com.) The magnesium in the IV causes the closed-down blood vessels in your muscles and brain to open, \ufb02oodingthe starved areas with nutrients and washing away toxins. Unfor-tunately, although very worthwhile, these IV treatments requirerepeat visits by a nurse and cost approximately eighty to one hun-dred dollars per dose.\nAnother way to get the blood vessels to open wide is to take a\nB vitamin called niacin (not niacinamide, which does not cause\ufb02ushing). This trick was taught to me by a brilliant chiropractorand pain specialist, Ron Huse, D.C. (phone 281-996-8100), inHouston, T exas. Take 100 to 500 mg of niacin three to four timesa day, as needed, to cause a \u201c\ufb02ushing\u201d feeling, which occurswithin approximately ten to twenty minutes. This can signi\ufb01-cantly help pain and is inexpensive. Try to keep the dose atEFFECTIVE THERAPIES FOR CHRONIC PAIN AND RELATED PROBLEMS\n178", "1,000 mg a day or less, if this is enough to cause \ufb02ushing, because\nhigher doses can sometimes (but rarely) cause liver in\ufb02ammationor unmask diabetes. This treatment also helps to lower cholesteroland is often used for this purpose. The \ufb02ushing will make you feellike you are in the Florida sun for about \ufb01fteen to forty-\ufb01ve min-utes and will often be intense. Do not worry; it is not dangerousand can help your muscles to heal while decreasing pain.\nArnica: A Powerful Homeopathic\nThe classic homeopathic for acute tissue injuries is arnica. Thiscan be highly effective and is available as a cream (Traumeel bythe Heel Company). This is a product that should be in every-body\u2019s medicine cabinet.\nTurmeric ( Curcumin Longa )\nTurmeric is an ingredient in curry powder and a relative of gin-\nger. Turmeric contains curcumin, which has been shown to be aneffective antioxidant. A study of forty-\ufb01ve days of supplementa-tion with curcumin showed marked decreases (60 percent) in thelevel of serum lipid peroxide. It is suspected that the curcuminmight therefore reduce the risk of heart disease, cancer, andin\ufb02ammatory conditions, and it may also help asthma. A reviewof several studies suggests that curcumin has anti-in\ufb02ammatory,antioxidant, anticarcinogenic, antiviral, and anti-infectious activ-ities. A common dose would be 500 to 1000 mg three times a day.\nUnfortunately, curcumin is poorly absorbed in the absence of\npiperine\u2014a compound that comes from black pepper. Piperinecan increase the absorption of many different substances and med-ications, potentially leading to toxic blood levels, however, andshould therefore be used with caution\u2014preferably with their usebeing guided by a health practitioner. When used in combinationwith boswellia, turmeric has been shown to improve bothosteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis.\nIn traditional Indian medicine, curcumin has been used to\ntreat arthritis, in\ufb02ammation, skin disease, and infections for manyNATURAL THERAPIES\n179", "centuries. It contains at least 133 active compounds, and approx-\nimately four hundred studies have been published on curcumin inthe last several years. It has also been found to be effective intreating gastric ulcers and indigestion as well as lowering serumcholesterol.\nGinger and Butterbur\nGinger acts to decrease in\ufb02ammation by inhibiting two keyenzymes (cyclooxygenase and lipooxygenase, with secondaryleukotriene inhibition). Although studies suggest some bene\ufb01twith arthritis, I consider the effect to be modest compared to theEnd Pain formula. Butterbur has been found effective in the pre-vention and treatment of migraine headaches (see Chapter 7).\nSaint-John\u2019s-Wort\nSaint-John\u2019s-wort has been found to be helpful in treating neuro-pathic pain for some people (see Chapter 4). This treatment is safeand inexpensive and helps depression, so it is worth a try\u2014espe-cially if other treatments have failed.\nMarijuana\nAlthough it may seem odd to include marijuana as an herbal, it isan herb, and it is my job to give you medical information regard-less of the politics involved. Studies suggest that the receptors thatmarijuana binds to can also decrease pain. In addition, it candecrease the suffering associated with pain, improve appetite insituations where weight loss is associated with pain (as in cancer),and is likely much safer than many other medications. The activeingredient in marijuana, THC, is available by prescription in amedication called Marinol. It is, of course, much more expensivein this form and probably not as effective, but it can be helpful.\nCapsaicin\nCapsaicin is another cream that comes from hot chili peppers. Itworks by depleting the substance P pain transmitter in nerve end-ings, interfering with the ability to send pain signals to the brain.EFFECTIVE THERAPIES FOR CHRONIC PAIN AND RELATED PROBLEMS\n180", "It can be very helpful in some situations, but I tend to avoid using\nit. I am uncomfortable with irritating the body so much that itdepletes the pain-sending chemicals. In addition, capsaicin canmake the problem worse by stimulating pain when it is \ufb01rst used,and it has to be taken regularly or the pain-sending chemicals havea chance to recover.\nAn Easy-to-Make Home Remedy\nThe following home remedy, Purple Pectin for Pain, is inexpen-sive and easy to try. It is especially geared to work for arthritis.(Please let me know how it works for you! Y ou can send me mes-sages or questions at vitality101.com.)\nPurchase Certo, the thickening agent used to make jams and\njellies, in the canning section of your local grocery. Certo con-tains pectin, a natural ingredient found in the cell walls of plants.Take one to three tablespoons of Certo in eight ounces of grapejuice one to two times daily (you can try more if you wish). If it\u2019sgoing to help, you\u2019ll likely know in seven to fourteen days. Y oucan lower the dose as you feel better.\nAs you can hopefully tell by this chapter, there are many natural\nand prescription treatments available that can be helpful. Y ou donot have to be in pain. There are other excellent natural therapiesto consider, and these are simply a sampling of my favorite natu-ral remedies.NATURAL THERAPIES\n181", "This page intentionally left blank ", "Alternative\nTreatments\nThere are many alternative therapies that can be very effective for\ntreating chronic pain. These include structural therapies such asosteopathic and chiropractic medicine and other techniques suchas hypnosis, magnets, and prolotherapy, which are described inthis chapter. In addition, Peter Marinakis, Ph.D., director of FullCircle Healing Arts in Annapolis, Maryland, provides valuableinformation on how acupuncture\u2014one of the oldest, most com-monly used medical procedures in the world\u2014can help treat pain.Many forms of body and energy work can also be powerfullyeffective in treating pain. Some, such as Rol\ufb01ng (see Chapter 3),we discussed in earlier chapters. These are simply some examplesout of dozens of different forms of body/structural/energy workthat can be powerfully effective.\nOsteopathy\nOsteopathy combines both pharmacologic/surgical medicine andan emphasis on the interrelationship between structure and func-tion in the body. It also has an appreciation of the body\u2019s ability\n183CHAPTER12\nCopyright \u00a9 200 6 by Jacob  Teitelbaum . Click here for terms of use.  ", "to heal itself. There are fourteen principles of osteopathic philos-\nophy. Here are a few of them:\n\u2022The body is a single system that includes mind and spirit as\nwell as muscles, bones, and organs.\n\u2022The body is capable of self-healing, self-regulation, and self-\nmaintenance.\n\u2022The structure of parts of the body will affect the\nfunctioning of those body parts.\n\u2022Treatment should consider the unity of the body, as well as\nthe interactions of speci\ufb01c treatments, and should harness thebody\u2019s self-regulatory ability to heal as much as possible.\nWhere in the past, osteopathy was viewed as providing more\nnatural therapies, some osteopathic physicians are becoming moreand more like M.D.s. Others are taking full advantage of thestrength of combining osteopathic manipulation and naturalremedies with prescription and surgical therapies. Pain is the mostcommon reason why patients seek osteopathic manipulation.Although this is a marked oversimpli\ufb01cation, osteopathic manip-ulative treatment (OMT) is the manual application of forces to thebody to restore maximal pain-free movement of the muscu-loskeletal system. Osteopathy looks at restrictions in movementand asymmetry of body parts. Manipulative therapy is then usedto restore balance and range of motion. A trained osteopathic canwork wonders in ways that are both safe and cost effective.\nChiropractic Medicine\nChiropractic medicine is a health-care discipline that focuses onthe relationship between the spine and body function, coordi-nated via the nervous system. Chiropractic practitioners feel thatthis relationship is critical in maintaining and restoring health.Spinal manipulation was used as early as 2700 b.c.in Chinese\nmedicine, and manipulation techniques were also used by Hip-pocrates and Galen.EFFECTIVE THERAPIES FOR CHRONIC PAIN AND RELATED PROBLEMS\n184", "A bit over one hundred years ago, David Palmer developed the\nprinciples upon which modern chiropractic is based. He believedthat abnormal nerve function was a primary cause of medical prob-lems, and he recommended adjustments to the spine to treat this.Although some physicians accepted his principles, others objectedto anybody who proposed any treatments besides their own. Thisresulted in Palmer and other early chiropractors being arrested. Thisrift between chiropractors and medical doctors persisted with theAmerican Medical Association (AMA) even saying that it wasunethical for any physician to work with a chiropractor and that anydoctor who did so could lose his or her license. This continueduntil the AMA lost an antitrust suit brought by the chiropractors.\nAs is the case in many \ufb01elds, growth occurred in many differ-\nent directions in chiropractic. The more conservative chiroprac-tors believed that poor alignment in the spine (subluxation) wasthe only problem that needed to be treated. Other chiropractorsrecognize that multiple causes could be at play, and they workalongside physicians and other practitioners.\nChiropractors are the most commonly used health practition-\ners after physicians and dentists. There are more than sixty thou-sand licensed chiropractors in the United States. Almost 80percent of chiropractic visits are for musculoskeletal c omplaints,\nand more than 40 percent are for back pain. In 1999, 11 percentof adults and more than 30 percent of patients with low back painvisited a chiropractor.\nAs chiropractic medicine has continued to grow, more than\none hundred different approaches have been developed. Most fallunder the following categories:\n\u2022Manipulation to decrease joint restriction, increase range of\nmotion, and restore vertebrae to their normal position\n\u2022Traction\n\u2022Massage/soft tissue mobilization directed at muscle, tendon,\nand other nonbony tissues\n\u2022Electrical muscle stimulation\n\u2022Diathermy\u2014using electrical currents to produce heatALTERNATIVE TREATMENTS\n185", "\u2022Ultrasound\n\u2022Ice therapy\n\u2022Heat\n\u2022Exercise-based programs\n\u2022Nutritional and metabolic support\n\u2022Energy medicine\nBecause body manipulation requires hands-on therapy, it is\nvery dif\ufb01cult to do a double-blind study. This has been used bysome traditional physicians as an excuse to ignore and put downchiropractic while conveniently forgetting that surgery faces thesame scienti\ufb01c problem. Also, because the types of chiropractictreatment vary so widely, it is dif\ufb01cult to compare the results ofdifferent studies. Nonetheless, chiropractic treatment has survivedbecause people \ufb01nd it to be helpful and often safer than usingmedications.\nHypnosis and Magnets\nAlthough a detailed discussion of these therapies is outside thescope of this book, hypnosis and magnets can both be very help-ful in the treatment of chronic pain. I have seen hypnosis decreasethe intensity of pain, change its location, decrease the sufferingassociated with pain, and change the sensation so that it feels likewarmth or softness instead of pain. When using magnets, the typeof magnet used is important because the strength and \ufb01eld con-\ufb01guration can be critical. Nikkan Company magnets seem to befairly reliable.\nProlotherapy\nProlotherapy is a series of injections of a natural solution (some-thing as simple as a sugar or salt solution; cod liver oil, known assodium morrhuate; or an herbal extract) into the area where theligaments have been weakened or damaged through injury orEFFECTIVE THERAPIES FOR CHRONIC PAIN AND RELATED PROBLEMS\n186", "strain. This stimulates proliferation of normal tissue, which helps\nthe body to repair painful areas.\nChronic musculoskeletal pain is often due to weakness of liga-\nments and tendons. The injection is given at the point where theligament or tendon connects to the bone. Many points may requireinjection. The injection causes the body to heal itself through theprocesses of controlled in\ufb02ammation and production of growthfactors.\nThe effectiveness of prolotherapy is wide ranging and includes\npain associated with the back, the neck, all joints throughout thebody, arthritis, migraine headaches, \ufb01bromyalgia, sciatica, herni-ated discs, and temporomandibular joint dysfunction (TMJ).Many chronic pain patients who did not get relief with othertreatments have improved markedly with prolotherapy. For anexcellent article on the subject by Dr. Brad Fullerton and Dr.David Harris, see the vitality101.com website under the Pain Free\n1-2-3 \u201cNotes.\u201d See Appendix B for information on how to \ufb01nd\nquali\ufb01ed physicians who have been trained in prolotherapy.\nAcupuncture (by Peter Marinakis, Ph.D.)\nThis section on acupuncture was written by Peter Marinakis,Ph.D., M.Ac., director of Full Circle Healing Arts, a multidisci-plinary well care clinic in Annapolis, Maryland, and providesdetails on how you can best use this ancient form of Chinesemedicine to treat pain.\nAcupuncture is one of the oldest, most commonly used medical\nprocedures in the world. Originating in China more than threethousand years ago, acupuncture began to become better known inthe United States in 1971, when New York Times reporter James\nReston wrote about how doctors in China had used needles to easehis abdominal pain after surgery. Research shows that acupunctureis bene\ufb01cial in treating a variety of health conditions.\nThe term acupuncture describes a family of procedures involv-\ning stimulation of anatomical points on the body by a variety ofALTERNATIVE TREATMENTS\n187", "techniques. American practices of acupuncture incorporate med-\nical traditions from China, Japan, Korea, and other countries. Theacupuncture technique that has been most studied scienti\ufb01callyinvolves penetrating the skin with thin metallic needles that aremanipulated by the hands or by electrical stimulation.\nIncreasingly, acupuncture is being used to complement con-\nventional therapies. For example, doctors may combine acupunc-ture and drugs to control surgery-related pain in their patients. Byproviding both acupuncture and conventional anesthetic drugs,doctors have found it possible to achieve a state of complete painrelief for some patients. They also have found that using acupunc-ture lowers the need for conventional painkilling drugs and thusreduces the risk of side effects for patients who take the drugs.\nCurrently, one of the main reasons Americans seek acupunc-\nture treatment is to relieve chronic pain, especially from conditionssuch as arthritis or lower back disorders, but a more complete rangeof medical conditions is listed by the World Health Organization(WHO). Some clinical studies show that acupuncture is effectivein relieving both chronic (long-lasting) and acute or sudden pain,but other research indicates that it provides no relief from chronicpain. Additional research is needed to provide de\ufb01nitive answers.\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved acu-\npuncture needles for use by licensed practitioners in 1996. TheFDA requires manufacturers of acupuncture needles to label themfor single use only. Relatively few complications from the use ofacupuncture have been reported to the FDA when one considersthe millions of people treated each year and the number of acu-puncture needles used.\nWhat the Research Says\nThe National Certi\ufb01cation Commission for Acupuncture andOriental Medicine (NCCAOM) and the Of\ufb01ce of AlternativeMedicine (OAM) have supported scienti\ufb01c research to \ufb01nd outmore about acupuncture. Researchers at the University of Mary-EFFECTIVE THERAPIES FOR CHRONIC PAIN AND RELATED PROBLEMS\n188", "land in Baltimore, with the support of OAM, conducted a ran-\ndomized controlled clinical trial and found that patients treatedwith acupuncture after dental surgery had less intense pain thanpatients who received a placebo. Scientists at the university alsofound that older people with osteoarthritis who used conventionaldrugs and acupuncture together experienced signi\ufb01cantly morepain relief than those using conventional therapy alone.\nWhat People Who Use Acupuncture Say\nThe use of acupuncture, like the use of many other complemen-tary and alternative medicine (CAM) treatments, is supported bya good deal of anecdotal evidence. Much of this evidence comesfrom people who report their own successful use of the treatment.If a treatment appears to be safe and patients report recovery fromtheir illness or condition after using it, others may decide to usethe treatment. However, scienti\ufb01c research may not support theanecdotal reports. Patient outcomes continue to be one of the bestforms of feedback to the practitioner, patient, and the health-careindustry at large. In a patient survey done by the Maryland Acu-puncture Society in January 2000, for example, 71 percent of thepatients reporting in had a \u201cvery satis\ufb01ed experience with acu-puncture and had excellent results.\u201d (See maryland-acupuncture.org for the full report.)\nLifestyle, age, physiology, and other factors combine to make\nevery person different. A treatment that works for one personmay not work for another who has the same condition. Y ou as ahealth-care consumer (especially if you have a preexisting med-ical condition) should discuss any CAM treatment, including acu-puncture, with your health-care practitioner. Do not rely on adiagnosis of disease by an acupuncture practitioner who does nothave substantial conventional medical training. If you havereceived a diagnosis from a doctor and have had little or no suc-cess using conventional medicine, however, you may wish to askyour doctor whether acupuncture might help.ALTERNATIVE TREATMENTS\n189", "How to Find a Licensed Acupuncture Practitioner\nHealth-care practitioners can be a resource for referral to practi-\ntioners of acupuncture, as more are becoming aware of this CAMtherapy. More medical doctors, including neurologists, anesthesi-ologists, and specialists in physical medicine, are becoming famil-iar with acupuncture, traditional Chinese medicine, and otherCAM therapies.\nCheck Credentials. A practitioner who is licensed and credentialed\nmay provide better care than one who is not. About forty-sevenstates have established training standards for acupuncture certi\ufb01-cation. Although proper credentials do not ensure competency,they do indicate that the practitioner has met certain standards totreat patients through the use of acupuncture.\nCheck Treatment Cost and Insurance Coverage. A practitioner\nshould inform you about the estimated number of treatmentsneeded and how much each will cost. If this information is notprovided, ask for it. Treatment may take place over a few days orfor several weeks or more. Physician acupuncturists may chargemore than nonphysician practitioners. For federal employees,physician acupuncturists are more likely to be covered. Checkwith your insurer before you start treatment as to whether acu-puncture will be covered for your condition, and if so, to whatextent. Some plans require preauthorization for acupuncture.\nCheck Treatment Procedures. Ask about the treatment procedures\nthat will be used and their likelihood of success for your condi-tion or disease. Y ou also should make certain that the practitioneruses a new set of disposable needles in a sealed package every time.The FDA requires the use of sterile, nontoxic needles that bear alabeling statement restricting their use to quali\ufb01ed practitioners.The practitioner also should swab the puncture site with alcoholor another disinfectant before inserting the needle.EFFECTIVE THERAPIES FOR CHRONIC PAIN AND RELATED PROBLEMS\n190", "During your \ufb01rst of\ufb01ce visit, the practitioner may ask you at\nlength about your health condition, lifestyle, and behavior.

Inform the acupuncturist about all treatments or medicationsyou are taking and all medical conditions you have.\nAcupuncture needles are metallic, solid, and hair-thin. People\nexperience acupuncture differently, but most feel no or minimalpain as the needles are inserted. Some people are energized bytreatment, while others feel relaxed. Improper needle placement,movement of the patient, or a defect in the needle can cause sore-ness and pain during treatment.

This is discussed in thechapters in Part I of this book. In most cases, medications simplygive symptomatic relief without eliminating the underlying causeof the pain. We began this section by discussing the natural ther-apies, as these remedies are likely to be safer, less expensive (unlessyou have prescription coverage), and have fewer side effects.

", "IV medications described in this chapter can (and should) be\nadded if needed, because it is unhealthy to be in pain. It is alsoreasonable to begin with prescription pain medications such asUltram for immediate pain relief while you\u2019re waiting for theother treatments to take effect.\nThings to Consider Before Beginning\nPain Medications\nSome medications are expensive. Most often, a generic medica-\ntion is as effective as a brand name but much less expensive. Somepatients like to get ten to thirty tablets of the brand-name med-ication \ufb01rst, so they can see what it does, and then switch to thegeneric. If there is a difference between the brand-name andgeneric medications, you would be able to tell. Unfortunately,some pharmacies are drastically marking up the cost of generics,keeping the savings for themselves. T o see what a generic med-ication really should cost, go to Costco pharmacies (or visit themonline at costco.com). They have a policy of marking up the priceto a set amount over their cost, passing the savings on to the cus-tomer. Y ou do not have to be a Costco member to use the phar-macy. If you go to one of their stores, simply tell the person at thedoor that you are going to the pharmacy.\nIn addition, most medications are much less expensive in\nhigher-dose tablets. For example, a 40 mg tablet may cost the sameas a 20 mg tablet. Y ou can save 50 percent by getting a higher-strength tablet and breaking it in half. The price of the same med-ication can also vary dramatically from pharmacy to pharmacy. Itpays to call around and check prices. An excellent mail-orderpharmacy is Consumers Discount Drug Company (phone 323-461-3606). If you can \ufb01nd a reliable Canadian pharmacy that isless expensive, you may also consider ordering from them directly.\nWhile medications are less expensive in higher-dose tablets, for\nsome medications you are likely to get more bene\ufb01t relative to theside effects at a lower dose. As you push the higher doses, you getEFFECTIVE THERAPIES FOR CHRONIC PAIN AND RELATED PROBLEMS\n194", "more side effects for less bene\ufb01t. In addition, people sometimes\nget the full bene\ufb01t without side effects at a small fraction of the\u201cstandard\u201d starting dose. Because of this, if you have a medica-tion that helps but causes side effects, try lowering the dose toeven a fraction of the starting dose. Find the dose that gives themost bene\ufb01t relative to side effects. On the other hand, somemedications do require a high dose before you see the effect.\nDoctors are often taught to give one medication, raise it to the\nmaximum tolerated dose, and then switch to another medicationif an adequate effect is not seen. They avoid combining medica-tions because of the risk of drug interactions. In treating chronicpain or insomnia, however, I have found that patients are morelikely to get excellent results with fewer side effects if they mixlow doses of several medications instead of taking a high dose ofa single medicine. As noted previously, this is because most peo-ple get more bene\ufb01t and fewer side effects at lower doses of amedication. This is especially true with medications that can besedating. Mixing medications from different categories (asdescribed later in this chapter) is more likely to help than com-bining medicines within a category. The exception is if a medica-tion greatly helps, but you cannot get an adequate dose withoutunacceptable side effects. In that situation, trying other medica-tions within the same category is a good idea.\nOther helpful things to keep in mind when taking medication\ninclude:\n\u2022Do not get pregnant while on any medication.\n\u2022Do not drive while on any medication that is sedating\nbecause you may not always be aware of the sedation.\n\u2022Some of these medications interact poorly with alcohol.\nSome people will (I think reasonably) try having a drink athome when on a steady dose of the medications to see if itcauses any reactions. Legally, I must tell you not to take anyalcohol with these medications, and check with yourphysician regarding any possible risks.PRESCRIPTION THERAPIES: WE\u2019RE WAY PAST ASPIRIN!\n195", "Why People Worry About Taking What They Need\nfor Pain\nMany people hesitate to take the amount of pain medication they\nneed because they fear side effects or addiction or because theyconsider it a sign of weakness to take medication. For those of youwho have these concerns, I would like to make several points.\nFirst, I\u2019d like to touch on an important issue regarding treat-\nment and prevention. It takes much less medication to preventpain than to make it go away once it occurs. Because of this, ifyou have chronic pain, take the medication before you expect thepain to occur, or at the \ufb01rst sign of it coming back, instead ofwaiting for the pain to be severe. Y ou\u2019ll need less pain medicineand have fewer side effects. This means that if the pain comes backevery six hours after you take the pain medicine, taking the med-icine every \ufb01ve hours\u2014even if you\u2019re not in pain when you takethe medicine\u2014may enable you to control the pain with less med-ication overall.\nThe stress of pain takes a toll on your body that is not healthy.\nPain is simply meant to tell you that there\u2019s something wrong thatyou need to pay attention to. Once you do this, the pain is nolonger healthy and should be eliminated. I suspect that you get nobonus points in heaven for having suffered through the paininstead of taking the medications needed to be comfortable. Ioften tell my patients the story about the pious man who lived inJohnstown during the Johnstown \ufb02ood. The National Guardcame into the city and told everyone to evacuate. This manrefused to leave, saying that he had faith in God and that Godwould protect him. The \ufb02oodwaters came, and soon the CoastGuard boat arrived, \ufb02oating by his second story window. Theybeseeched him to climb in the boat and be saved but he refused,once again saying that he had faith in God to protect him. Prettysoon he was up on the top of his roof, and a helicopter came byand the pilot yelled at him to get in. Once again he refused\u2014andthe man drowned. He went to heaven, and God came by. Theman was very angry at God and said, \u201cI had full faith in you andEFFECTIVE THERAPIES FOR CHRONIC PAIN AND RELATED PROBLEMS\n196", "you let me drown!\u201d God said, \u201cWhat are you talking about? I sent\nthe National Guard, the Coast Guard, and a helicopter!\u201d Themedications are like the National Guard, the Coast Guard, and thehelicopter. It\u2019s OK to use them!\nTopical Medications (Gels)\nThe use of topical delivery systems for pain medications is a majorleap forward in pain management. It allows high doses of multi-ple medications that get right to your area of pain\u2014usually withno side effects. One of the many common \u201crecipes\u201d for the paingel is the following combined in a PLO gel:\nKetamine (10 percent)\nLidocaine (15 percent)\nBaclofen (4 percent)\nAmitriptyline (2 percent)Clonidine (0.2 percent)\nKetoprofen (10 percent)\nIbuprofen (10 percent)\nRub a large pea\u2013sized amount into a silver dollar\u2013sized area at the\ncenter of a painful area three times a day. Give it two weeks towork.\nThere are over a dozen medications that can be combined in\nthese topical gels. Although they are administered by prescription,compounding pharmacists (listed in Appendix B) are usuallyhappy to guide your physician in their use.\nSome gels and creams can markedly enhance the penetration\nof medications through your skin. Medications go directly to thearea of pain in high concentrations while the rest of your body(which does not need the medication) receives very low levels.This is why side effects are usually nonexistent despite the creamsbeing highly effective. These creams need to be put together bycompounding pharmacists, who can sometimes tailor the dosingPRESCRIPTION THERAPIES: WE\u2019RE WAY PAST ASPIRIN!\n197", "to your case. Because of the time and work involved in mixing\nthese medications, most drug companies and pharmacists are notwilling to mix them.\nAlthough the creams require a prescription, many prescription\nplans will not cover them. I recommend paying for the \ufb01rst tubeof the cream yourself (approximately \ufb01fty to one hundred dollarsfor a one- to three-month supply). If it helps you and allows youto lower your dose of other pain medications, or keeps your doc-tor from having to prescribe the new very expensive medications,you\u2019ll often \ufb01nd that you can talk your insurance company intocovering the cost.\nIf you are getting bene\ufb01t from a NSAID (such as Motrin) for\ntreating a small area of pain, at least four studies have now shownthat NSAIDs can also be effective (and much safer) when used ina topical cream. In one double-blind study using a topical creamfor knee arthritis without swelling, patients rubbed a 5 percentibuprofen (Motrin) cream (containing 200 mg of ibuprofen) intothe knee three times a day. The cream started to work by thefourth day, and by the eighth day there was an average 45 per-cent decrease in pain. All patients were helped, and 40 percentconsidered the treatment to be \u201cvery good.\u201d No side effects wereseen.\nT o get an even more powerful, yet safe, effect from these\ncreams and gels, there are many medications that can be com-bined, and selecting the correct combination is an art. Some phar-macists and physicians prefer to begin with just a few medications;for example, ketoprofen (10 percent) and Flexeril (2 percent)applied three times a day locally for trigger point pain. Otherswould begin with ketoprofen (15 percent), Flexeril (3 percent),and lidocaine (5 percent). I often begin with a mixture of \ufb01ve ormore medications as this can enhance the effectiveness\u2014usuallywithout any side effects. Give the creams at least one to two weeksto work, and be willing to continue adjusting the mix until you\ufb01nd what works. The following list is just some of the medica-tions that can be added to the creams:EFFECTIVE THERAPIES FOR CHRONIC PAIN AND RELATED PROBLEMS\n198", "Ketoprofen, piroxicam, diclofenac, or ibuprofen \n(these four are NSAID anti-in\ufb02ammatories)\nNeurontin\nClonidineAmitriptyline\nCyclobenzaprine\nBaclofenKetamine (using with clonidine 0.2 percent reduces side effects)Lidocaine\nGuaifenesinCapsaicin\nCortisone and/or Sarapin\nFortunately, even though topical medications are in the \u201cbaby\nstages\u201d of development, researchers and pharmaceutical compa-nies are beginning to recognize their power. Stephen Hersh,M.D., clinical professor at George Washington University Schoolof Medicine and a member of the American Pain Society, hasfound compounded pain creams to be very helpful. For his RSD(re\ufb02ex sympathetic dystrophy) patients, he uses a combination ofgabapentin and clonidine cream, which is applied to the affectedarea two to three times a day. He notes, \u201cinstant relief [using paincreams] has not been my goal nor has it been my experience . . .unless a patient is allergic to one of the compounds in the topicalmedication, these are interventions that, unlike many in the treat-ment of chronic pain, truly do no harm.\u201d If your physician is notfamiliar with compounded pain creams, the pharmacist at CapeApothecary (T om at 410-757-3522) can help guide your physi-cian and can mail you the cream if prescribed.\nTreating with Patches\nIf you have a prescription plan, you may want to begin with thelidocaine patch. This Novocain-like patch, called Lidoderm, isapplied directly over the area of maximum pain. It can be cut toPRESCRIPTION THERAPIES: WE\u2019RE WAY PAST ASPIRIN!\n199", "\ufb01t the area, and up to four patches can be used at a time (although\nthe package insert says to use only three). It is left on for twelvehours and then removed for twelve hours each twenty-four-hourperiod, although recent reports have suggested that patches can beleft on for eighteen hours and still be safe and effective. Resultswill usually be seen within two weeks. Because the effect is local,side effects are minimal. The most common side effect is a mildskin rash from the patch. It should not be used if you have anallergy to Novocain/lidocaine.\nThe patches are most likely to be helpful if the pain is local-\nized to a moderately sized area. Even in a large area, however,patches can be used on the most uncomfortable spots. The maindownside of the patches is that they are expensive. If you haveprescription insurance, however, they will usually be covered. Isuspect that, overall, patches will be more effective than thecreams by themselves, because putting a medication \u201cunder occlu-sion\u201d (with the patch over it) drives the medication through theskin more effectively.\nOral Pain Medications\nAlthough I have organized the medications by category, it is notat all important that you understand what these categories mean.The chapters in which we discussed the different kinds of pain(neuropathic, muscular, arthritic, and so on) give the order inwhich to try the pain medications. If you are not clear on thesource or type of your pain, there are many reasonable sequencesin which to try the medications. One way to try them is in theorder of the following list. When there are several medications onthe same line, if the \ufb01rst medication helped but was not toleratedbecause of side effects, go to the next medication on the sameline. If that medication does not help signi\ufb01cantly, go to the nextline. If you get partial bene\ufb01t from a medication, continue it andadd another medication as needed to get pain free. (The medica-EFFECTIVE THERAPIES FOR CHRONIC PAIN AND RELATED PROBLEMS\n200", "tions discussed in this chapter are not a complete list of possible\nmedications, but they are the ones I have found most helpful.)\nThe main cause of side effects with many of these medications\nis raising the dose too quickly.

It\nworks on the codeine receptors and also raises serotonin and nor-epinephrine levels. Although Ultram can be taken up to 100 mgfour times a day, many people \ufb01nd they get nausea and sedation atdoses over 200 mg a day. Rarely is this a problem at a low dose,so only take 50 mg for the \ufb01rst dose. If four to six hours later nau-sea is not a problem, feel free to increase the dose to a maximumof 100 mg twice a day the \ufb01rst day. If nausea is still not a problemat this dose, you can continue to increase the dose to the maxi-mum above. The medication can also be taken on an \u201cas needed\u201dbasis.\nAspirin and NSAIDs (Nonsteroidal\nAnti-In\ufb02ammatory Drugs)\nNSAIDs block in\ufb02ammation by inhibiting hormones called\nprostaglandins (PGE). This family of hormones comes from spe-cial fats/oils in our diet (essential fatty acids). The prostaglandinthat causes in\ufb02ammation is called PGE2. This hormone is madefrom animal fats (arachadonic acid). Other oils (especially \ufb01sh oil,\ufb02axseed oil, and borage oil) make different prostaglandin hor-mones (PGE1 and PGE3) that inhibit in\ufb02ammation. In addition,these prostaglandins protect your stomach from developing ulcers.Aspirin/NSAID family medications block all of these prostaglan-dins, resulting in approximately 1 percent of chronic users peryear developing ulcers or other serious gastrointestinal complica-tions. This is why approximately \ufb01fteen thousand to twenty thou-sand Americans die each year from these medications (mostly frombleeding ulcers).\nIn fact, NSAIDs are one of the most common causes of pre-\nscription drug adverse reactions, accounting for over 107,000 hos-pitalizations and over 16,500 deaths annually in the United States.More than $2.5 billion a year is spent on the purchase of thesedrugs with another 4 billion dollars being spent to manage theirside effects. Using \ufb01sh oil and cutting down on animal fats is aEFFECTIVE THERAPIES FOR CHRONIC PAIN AND RELATED PROBLEMS\n202", "safer way to get much of these medications\u2019 bene\ufb01ts. In addition,\nwillow bark and other natural remedies (discussed in Chapter 11)have been shown to be as effective and are much safer thanNSAIDs.\nNSAIDs are rarely bene\ufb01cial in \ufb01bromyalgia (a muscle pain\ndisorder). In one study, NSAIDs were no more effective than aplacebo. There are many different categories of NSAIDs. As yourphysician is likely familiar with this family of medications, and asI am not thrilled with their being used for long-term treatmentbecause of side effects, I\u2019m not going to talk about them at greatdepth. However, let\u2019s review the key points.\nIt is important to be aware that NSAIDs can belong to differ-\nent families or chemical structures (as seen in Table 13.1), andtherefore all NSAIDs do not behave the same. If you do not getbetter with an NSAID in one family, do not try another in thesame family. Instead go to one in a different family.\nAs you can see in Table 13.1, you may not respond to ibupro-\nfen, but may respond well to Voltaren. The important thing is thatif you try ibuprofen, don\u2019t try naproxen next because you\u2019re justadding a chemically similar agent. If you use one type of NSAIDPRESCRIPTION THERAPIES: WE\u2019RE WAY PAST ASPIRIN!\n203Family/Chemical Structure NSAID\nPropionic Ibuprofen (Motrin and Advil)\nNaproxen (Naprosyn and Aleve)\nOxaprozin (Daypro) \nKetoprofen\nAcetic Diclofenac (Voltaren)\nIndomethacin (Indocin)\nTolmetin \nSulindac (Clinoral)\nSalicylic (carboxylic) Aspirin \nDi\ufb02unisal (Dolobid)\nAnthranilic (enolic) Piroxicam (Feldene)Pyrrolopyrroles Etodolac \nKetorolac (Toradol)TABLE 13.1 Families of NSAIDs", "and it does not work, change to another family altogether if you\u2019re\ngoing to try another NSAID. This applies not just to effectiveness,but also to tolerability.\nI recommend beginning with Motrin (Advil, ibuprofen) or\nDaypro, followed by Voltaren (which seems to be easier on thestomach). Although NSAIDs can be very good for in\ufb02ammatorypain, they usually work poorly for muscle/myofascial pain. Basedon its mechanism of action, one would expect that Celebrexwould not work for muscle pain either. Nonetheless, my patientshave taught me that this medication can be highly effective formuscle pain that is not helped by NSAIDs. We still have a lot tolearn.\nSelective COX-2 Inhibitors\nThese medications inhibit certain in\ufb02ammatory pathways morespeci\ufb01cally than the NSAIDs, inhibiting those COX enzymesinvolved in in\ufb02ammation, while not affecting those prostaglandinsthat protect the stomach lining. Because of this, they\u2019re consid-ered by some to be less likely to cause stomach bleeding and irri-tation. In my experience, patients have found Celebrex (100 to200 mg one to two times a day) to be far more effective for\ufb01bromyalgia and muscle pain than the NSAIDs, which only seemto help in 10 to 15 percent of patients. They are also easier on thestomach.\nIn one study conducted over a period of twelve weeks, stom-\nach ulcers were seen in 7 percent of patients given a placebo,approximately 7 percent of patients on a COX-2 medication, and29 percent of patients on Motrin (800 mg three times a day).\nUnfortunately, recent research suggests that this family of\nmedications may markedly increase the risk of heart attacks andstrokes, and because of this Vioxx and Bextra have been removedfrom the market (although in a controversial way, Vioxx was ini-tially allowed back on). In addition, they may result in high bloodpressure. Researchers at the Arthritis Research Center Founda-EFFECTIVE THERAPIES FOR CHRONIC PAIN AND RELATED PROBLEMS\n204", "tion in Wichita, Kansas, examined data on 8,538 patients who\nwere taking rofecoxib (Vioxx), celecoxib (Celebrex), or otherNSAIDs. They determined that taking Vioxx also increased therisk of lower leg swelling (a symptom often linked to hyperten-sion and other cardiac diseases) by 23 percent and increased bloodpressure by 21 percent compared to other NSAID use. Patientswho are allergic to sulfa antibiotics cannot take Celebrex.\nAcetaminophen/Tylenol\nFor many people, acetaminophen can be a safe and effective painmedication. Simply be aware that chronic use at too high a dosecan cause liver and sometimes kidney problems. Do not take morethan 4,000 mg a day, and for chronic use it is best to stay under2,000 to 3,000 mg daily. If you are taking more than 1,000 mg aday on a regular basis, you are probably depleting a critical antiox-idant called glutathione. This can result in many other problems.Taking the Energy Revitalization System vitamin powder canhelp restore your glutathione levels by supplying vitamin C, NAC(N-acetyl-cysteine), and other key amino acids. Unfortunatelytaking glutathione itself by mouth is not effective as it getsdigested. If you are taking over 1,500 mg of acetaminophen a dayon a regular basis, take an extra 500 to 650 mg of NAC each dayalong with the vitamin powder.\nA common problem is that people often take several different\nmedications that contain acetaminophen. In addition to Tylenol,it can also be found in many prescription and over-the-countercold, sleep, pain (including most narcotics), and other remedies.Please check to see how much acetaminophen is in each medica-tion you are taking so that you can be sure that you\u2019re not gettingtoxic amounts. This has become a signi\ufb01cant concern with analarming number of patients suffering from serious side effectsassociated with accidental overdosing of acetaminophen. Thisresults in over \ufb01fty-six thousand hospital emergency room visitsand one hundred deaths a year according to the FDA. This risk isPRESCRIPTION THERAPIES: WE\u2019RE WAY PAST ASPIRIN!\n205", "especially alarming when you realize that acetaminophen is only\nmodestly superior to a placebo for treating arthritis. At higherdoses of acetaminophen (over 2,000 mg a day), the risk of gas-trointestinal bleeding increases 3.6 fold. At doses of over3,600 mg, the risk was equivalent to that of aspirin and NSAIDs.In addition, kidney failure and death from liver failure was morecommon in people taking acetaminophen for pain than in thosewho overdosed.\nAlthough I consider acetaminophen to be an excellent drug for\nshort-term or intermittent use, especially at doses under 2,000 mga day, other medications may be safer for long-term and chronicuse\u2014and will likely be more effective.\nMuscle Relaxants\nSome muscle relaxants work directly on the brain, causing lessmuscle weakness. One excellent medication is Skelaxin (800 mgthree to four times a day), which is low in side effects. In somepeople it works wonderfully, and in others it does nothing. Formuscle pain, give Skelaxin a few weeks to see the effect. This is amedication I use frequently because it is not sedating.\nOther medications work directly on the muscles to cause\nrelaxation instead of working at the level of brain or nerve func-tion. Because of this, they are also not likely to cause sedation orconfusion, but they are more likely to cause muscle weakness.\nOne such medication is dantrolene (Dantrium), which works\ndirectly on the muscle causing it to relax. The usual dose is 25 to100 mg given three to four times daily. The main problem withusing this medication is that it can cause liver damage in about1 percent of patients who use it, and liver blood tests may need tobe monitored.\nGABA-Augmenting Medications\nGABA is a chemical compound in the brain that tends to settledown excess stimulation. Historically, GABA-augmenting med-ications have been used to treat muscle spasm. The medicationEFFECTIVE THERAPIES FOR CHRONIC PAIN AND RELATED PROBLEMS\n206", "Baclofen has been used for almost forty years and has been found\nto be safe and effective and is considered a key \ufb01rst-line therapyfor spasticity.\nUnlike some medications, Baclofen can be used over a wide\nrange of dosing. Although a common dose is 10 to 20 mg two tofour times a day, doses as low as 5 mg or as high as 200 mg a daycan be used. Its main limiting side effects are sedation and, athigher doses, muscle weakness. In addition, withdrawal spasmsand other side effects can be seen if the medication is stoppedabruptly. Because of this, if you have been on Baclofen for anextended time and you want to stop, you should be weaned offthe medication slowly. This medication may also be helpful forpost-traumatic stress disorder. In addition, I found that newermedications that affect GABA are more effective than Baclofenand work on many different kinds of pain\nNeurontin (Gabapentin). This seizure medication can help a wide\nvariety of pain patients. Although Neurontin is related to theGABA neurotransmitters, how it works is unclear. It does stimu-late GABA receptors in ways that are different from Baclofen.Although it causes sedation and other neurologic side effects insome patients, overall it is very safe and well-tolerated. It has beenproven to be effective in both diabetic neuropathy and posther-petic neuralgia (shingles pain).\nBegin with 300 mg at bedtime. Patients who are very sensitive\nto medications should begin with only 100 mg. If tolerated, youcan increase the dose to 600 mg the second night and 900 mg thethird night. Y ou can then increase the Neurontin dose by 300 mgonce or twice weekly (or more quickly if side effects are not aproblem). When taking over 900 mg a day, divide the totalamount into three daily doses. If there is no effect at 2,400 mg aday, the medication is not likely to help. If you have been on themedication for more than a few months, it should be tapered offover several weeks. Although it is rare, withdrawal can occur ifthis medication is stopped suddenly. If only partial relief is seen atPRESCRIPTION THERAPIES: WE\u2019RE WAY PAST ASPIRIN!\n207", "2,400 mg a day, the dose can be raised as high as 4,800 mg or\nmore daily. The medication may not be absorbed as effectively iftaken within a few hours of magnesium (or aluminum antacids).Therefore, if it\u2019s convenient, take the vitamin powder, whichcontains magnesium, a few hours away from the Neurontin dose.\nGabitril. As noted in Chapter 4, Gabitril (tiagabine) is an anti-\nseizure medication that has also been shown to increase GABA byinhibiting reuptake (the same way that Prozac raises serotonin).Although not FDA approved for sleep, studies have found that, inaddition to decreasing pain, the medication can also improve deepsleep. The main side effects are sedation, dizziness, irritability, andgastric upset. It is best to take Gabitril with food. The most com-mon effective dose of Gabitril is 16 mg a day (ranging from 5 to24 mg a day).\nIn one study, Gabitril was given at a dose of 2 mg twice a day\nand increased by up to 4 mg daily each week to a maximum of24 mg a day. Other patients received Neurontin, beginning at100 mg twice daily and increasing by 300 mg a day each week toa maximum of 2,400 mg a day. The ninety-one patients partici-pating all had chronic pain of different types. Gabitril decreasedpain by approximately 30 percent and decreased sleep problemsby approximately 40 percent. Similar albeit smaller improvementswere seen with Neurontin. Especially important is the \ufb01ndingthat the amount of time spent in deep, restorative sleep wasincreased. Five mg at bedtime is a good sleep dose.\nLyrica (Pregabalin). This drug is related to Neurontin and is the\n\ufb01rst drug that may eventually have FDA approval for use in\ufb01bromyalgia, so insurers will more likely pay for it. It may alsobe approved for epilepsy, neuropathic pain, and anxiety. A mul-ticenter drug study showed that pregabalin was helpful with bothcontrolling pain and increasing deep sleep in patients with \ufb01bro-myalgia. It also reduced restless leg syndrome, a very commonEFFECTIVE THERAPIES FOR CHRONIC PAIN AND RELATED PROBLEMS\n208", "problem in \ufb01bromyalgia. The main side effects are dizziness and\ndrowsiness, which tend to decrease over time. Initial experiencewith it has been very encouraging. The dosing range is 50 to150 mg three times a day. A dose of 100 mg three times a daymay be as effective as the higher dose.\nTopamax (Topiramate). This is another antiseizure medication that\ncan be very helpful for pain. Although I use T opamax infre-quently, this is a medication that I have seen work wonderfully inpatients for whom numerous other treatments have failed, and itsometimes starts working in less than one week. Begin with 25 to50 mg daily and increase by 25 to 50 mg a week until you get thedesired effect. This medication is usually given twice a day at atotal daily dose of 50 to 100 mg per day for migraines and 200 to300 mg a day for nerve pain, although lower doses can be effec-tive. If you get side effects, decrease the dose and perhaps laterincrease it more slowly until you get the desired effect.\nThe most common side effects are diarrhea (11 percent), loss\nof appetite (11 percent), sedation (10 percent), and nausea (10 per-cent). The side effects often go away after two to three months.Along with pain relief, T opamax also has the bene\ufb01t of causingweight loss. Besides sedation, its most worrisome, albeit unusual,side effect is that it can make your body very acidic\u2014to the pointwhere it is dangerous. Because of this, it is reasonable to check ablood bicarbonate level every so often (especially if you startdeveloping symptoms such as fatigue) and make sure that the levelis over 17.\nAntidepressants\nAntidepressants can be very helpful in alleviating pain even if theperson is not depressed. Do not presume that your pain specialistthinks that you have a psychological problem if you\u2019re offered anantidepressant for pain. The following types of antidepressantshave been found useful in alleviating pain.PRESCRIPTION THERAPIES: WE\u2019RE WAY PAST ASPIRIN!\n209", "Tricyclic Antidepressants. These medications (including Elavil/\namitriptyline, doxepin, and others) can be dramatically bene\ufb01cial,even at very low doses, for neuropathic pain. They also improvethe sleep problems caused by the pain. Where the antidepressantdose of Elavil is approximately 200 to 250 mg a day, the neuro-pathic dose is usually about 10 to 50 mg at bedtime. In additionto neuropathic pain, tricyclic antidepressants have also been foundto be effective for \ufb01bromyalgia. Tricyclics have also been foundto be effective for headaches and vulvodynia/pelvic pain syn-dromes. They also can markedly enhance the effect of narcoticpain medications.\nTheir main side effects include dry mouth, sedation, weight\ngain, constipation, low blood pressure, and palpitations. In addi-tion, these medications can cause a worsening of glaucoma, uri-nary retention, and restless leg syndrome.\nDesipramine (Norpramin), 25 to 150 mg at bedtime, or nor-\ntriptyline (Pamelor), 10 to 25 mg at bedtime, cause less sedationand fewer side effects than Elavil and may be as effective. If seda-tion is still a problem, consider switching to doxepin (10 to 40 mgat bedtime).\nFlexeril (Cyclobenzaprine). While Flexeril is a muscle relaxant, it\nis in the tricyclic family. Unlike Elavil, which is more effective fornerve pain, Flexeril is mostly effective for muscle pain and sleepproblems. In my experience, it is better tolerated than Elavil andis worth trying even if the other tricyclics were ineffective orpoorly tolerated. In one \ufb01bromyalgia study, Flexeril was far moreeffective than a placebo.\nFlexeril can be sedating, and many people choose only to take\nit at night, using 10 to 20 mg at bedtime. It can also be taken at adose of 5 to 10 mg three times a day instead. Recent studies havefound, however, that a 5 mg dose is almost as effective as 10 mgwith much less drowsiness. In one study of patients with musclespasm, most patients experienced moderate to c omplete symptom\nrelief within forty-eight hours of starting Flexeril (5 mg threeEFFECTIVE THERAPIES FOR CHRONIC PAIN AND RELATED PROBLEMS\n210", "times a day). Only 29 percent were sedated at the lower dose, and\nin most cases sedation was mild, with only 2 percent of patientsreporting severe sedation. As an aside, the generic form is muchless expensive. If it is not available in the 5 mg generic size, sim-ply get the 10 mg tablet and break it in half.\nSSRI Antidepressants. SSRIs include medications such as Prozac,\nEffexor, and Celexa and can also be highly effective for pain.These medications raise serotonin, which lowers levels of sub-stance P , a major pain messenger. Substance P levels can beincreased by 300 percent in the brains of patients with \ufb01bromyal-gia, and it is elevated in other pain states as well. One-third of\ufb01bromyalgia patients \ufb01nd that SSRIs help their pain signi\ufb01cantly.Interestingly, people may feel horrible with one SSRI and won-derful with another, so it is worth trying several sequentially to\ufb01nd one that \u201c\ufb01ts.\u201d\nBeing off-patent, Prozac has the bene\ufb01t of being less expensive.\nCelexa causes fewer side effects than other antidepressants. In myexperience however, Effexor is the most effective antidepressantfor decreasing the pain and other symptoms of \ufb01bromyalgiapatients, so it is a reasonable medication to try \ufb01rst. This may occurbecause the medication raises both serotonin and norepineph-rine\u2014an excellent combination in pain management. Effexor canbe helpful in neuropathic pain and headache as well, especially inpatients with associated depression and/or anxiety.\nDr. Argo, a pain specialist at the pain management center at\nColumbia Rose Medical Center, Denver, has found that Paxil canbe very helpful for re\ufb02ex sympathetic dystrophy where otherSSRIs are not.\nA new family of antidepressant medications is promising.\nCymbalta (duloxetine) is a norepinephrine and serotonin reuptakeinhibitor. At lower doses (20 to 60 mg a day), it has fewer sideeffects and does not cause weight gain.\nIf sleep is a problem, consider adding trazodone (Desyrel) at\nbedtime. This novel antidepressant is very good for sleep (use aPRESCRIPTION THERAPIES: WE\u2019RE WAY PAST ASPIRIN!\n211", "low dose such as 25 to 75 mg at bedtime) and anxiety. As noted\nin previous chapters, good sleep is critical for pain relief!\nOne of the most troublesome side effects of the Prozac family\n(SSRI) antidepressants is sexual dysfunction (discussed in moredetail in Chapter 14). This especially manifests as delayed orgasm.As one of my female patients said, \u201cAn orgasm delayed is anorgasm lost.\u201d Many treatments are available to help with this typeof sexual dysfunction. I recommend beginning with the herbginkgo biloba, 120 mg two times daily. This higher dose is nec-essary to counteract the loss of libido from antidepressants, as theusual dose (60 mg twice daily) was not effective in a recent study.It takes six weeks to see the effect on the libido.\nMedications that can be helpful for antidepressant-induced sex-\nual dysfunction include cyproheptadine (Periactin), 2 to 16 mgdaily, average dose 8 mg. It can be taken one to two hours beforeintercourse on an \u201cas needed\u201d basis, or it can be taken every day.Its main side effect is sedation, and it will sometimes reverse theeffectiveness of the antidepressant, so taking it on an \u201cas needed\u201dbasis may be the best approach. BuSpar (buspirone), a medicationused to treat anxiety, has also been shown to help. It is best takenevery day when used for sexual dysfunction. Stimulants such asDexedrine and Ritalin, 5 to 25 mg daily, are also effective. Othermedications that raise dopamine, such as amantadine (Symmetrel),100 mg twice daily, or the antidepressant Wellbutrin, have alsobeen shown to be effective. Although most of the studies on thesemedications were conducted in a small number of patients (exceptfor ginkgo biloba, which was a larger trial), there are plenty ofoptions available so that you can have your Prozac and your sexlife too!\nAlpha-2-Adrenergic Agonists (Enhancers)\nZana\ufb02ex (tizanidine) and Catapres are two key medications in thecategory of alpha-2-adrenergic enhancers. The former appears tobe more effective for pain management and has fewer side effects.Like GABA agents, these medications tend to settle things down.EFFECTIVE THERAPIES FOR CHRONIC PAIN AND RELATED PROBLEMS\n212", "Unlike Baclofen, however, Catapres has the bene\ufb01t of not caus-\ning muscle weakness.\nThe main side effect of Zana\ufb02ex is sedation, but this can also\nbe a bene\ufb01t. In most patients, I recommend that they take 2 to8 mg at bedtime. This helps sleep and also helps both nighttimeand next-day pain. Dry mouth is sometimes seen with this med-ication. If sedation is not a problem, Zana\ufb02ex can be taken threeto four times a day as needed, with a maximum dose of 36 mg aday. Most patients \ufb01nd that 4 mg at bedtime works just \ufb01ne. IfZana\ufb02ex is too expensive, try Catapres instead.\nNMDA Receptor Antagonists\nNMDA receptors are highly involved in triggering pain and cancause irritation that results in the persistence of pain. Because ofthis, medications that settle down this NMDA irritation can bevery helpful.\nKetamine. Ketamine is a general anesthetic that has traditionally\nbeen given intravenously. Because ketamine works by blocking acritical pain mechanism (the NMDA receptor) that is missed byother therapies, it holds promise in the treatment of refractorypain, especially neuropathic, myofascial, posta mputation, and\nre\ufb02ex sympathetic dystrophy. Ketamine has been used clinicallyfor over twenty-\ufb01ve years for anesthesia. In addition, pain reliefoften persists long after the medication has worn off. This sug-gests that ketamine may actually be breaking the pain cycle (whenthe pain itself triggers more pain) in some conditions.\nIn the later section on IV therapies, I brie\ufb02y discuss the role of\nIV ketamine, an anesthetic that can cause hallucinations and a feel-ing of unreality, limiting its use on a regular basis. Nonetheless, itcan be very helpful in certain refractory cases\u2014especially withnerve/neuropathic pain and re\ufb02ex sympathetic dystrophy. Sideeffects tend to decrease with continued use and can be decreasedby adding other medications such as Haldol or midazolam (or byadding 0.2 percent Catapres to ketamine creams when needed).PRESCRIPTION THERAPIES: WE\u2019RE WAY PAST ASPIRIN!\n213", "Because of IV and oral ketamine\u2019s psychological side effects,\nthese forms of ketamine are best prescribed by those physicianswho have more experience with pain management. Ketamine canbe very helpful (and usually side effect free) in gel form applied tothe painful area, taking one to two weeks to see the effect.\nKlonopin (Clonazepam). Klonopin is in the Valium family, but I\n\ufb01nd it to be much more effective and safer than Valium for a num-ber of reasons. Klonopin acts as an NMDA receptor antagonist. Italso acts as a muscle relaxant and can be very helpful for sleep(unlike Valium, which actually interferes with restorative sleep,keeping people in light stage 2 sleep). However, like Valium,Klonopin can be addictive. In my experience, addiction has beenrare at doses under 1.5 mg a day. Its main side effect is sedation,so I mostly have patients take it at nighttime. It can also be veryhelpful for anxiety and restless leg syndrome (where your legs arerhythmically moving all night\u2014and your sleep is not very restfulif you\u2019re running a marathon all night).\nPatients often come to my of\ufb01ce who have been on benzodi-\nazepines (Valium family medications) for many years and are oftenaddicted. If the medication is not interfering with their life and ishelping their symptoms, I do not consider getting them off themedication to be a high priority. For those who want to wean offValium family medications, it must be done under a physician\u2019ssupervision as withdrawal is common. Neurontin (200 mg threetimes a day) can help make it easier to wean off Valium and otherrelated medications.\nDextromethorphan. Dextromethorphan is not usually very effec-\ntive on its own in treating pain, but when added to narcotics ithelps to keep the narcotics effective. Only a small percentage of\ufb01bromyalgia patients (less than 18 percent), however, received sig-ni\ufb01cant bene\ufb01t from the dextromethorphan (a 51 percentdecrease in pain at an average dose of 50 mg, three times a day).EFFECTIVE THERAPIES FOR CHRONIC PAIN AND RELATED PROBLEMS\n214", "For most patients, the side effects\u2014dizziness, mental fog, nausea,\nand fatigue\u2014at these doses are prohibitive. But if you have per-sistent pain, dextromethorphan is worth trying by starting at 25to 50 mg a day and slowly increasing the dose as tolerated.Although this medication is available over the counter, it is usu-ally found mixed with other medications. It can be obtained inpure form from compounding pharmacists.\nSodium Channel Blockers\nExcept for lidocaine, this family of medications tends to be highin side effects. Because of this, I usually use other medications\ufb01rst. Nonetheless, in some patients these medications can be agodsend. (Lidocaine is discussed in the later section on IV painmedications.)\nDilantin (Phenytoin). Dilantin is one of the oldest seizure medica-\ntions and is underused. I was amazed about twenty years agowhen I received a book on the uses of Dilantin in the mail. A mil-lionaire was given Dilantin for a severe chronic problem withalmost miraculous results. He researched the little-publicized ben-e\ufb01ts of Dilantin use, put them in a book, and sent a free copy ofthe book to every physician in the country. Since he derived nobene\ufb01t except helping others from this expensive action, I wasimpressed enough to explore the use of this medication further.Although it is old and fairly inexpensive, Dilantin can be veryhelpful. It is useful for nerve pain of several types, including timeswhen cancer is in\ufb01ltrating into nerve bundles. The recommendeddose is 300 to 400 mg daily.\nDilantin does have more side effects than most of the other\nmedications we\u2019ve discussed, and, therefore, I rarely use it as a\ufb01rst-line treatment, saving it for cases that do not respond to othertherapies.\nDilantin can also cause birth defects if one gets pregnant while\ntaking it. Otherwise, its main side effects include dizziness, seda-PRESCRIPTION THERAPIES: WE\u2019RE WAY PAST ASPIRIN!\n215", "tion, and nausea. It can also cause unwanted hair growth (some-\ntimes on the ears in females) and overgrowth of gum tissue. (Thelatter side effect can actually be bene\ufb01cial in those who havereceding gums. Dilantin can be given as a topical cream appliedto the gums for this purpose.)\nTegretol (Carbamazepine). This antiseizure medication is most\noften used for trigeminal neuralgia, peripheral neuropathy, andpostherpetic neuralgia (post shingles pain). The main side effectsinclude sedation, tremor, and dif\ufb01culty with speech. A drop inwhite blood cell count can occur in 10 percent of patients, butthis sometimes resolves after four months. If blood counts go toolow or there is lymph node enlargement, stop the medication.This medication can also cause birth defects if one gets pregnantwhile taking it. It has many more side effects than most of theothers that I use, and therefore I rarely use it.\nAdditional Oral Medications\nLamictal (lamotrigine) can also be effective for many kinds ofpain, including nerve pain from AIDS and central brain pain fromstrokes. In early studies where lower doses of 200 mg a day or lesswere used, the effects were marginal. Doses of 200 to 400 mg aday, divided through the day, are more effective for some kinds ofpain. Y ou can start with a low dose and increase by 25 mg a weekto decrease the probability of side effects. The most worrisomeside effect is a rare rash (called Stevens-Johnson syndrome), whichcan be fatal. If you develop a rash, stop the medication immedi-ately and let your doctor know. The vast majority of the time itwill not be this dangerous type of rash, but better safe than sorry.\nKeppra (levetiracetam) is another new antiseizure medication\nthat we are just starting to explore. It has been effective whenother treatments have not helped. The recommended dose is 500to 1,500 mg twice daily.\nTrileptal (oxcarbazepine) is a cousin to the medication T egre-\ntol, and both of these medications are helpful for trigeminal neu-EFFECTIVE THERAPIES FOR CHRONIC PAIN AND RELATED PROBLEMS\n216", "ralgia. The dose is 150 mg two times a day, although one can go\nas high as 600 mg two times a day. The side effects (sedation,blurred vision) decrease after the initial three weeks of treatment.\nLithium is a natural mineral that is available by prescription for\nthe treatment of bipolar disorder (manic-depressive illness). It hasmany other properties including being antiviral. Interestingly, sev-eral case reports have noted that debilitating chronic pain that hasbeen refractory to other treatments will sometimes improve dra-matically with lithium. Sometimes this can be achieved withdoses as low as 300 mg one to two times daily.\nWhen to Consider Narcotics\nSome physicians consider narcotics to be a pain reliever of lastresort\u2014only to be used with terminally ill cancer patients. Theuse of narcotics for chronic pain continues to be controversial andhas become highly politicized. Fortunately, the vast majority ofchronic pain cases can now be treated effectively without nar-cotics. Nonetheless, there are cases in which they are necessary.Sometimes the toxicity of the pain dramatically outweighs thetoxicity of the medication.\nIf narcotic side effects are problematic, ask your doctor to use\nthe other pain medications we discuss in the book as well so youcan \ufb01nd a combination that is more comfortable. (Using fentanylpatches can be very helpful because they give steady release ofpain medication, are powerful, and can be taken even if nausea orconfusion is present.)\nData suggest that longer-acting narcotics are less likely to cause\naddictive behavior than short-acting narcotics. In addition, as pre-viously mentioned, for severe chronic pain, giving the medicationon a regular basis (two to three times a day) to prevent pain ismore effective than waiting for the pain to occur before takingthe medication\u2014with the result that less medication is needed.\nWhen treating with narcotics, it is helpful to be aware that dif-\nferent narcotics can work on several different types of opioidPRESCRIPTION THERAPIES: WE\u2019RE WAY PAST ASPIRIN!\n217", "receptors. This means that combining different narcotics may\nresult in their having a synergistic effect (a lower dose of two dif-ferent types such as oxycodone and morphine may work muchbetter than a higher dose of one of them). In addition, if one isdeveloping resistance to one narcotic, rotating to others may resultin improved effectiveness. Some narcotics also have multipleeffects. For example, methadone affects the opioids receptorswhile also blocking NMDA receptors.\nDealing with the Side Effects\nThe main side effects of narcotics are constipation and sedation.The magnesium in the vitamin powder can be very helpful for theconstipation, and other treatments can also help. I recommendusing the following list as many other constipation treatments canbe addictive. Adjust as needed for one soft bowel movement a day.\n\u2022Increase water, \ufb01ber (for example, eat one bowl of whole\ngrain cereal in the morning), and magnesium intake.\n\u2022Try other natural over-the-counter treatments for\nconstipation that include high-dose vitamin C (see thearticle \u201cVitamin C Flush\u201d under \u201cUseful Articles\u201d atvitality101.com), prunes, and/or prune juice. Although weoften forget about prunes, they have been used for centuriesand can be quite helpful.\n\u2022Prescription treatments can also help and include MiraLax\u2014\ntake one heaping tablespoon a day in eight ounces of water;sorbitol (70 percent)\u2014take one to three teaspoons threetimes a day as needed; and lactulose liquid as needed.\nA new medication called Provigil can be very helpful for\nnarcotic-induced fatigue. Aricept (donepezil), a medication forAlzheimer\u2019s disease that increases acetylcholine levels, has alsobeen found to be helpful for this problem.\nI would note that there is also a small subset (approximately 2\nto 5 percent) of \ufb01bromyalgia patients who experience dramaticclearing of exhaustion and fatigue (associated with their pain)EFFECTIVE THERAPIES FOR CHRONIC PAIN AND RELATED PROBLEMS\n218", "with narcotic pain medications. They state (and I\u2019ve heard this\nstatement many times) that they \u201cfeel like healthy normal humanbeings\u201d when they are taking the narcotic medication. AlthoughI have not yet \ufb01gured out the biochemistry of this effect, in thefuture I hope to have nonnarcotic alternatives that will give thesame bene\ufb01t.\nAnother important side effect of using opioids in men is that\nthe narcotics will routinely drop the patients\u2019 testosterone levels(often by elevating a hormone called prolactin), resulting in lossof libido and sometimes dif\ufb01culty with erections. Because of this,it is reasonable to have a patient\u2019s testosterone level checked beforebeginning chronic opioids. If symptoms of low testosteroneoccur, and the testosterone level has decreased on treatment withopioids, it is reasonable to treat with natural testosterone cream orAndroGel as well.\nLong-Acting Narcotic Pain Medications\nThere are a number of different long-acting narcotic pain med-ications. These include methadone (Dolophine), sustained-releasemorphine (such as MS Contin), and sustained-release oxycodone(OxyContin), which may be preferable to short-acting combina-tions of codeine with acetaminophen, oxycodone, or hydroco-done. The longer-acting medications maintain a steady blood levelso there is less of a euphoric effect (and therefore less drug crav-ing) and more consistent relief of pain. In addition, not combin-ing the medication with acetaminophen allows one to safely usehigher doses, as needed. Using more than 3,000 to 4,000 mg ofacetaminophen (Tylenol) daily can be toxic to the liver andimmune system (as explained previously).\nMethadone is one of the oldest narcotics and has many bene-\n\ufb01ts. It is inexpensive, long-acting, effective, and usually well-tolerated. It also may have some activity as an NMDA receptorantagonist, making the medication useful in neuropathic pain aswell. Unfortunately, I do not use methadone in my practicedespite its being an excellent pain medication. The regulatory andbureaucratic risks and hassles associated with its use are simplyPRESCRIPTION THERAPIES: WE\u2019RE WAY PAST ASPIRIN!\n219", "too great. This has also been the experience of many other pain\nspecialists.\nFortunately, there are other longer-acting narcotics available.\nOne of the best known is OxyContin (timed-release oxycodone),which can be very safe and effective when used orally as directed.Sadly, it can be illegally diverted and used illicitly. Therefore, ithas also become dangerous for physicians to prescribe Oxycontin,even appropriately, because the federal government will some-times put a physician in jail for doing so. OxyContin also has beenassociated with vitamin B\n2(ribo\ufb02avin) de\ufb01ciency, which will\nsometimes cause the corners of the mouth to crack. This is calledangular stomatitis ,cheilitis , or perleche . In one study of twenty-two\npatients receiving OxyContin, twenty of them were found tohave this problem. High-dose vitamin B\n2(present in the Energy\nRevitalization System) eliminated the problem in almost allpatients within a few days.\nAn alternative is the use of timed-release morphine. This can\nbe given every twelve hours, although in some patients it needs tobe given three times a day. Another alternative is non\u2013timed-release oxycodone (Percocet and Roxicet), which is stronger andless sedating than morphine. Although not as safe (they are moreaddictive) as the timed-release form (Oxycontin), they\u2019re stillhighly effective, and physicians are less likely to be arrested or losetheir licenses for prescribing them. Again, be aware that many ofthese medications are combined with acetaminophen (Tylenol)and that many pain patients are getting acetaminophen from manysources. It is worth repeating that chronic use of more than 3,000to 4,000 mg of acetaminophen a day can cause severe liver dam-age. It is very important to check everything that you are takingto make sure that you do not take more than this amount of acet-aminophen daily.\nNarcotics and Addiction\nExperience and the scienti\ufb01c literature have shown that opioidsare very unlikely to cause addiction when used properly for treat-EFFECTIVE THERAPIES FOR CHRONIC PAIN AND RELATED PROBLEMS\n220", "PRESCRIPTION THERAPIES: WE\u2019RE WAY PAST ASPIRIN!\nThe medical components found in marijuana (discussed in Chapter\n11) can be helpful in a number of painful conditions, especially\nwhen anxiety and/or loss of appetite (for example due to cancer)\nare also problematic. In most studies, pharmaceutical fractions arestudied (such as THC in the medication Marinol) instead of whole\nmarijuana. Studies have found marijuana to be effective for cancer,\nneuropathic, and spasticity pain. Unfortunately, as discussed earlier,the more expensive synthetic pharmaceutical forms of marijuanamay not be as effective as smoking marijuana.\nCurrent evidence suggests that there are brain receptors for\ncannabis just as there are receptors for opioids, and that migraineheadaches, \ufb01bromyalgia, and irritable bowel syndrome may all\ndisplay an underlying de\ufb01ciency of the body\u2019s own \u201ccannabis-like\u201d\nchemical production. Especially in cases where the brain has beensensitized to pain (called a central sensitization state with\nsecondary hyperalgesia) such as occurs in \ufb01bromyalgia, the data\nsuggest that cannabis therapies could be helpful. Unfortunately,the politics surrounding drug policy precludes these treatmentsfrom currently being used\u2014despite their being safer, more\neffective, and certainly less expensive than many other treatments.Cannabinoids\n221ment of pain. Addiction needs to be contrasted to a physical\ndependence and tolerance. Addiction is an uncontrolled compul-sive use of the drug even though it is harming the user. Clinicalexperience and medical literature suggest that this is a veryuncommon situation when opioids are used for chronic pain innon\u2013drug addicts. Habituation and physical dependence, however,are common with this family of medication as well as with anti-depressants, antiseizure medications, and many other medications.All this means is that you do not want to stop the medication sud-denly, as you might go through withdrawal. Instead, the medica-tion should be tapered off over time. Physical dependence does", "not usually become a problem in the clinical setting unless the\nmedication is stopped suddenly or the dose is reduced substantiallywithout tapering it.\nIn addition and as noted previously, Dr. Argo, a pain specialist\nat the pain management center at Columbia Rose Medical Cen-ter, Denver, has found that adding low-dose Elavil can markedlyenhance the effect of narcotic pain medications. In addition, tak-ing dextromethorphan (25 mg two times a day) can decrease thetolerance that people develop to a narcotic\u2019s effectiveness. Becauseof this, it is reasonable that anyone on narcotic pain medicationsshould also take dextromethorphan.\nIntravenous Pain Medications\nIn severe cases of persistent pain, the use of intravenous pain ther-apies can be powerfully effective. Anytime IV pain medicationsare used, it is worth giving intravenous nutritional support at thesame time. This can contribute powerfully to healing the under-lying problem, and a series of these treatments can help you feelbetter and may actually eliminate the source of the pain. These IVnutritional therapies are called Myers cocktails and are currentlybeing studied in a placebo-controlled trial.\nMagnesium\nIn a study of eighty-six patients with chronic muscle pain, includ-ing myofascial pain and \ufb01bromyalgia, a series of injections with IVor IM (intramuscular) magnesium with other nutrients, includingB vitamins, calcium, and vitamin C, was given. Seventy-four per-cent of the patients improved, with 64 percent requiring four orless injections to see optimal results. Some patients required long-term treatments to maintain the effect. Side effects leading to dis-continuation of therapy occurred in 4 percent of the patients. Theneed for prescriptions for anti-in\ufb02ammatory medications and mus-cle relaxants was decreased markedly. In addition (as noted inEFFECTIVE THERAPIES FOR CHRONIC PAIN AND RELATED PROBLEMS\n222", "Chapter 7), intravenous magnesium has also been shown to be\nvery helpful for acute migraine headaches.\nLidocaine\nA second highly effective intravenous pain therapy is the use oflidocaine. I have found this to be very effective in a large numberof patients with widespread pain. In my practice, I give a 60 mgtest dose during a time period of approximately forty-\ufb01ve min-utes. This is to screen for patients whose blood pressure tends todrop or who have other side effects. If the initial treatment iswell-tolerated, an additional 40 to 60 mg can be given the \ufb01rst day(this low dose is unlikely to result in much pain relief ). Forfollow-up treatments, I usually give 75 mg of lidocaine over atime period of approximately twenty minutes, followed by 2 mgper minute (120 mg per hour) for a total of 200 to 300 mg. Thiscan be repeated once or twice a week as needed, and pain relieftends to be more sustained after the \ufb01rst three to six treatments.\nUsing this treatment approach without heart monitoring is\ncontroversial because there\u2019s a possible risk of abnormal heartrhythms with lidocaine use. These abnormal rhythms occur pre-dominantly in patients who are in intensive care units for acuteheart attacks. I have never seen heart rhythm problems and do notuse monitoring because this can increase the patient\u2019s cost fromeighty to seven hundred dollars per dose. One study using high-dose lidocaine (up to approximately 500 mg per day over six hoursfor six days) showed marked pain improvement, but two of thepatients did have cardiac side effects that were transient but sig-ni\ufb01cant. This suggests that caution be used when administeringlidocaine in patients with heart problems.\nKetamine\nOther studies have also found IV ketamine (at a dose of 0.3 mgper kilogram over one half hour) to be helpful. Because of thesometimes uncomfortable spaciness/mental changes that can occurPRESCRIPTION THERAPIES: WE\u2019RE WAY PAST ASPIRIN!\n223", "during the IV infusion, IV ketamine is used less often than lido-\ncaine. Its main promise may be in the treatment of those withre\ufb02ex sympathetic dystrophy/regional c omplex pain syndrome\nand others with severe refractory pain (discussed in Chapter 4).Despite the intoxicated/dissociative feelings that can routinelyoccur with ketamine in higher dosing, it can be powerfully effec-tive in very dif\ufb01cult pain syndromes. Any uncomfortable (mostoften they are not) psychological side effects of ketamine can bedecreased by giving the patient Klonopin and having the patientsleep right after the injection.\nPrescription Sleep Medications\nAlthough I much prefer natural remedies to prescription medica-tions, the sleep disorder in some pain patients may be too severeto be dealt with by natural remedies alone. The medicationsdescribed in this section can help you get a full night\u2019s sleep.\nPrescription Sleep Aids\nFor all of the medications discussed here, most of the side effectsthat you may notice will occur the \ufb01rst day that you take the med-ication. Do not drive or operate hazardous equipment if you aresedated from the medications. As with almost everything, do nottake these medications if you are or are trying to get pregnant.Although in my experience it is very uncommon, it is possible toget unusual reactions from combining these medications. If amedication causes recurring nightmares, change the dose or themedication.\nAmbien (Zolpidem). I like Ambien because it is short-acting (that\nis, less likely to leave you hungover) and less likely to cause sideeffects than many other medications. Because it is short-acting, itmay not keep you asleep all through the night, but it will likelygive you four to six hours of good, solid sleep as a foundation. TheEFFECTIVE THERAPIES FOR CHRONIC PAIN AND RELATED PROBLEMS\n224", "normal dosage is one-half to one 10 mg tablet, taken at bedtime.\nIf you wake up in the middle of the night you can take an extrahalf to one tablet, and any sedation is usually gone by the time youare ready to wake up in the morning. One-half tablet is usuallyenough for the middle of the night. If you \ufb01nd that taking an addi-tional dose in the middle of the night leaves you hungover, switchto the new, sustained-release form, or use Sonata (described a fewsections later) when you wake instead.\nStudies have not shown a wearing-off effect with Ambien in\nmost people, nor have they found addiction with long-term use.What does occur, though, is rebound insomnia when you stopusing this medication\u2014that is, the need to use something else toassist your sleep for a week. Because of this, if you have takenAmbien for more than four months, use one of the other med-ications or natural sleep remedies discussed in this chapter for aweek or so to assist sleep during the time when you stop theAmbien. In my experience, Ambien can be helpful for restless legsyndrome as well.\nAlthough the use of Ambien is only FDA recommended for\nless than a month, a two-year study of four thousand patients withchronic insomnia showed that people were able to use it long termwhenever they needed it without developing any signi\ufb01cant prob-lems. Regardless of the package insert saying to only use Ambienfor a maximum of one month, both research studies and the expe-rience of many clinicians show that it can be used safely longterm. Rarely, I have seen patients develop depression after beingon Ambien for over a year. In these cases, the depression hasalways lifted quickly within a few days of stopping the Ambien.\nKlonopin (Clonazepam). Although in the Valium family, and\ntherefore potentially habit-forming, Klonopin can be very help-ful for people with pain and is excellent for patients with restlessleg syndrome. When used at doses of less than 2 mg a night, I havenot seen signi\ufb01cant problems with addiction. The main side effectPRESCRIPTION THERAPIES: WE\u2019RE WAY PAST ASPIRIN!\n225", "is next-day sedation, which is fairly common. If this occurs, take\na lower dose or take it several hours before bedtime. Because it ispotentially habituating (for example, it may cause withdrawal ifstopped abruptly), do not suddenly stop taking Klonopin if youhave been on it for over six weeks. Instead, taper off by decreas-ing the dosage by 0.25 to 0.5 mg a day every one to eight weeks.\nSonata (Zaleplon). Sonata (in 10 mg capsules) generally wears off\nwithin three to four hours, so it is best used in the middle of thenight (for example, at 4:00 a.m.) if you wake up and need some-\nthing to help you fall back to sleep, or if you have trouble fallingasleep but not staying asleep.\nLunesta (Eszopiclone). Taking 1 to 3 mg at bedtime can be mod-\nestly effective with few side effects. Oddly though, a third of peo-ple taking it get a funny taste.\nMuscle Relaxants That Help with Sleep\nFlexeril (cyclobenzaprine) is a muscle relaxant that can be a veryhelpful medication for many people, especially if the pain issevere. The usual dose is one-half to one 10 mg tablet at bedtime,but some people need to take two tablets at bedtime. The mainside effects are sedation and dry mouth and eyes.\nSoma (carisprodol) is predominantly a muscle relaxant, and I\nwould use this earlier in treatment if you are being kept awake bysevere pain. The usual dose is one-half to two 350 mg tablets atbedtime. Soma is potentially addictive, although I have almostnever seen withdrawal in patients who are only using one to twotablets at bedtime (as opposed to people taking it four times a dayfor pain). The main side effect is sedation.\nMedications That Help Both Pain and Sleep\nNeurontin (gabapentin) taken at bedtime can markedly help withboth sleep and pain in many patients. Y ou can take one to threeEFFECTIVE THERAPIES FOR CHRONIC PAIN AND RELATED PROBLEMS\n226", "capsules of 300 mg (though it also comes in 100 to 800 mg doses).\nIts main problem is next-day sedation, which often wears off withtime. It can also be taken during the day for pain relief at doses ofup to 4,800 mg daily.\nZana\ufb02ex (tizanidine) taken at bedtime can also be helpful for\nboth pain and sleep; the usual dosage is one-half to two 4 mgtablets. However, it rarely causes nightmares, so if this occursrepeatedly, stop the Zana\ufb02ex.\nGabitril (tiagabine) helps both pain and deep sleep. For sleep,\n2 to 8 mg at bedtime is a reasonable dose. In one study, Gabitrildecreased pain by approximately 30 percent and decreased sleepproblems by approximately 40 percent. Another bene\ufb01t is that theamount of time spent in deep, restorative sleep is increased.\nAntidepressants That Can Help with Sleep\nIn addition to the prescription medications previously mentioned,the serotonin-raising antidepressants known as SSRIs can helpimprove sleep. They also have many other bene\ufb01ts in treatingpain\u2014even if there is no depression present. These medicationsinclude Prozac (\ufb02uoxetine), Paxil (paroxetine), and Zoloft (ser-traline) and can improve sleep after six weeks.\nElavil (amitriptyline), technically an antidepressant, was one\nof the \ufb01rst medications to be studied for \ufb01bromyalgia and foundto be effective. It is also the only medication that many doctorshave heard of for treating \ufb01bromyalgia. Although Elavil can bevery helpful, it has signi\ufb01cant side effects and therefore is oftenone of the last treatments I try. These side effects include weightgain, dry mouth, sedation, aggravation of restless leg syndrome,neurally mediated hypotension, and abnormal heart rhythms. Itis, however, especially good for nerve pain, vulvadynia (pain inthe vulvar area), and, perhaps, interstitial cystitis characterized bysevere urinary frequency and burning without infection (seeChapter 9). If these are present, it is reasonable to start withElavil or a related medication. Y ou can take one-half to eightPRESCRIPTION THERAPIES: WE\u2019RE WAY PAST ASPIRIN!\n227", "10 mg tablets at bedtime. If you take more than two tablets, it\nshould be tapered off and not stopped suddenly. I would not usemore than 80 mg at bedtime (unless you have to) because of theside effects.\nDesyrel (trazodone) in high doses is marketed as an antide-\npressant, but at a low dose it is excellent for sleep and anxiety.Desyrel comes in 50 to 450 mg tablets, and the usual recommen-dation is to take one-half to six of the 50 mg tablets at bedtime(most patients need no more than two tablets). The main sideeffect of Desyrel is next-day sedation, and priapism can occur inmales. Priapism is a condition characterized by a painful erectionthat does not go away. This is unusual. Most men \ufb01nd that whileit causes an improvement in the strength of their erections, it doesso at a comfortable level, as opposed to an erection that will notgo away after a normal amount of time. If you develop an erec-tion that does not go away after an hour (despite a cold bath), stoptaking the medication and go to a hospital emergency room. Iferections are lasting longer than normal, you should stop theDesyrel and switch to the other medications.\nAdditional Medications for Sleep\nXanax (alprazolam) is a short-acting cousin of Valium that givesa good three to \ufb01ve hours of sleep with less hangover in themorning. I was pleasantly surprised to \ufb01nd that Xanax improvessleep quality because Valium usually seems to worsen this in mostpeople. Xanax is very good for anxiety as well and tends to bevery well tolerated; however, it can be addictive. The usualdosage is one-half to four 0.5 mg tablets at bedtime or during thenight.\nGHB (Xyrem) is an excellent (and possibly the best) sleep\nmedication for pain and \ufb01bromyalgia. However, because the DEAclaimed (many suspect mistakenly) that it was being used as a daterape drug, it has gone from being inexpensive and available overthe counter to being tightly regulated and costing approximatelyEFFECTIVE THERAPIES FOR CHRONIC PAIN AND RELATED PROBLEMS\n228", "\ufb01ve hundred dollars a month. If all else fails, Xyrem often works\nvery well. It comes as a liquid that can dissolve your enamel anddamage your teeth, however, so be sure to rinse your mouth welland swallow after taking the liquid to prevent this. Physiciansmust \ufb01ll out special forms when prescribing Xyrem.\nBenadryl (or doxylamine) is a common antihistamine that may\nalso help pain. The usual dose is 25 mg at night.\nCombining Sleep Aids for an Optimal Effect\nThere are several approaches to sleep when treating pain patients.Some doctors prefer to use a single medication or treatment andpush it up to its maximum level. If that works, great; if not, theystop it and switch to another medication. Other doctors prefer touse low doses of many different treatments together until thepatient is getting good, solid sleep regularly. I strongly prefer thelatter approach. Most of a medication\u2019s bene\ufb01ts occur at low doses,and most of the side effects at high doses. In addition, if you com-bine low doses of a few different sleep aids, each of them will becleared out of your body by morning\u2014so you won\u2019t be hungover.Meanwhile, the effective blood levels that you have during themiddle of the night from each treatment are cumulative and willkeep you asleep for eight to nine hours of solid sleep each nightwithout waking or hangover. If you\u2019re not sleeping eight to ninehours a night without waking, let your physician know so yourmedications can be adjusted.\nAs I mentioned earlier and depending on your preference, you\nmay want to start with the natural aids (for example, taking theRevitalizing Sleep Formula herbal remedy plus calcium and mag-nesium at bedtime), see how those work, and then use the pre-scription ones as needed. My preference is to start with at leastone of the sleep medications (Ambien and/or Klonopin) com-bined with some of the natural remedies. Ambien, Klonopin,Xanax, and Soma are considered potentially addictive, but in thedose and form that I use, this is rarely a problem. If you havePRESCRIPTION THERAPIES: WE\u2019RE WAY PAST ASPIRIN!\n229", "next-day sedation, try taking the medications (except for Sonata\nand Ambien) a few hours before bedtime. However you chooseto do it, on the \ufb01rst night begin with one of the remedies at a lowdose.\nFor most of the treatments recommended, by the next morn-\ning you will know the effects that it is going to have. It may, how-ever, take six to twelve weeks to see the full effect of 5-HTP andvalerian. In rare cases, some of these treatments have the oppositeof their normal effect, activating you instead of putting you tosleep. If this happens, don\u2019t use that treatment.\nOnce you have tried a low dose of a single treatment, increase\nthe dosage each night until you either get eight to nine hours ofsolid sleep without waking or feeling hungover, you get sideeffects (for example, next-day sedation), or you are at the maxi-mum dose recommended. Use the lowest dose that gives you themost bene\ufb01t. In other words, you may \ufb01nd that 50 mg of Desyrelis just as effective as 150 mg, in which case there is no need totake the higher dose. Once you have tried one treatment, you cango ahead and add in a second one in the way I just discussed, andthen a third one, and so on. Y ou may choose to initially try eachof them separately so you can see what each one does by itself, oryou may choose to simply add one treatment to the next. Basically,you are trying the treatments on to see what \u201c\ufb01ts,\u201d in the sameway you would try on shoes to see which pair feels the best. Onceyou have found the combination of treatments that feels the best,you can simply stay on that combination.\nWhy One Medication Doesn\u2019t Fit All\nIt is interesting to note that patients with \ufb01bromyalgia and otherpain syndromes often respond well to one medication but notanother that works by a different mechanism. Which treatmentswork varies from person to person. This demonstrates that thereis not a single cause to many pain problems. This is why lookingEFFECTIVE THERAPIES FOR CHRONIC PAIN AND RELATED PROBLEMS\n230", "for the single \u201cmagic bullet\u201d approach to pain management does\nnot work as well as the \u201ctry a combination of therapies until yousee what works\u201d approach (known as integrative or comprehen-sive medicine). Of course, this approach works better if you havemore options to choose from than only Tylenol or Motrin/aspirinfamily medications!PRESCRIPTION THERAPIES: WE\u2019RE WAY PAST ASPIRIN!\n231", "This page intentionally left blank ", "Sexual Dysfunction,\nDepression, and\nMind-Body Aspects\nof Pain\nThere are many additional problems that result from chronic pain\nand often can be interrelated. For example, depression, pain, andanxiety may cause loss of self-esteem and associated loss of libidoin both men and women. In addition, narcotic therapies and thechronic stress of pain itself can lead to decreased production ofmany hormones including testosterone.\nDealing with Loss of Libido and/or\nSexual Function\nLoss of libido and/or sexual function can occur from any of the\nmultiple problems that are common in chronic pain. In our studyof patients with \ufb01bromyalgia, 73 percent had loss of libido. Lossof sexual function in \ufb01bromyalgia was also found in a study con-ducted in Brazil. Sexual dissatisfaction was present in 55 percentof patients, with 74 percent of women having pain with inter-\n233CHAPTER14\nCopyright \u00a9 200 6 by Jacob  Teitelbaum .

Because of this, checking testosterone levels isappropriate in anyone, male or female, with sexual dysfunction\u2014especially in the presence of chronic pain. When treating for lowtestosterone, I strongly recommend that natural testosterone be usedinstead of synthetics. In men, testosterone 1 percent (Androgel) canbe applied to the skin over the shoulders and abdomen twice dailyfor a total daily dose of 25 to 100 mg. T estosterone cream can alsobe made less expensively by compounding pharmacists. T estos-terone tablets should not be used in men because the high dose canresult in elevated cholesterol levels when taken by mouth.\nIn men with low or low-normal testosterone who also had\nangina, high cholesterol, and/or diabetes, repeated studies haveshown decreased angina, cholesterol, and diabetes with the addi-tion of natural testosterone. Sadly, these data have been largelyignored. I bring my patients\u2019 testosterone blood levels up to themid to upper part of the normal range.\nT estosterone can also help loss of libido in women. For exam-\nple, a recent study has demonstrated that small doses of testos-terone may improve the sex lives of women who have hadhysterectomies. Delivered transdermally (via the skin) by a patchapplied twice a week, the testosterone raised desire and improvedfunction in 74 percent of the study participants. Even if you havenot had a hysterectomy, a trial of testosterone is reasonable if yourfree testosterone level (use the results of the free testosteroneblood test, not the total testosterone) is in the lowest quarter ofthe normal range. In women, 2 to 6 mg of testosterone in creamor tablet form daily is usually adequate and can help pain, libido,and overall well-being.\nOther factors also contribute to sexual dysfunction. These\ninclude pain caused from assuming sexual positions or marital stressfrom chronic pain. Antidepressants such as Prozac commonly causeEFFECTIVE THERAPIES FOR CHRONIC PAIN AND RELATED PROBLEMS\n234", "dif\ufb01culties with erections, decreased libido, and dif\ufb01culty with\nachieving orgasm (the latter being especially important in women).\nIf you need to continue the antidepressants, the associated sex-\nual dysfunction is treatable. One study showed that taking the herbginkgo biloba 120 mg twice daily often eliminated the sexual dys-function caused by antidepressants after six weeks (a lower dose wasnot as effective). Wellbutrin, trazodone, or Remeron do not seemto cause the sexual dysfunction caused by other antidepressants.\nMedications for Sexual Dysfunction\nI recommend using Viagra or Cialis for erectile dysfunction. Via-gra can be taken in doses of 25, 50, or 100 mg tablets. It is mosteffective when taken on an empty stomach, and the higher doseis often effective if the lower dose is not. In addition, it is gener-ally cheaper to buy a 100 mg tablet and break it in half than to buytwo 50 mg tablets. Cialis is a newer medication for erectile dys-function. It may work faster than Viagra (within ten to \ufb01fteenminutes), and the effects last for more than twenty-four hours. Itcomes in 10 and 20 mg strengths and can be taken with food.Neither medication should be used in conjunction with nitro-glycerin, and they may cause problems in patients with heart dis-ease. A newer medication that may not have this problem (calledvardena\ufb01l) is being developed.\nNatural Remedies for Treating \nSexual Dysfunction\nAt the 2004 meeting of the American Psychiatric Association,\nresearchers from Columbia University reported on the growinguse of complementary medicines to boost sexual function anddesire. The herb rhodiola, for example, may reduce prematureejaculation and boost sexual desire in both men and women. Rho-diola also seems to revive sexual energy, provide increased pleas-ure, improve erections, and intensify orgasms, allowing for moresatisfying sex. The presentation also discussed the effectiveness ofSEXUAL DYSFUNCTION, DEPRESSION, AND MIND-BODY ASPECTS OF PAIN\n235", "the herbs ginseng, ginkgo, maca, and horny goat weed in restor-\ning sexual desire and function in both men and women.\nPain, Anxiety, and Depression\nChronic pain, anxiety, and depression have long been linked, andpatients with chronic pain suffer a high incidence of majordepressive disorders (MDD). Thomas Elliott of St. Mary\u2019s DuluthClinic Health System set out to further characterize this link bylooking for correlations among age, sex, chronic pain, and depres-sion. He found that the prevalence of MDD was signi\ufb01cantlyhigher in younger patients with chronic pain\u201459 percent in theeighteen to forty-four years age group. Furthermore, 70 percentof women with chronic pain also suffered MDD, a signi\ufb01cantlyhigher percentage than the men in this sample. It is understand-able that anyone with a severe illness, especially one that is treatedas poorly as pain, would go through periods of depression. Y ouare not alone. With new treatments, however, you \ufb01nally have theopportunity to become pain free\u2014which is a great start at treat-ing depression!\nIt is OK to acknowledge that chronic pain devastates people\u2019s\nlives in many ways. It can dramatically worsen the quality of yourlife on many levels, including physical, social, emotional, and spir-itual. It can trigger depression, anxiety, and loss of independence.It also can severely interfere with your ability to work and main-tain friendships and relationships. All of these issues need to beaddressed and supported.\nPeople with chronic pain, however, are often afraid to bring up\nthese problems with their family, friends, and physicians. Althoughit may be appropriate not to continually bring up one\u2019s pain in per-sonal relationships, since you may \ufb01nd yourself getting tuned outand avoided, it is important that your doctor be made aware of per-sistent pain at each visit. Research has shown that patients are oftenhesitant to bring up their pain during doctor visits for the follow-ing reasons: they\u2019re afraid of being viewed as c omplainers, they areEFFECTIVE THERAPIES FOR CHRONIC PAIN AND RELATED PROBLEMS\n236", "concerned about distracting the doctor from other medical issues,\nor they have a fatalistic view that nothing can be done.\nIt is important to recognize that it is not OK to be left in\nchronic pain. Y ou need to make your doctor aware of your situa-tion if the pain is persistent and not adequately controlled. If yourphysician is not able or willing to take further measures to help,ask for a referral to a pain specialist (or another one if you arealready seeing one). If your doctor does not believe that anotherphysician may have any other options for you, let him or herknow about the options discussed in this book, or go ahead andget a second opinion on your own.\nNatural Remedies for Depression and Anxiety\nDepression can often be effectively treated using natural therapies.I recommend beginning by making sure that you have adequatelevels of most nutrients, particularly B vitamins (especially B \u2081\u2082and\nfolate). The easiest way to do this is with the Energy Revitaliza-tion System powder, which also dramatically raises levels ofSAM-e\u2014another nutrient highly effective against depression.Many studies show that SAM-e is as (or more) effective at treat-ing depression than tricyclics, without the side effects. Unfortu-nately, SAM-e tablets are not very stable, are very expensive, andrequire a high dose. Because of this, the vitamin powder is likelythe best approach. I recommend also adding \ufb01sh oil (one-half toone tablespoon per day) to your regimen. Several studies haveshown \ufb01sh oil to be very helpful in treating depression.\nSaint-John\u2019s-wort, 1,000 to 2,000 mg daily, is the next thing I\nwould add. Dozens of studies have found it to be as effective asprescription antidepressants for treating moderate depression. Likemost prescriptions, it is unlikely to be effective by itself for severedepression, although limited data suggest that higher doses mightbe effective. Do not combine it with prescription antidepressantsunless cleared by your doctor because the combination can (very,very rarely) drive serotonin levels dangerously high. In my prac-tice, I may combine Saint-John\u2019s-wort with prescription antide-SEXUAL DYSFUNCTION, DEPRESSION, AND MIND-BODY ASPECTS OF PAIN\n237", "pressants, because this allows for a lower dose of the antidepressant\nmedication and therefore fewer side effects.\n5-HTP , the nutrient that your body uses to make serotonin,\ncan also be helpful for both depression and pain. It also has thebene\ufb01t of improving sleep and causing weight loss. The usual doseis 200 to 400 mg at bedtime. As with Saint-John\u2019s-wort, it raisesserotonin levels, so limit the dose to 200 mg a day if taking it withantidepressants. Combining 5-HTP with the amino acid tyrosine\ncan make it even more effective.\nThe mineral rubidium, 500 mg daily with food, can also help\neven resistant depression. It takes one month to work and is avail-able without a prescription from compounding pharmacies. Instudies of the mineral, participants used between 180 to 720 mgdaily. Some minor side effects include constipation, diarrhea,insomnia, or agitation (do not use it if you have manic-depressiveillness/bipolar disorder). It is a good idea to eat a banana a day ortake a glass of V8 juice each day along with the rubidium.\nMagnolia delivers a double whammy. The herb magnolia is\nrich in honokiol and magnolol, which have numerous health ben-e\ufb01ts, especially their ability to alleviate both depression andstress\u2014without making you sleepy! See the website smart-publications.com/articles/040331magnolia.htm for more informationon this excellent herb.\nFor anxiety, high-dose vitamin B \u2081(thiamine) at 250 to 500 mg\nthree times a day and/or theanine, 50 to 300 mg a day, can have awonderfully calming effect, which continues to dramaticallyincrease over time when it is used regularly for two to six weeks.\nThere are two excellent products that contain many of the\nabove natural therapies and much more. For anxiety, I would takethe Calming Balance Formula, and for depression I recommendHappiness 1-2-3. Take one to three capsules of either (or both)three times a day. Although some bene\ufb01t is seen immediately, theeffectiveness increases markedly over two to six weeks, and mypatients love these products (see Appendix B).EFFECTIVE THERAPIES FOR CHRONIC PAIN AND RELATED PROBLEMS\n238", "Lifestyle Changes That Can Help with Depression\nOther commonsense approaches to treating depression are also\nvery important. Walking, for example, has been shown to be aseffective as Prozac in treating depression. Bright light exposureduring the wintertime, yoga and tai chi, spiritual healing, andother similar modalities can also be very helpful. Most important,it is essential that you get in touch with, and express, your feel-ings. My book Three Steps to Happiness: Healing Through Joy! is a\nshort book that will teach you how to do this (available online atvitality101.com).\nPain: The Mind-Body Connection\nEmotional stress can also contribute to pain. John Sarno, M.D., isa professor of clinical rehabilitation medicine at New Y ork Uni-versity School of Medicine and an attending physician at the RuskInstitute of Rehabilitation Medicine at New Y ork UniversityMedical Center. He found that the mind often decreases the blood\ufb02ow to areas of the body in an attempt to distract us from uncom-fortable emotions by causing pain. This occurs even though thepain is often hundreds of times more uncomfortable than the feel-ing our mind is trying to protect us from. Fortunately, although thepain caused by decreased blood \ufb02ow is real and can be severe, itgenerally does no permanent harm.\nThis concept may seem odd at \ufb01rst, but it gives us a powerful,\nsimple, safe, natural, and inexpensive way to eliminate many kindsof pains\u2014especially when we combine this knowledge with thephysical treatments. This approach is quite simple, and I \ufb01nd thatit works best for localized pain such as back pain, tendonitis, andlocalized nerve pain.\nAs noted, your mind may be decreasing blood \ufb02ow to muscles\nand other areas to distract you from uncomfortable emotional feel-ings or at other times because you are \u201cburying\u201d these feelings inyour muscles. When you feel pain, tell your mind that you willSEXUAL DYSFUNCTION, DEPRESSION, AND MIND-BODY ASPECTS OF PAIN\n239", "repeatedly use the pain as a signal to look for and feel those uncom-\nfortable emotions for ten to \ufb01fteen minutes\u2014then do so. The painwill often leave within six weeks. Interestingly, this works welleven for pain that began after an injury. For more informationabout this approach, read Dr. Sarno\u2019s books Healing Back Pain: The\nMind Body Connection and The Mind Body Prescription .\nDr. Sarno theorizes that what is actually causing pain is not the\nherniated disc, or some other structural condition, but a conditionof mild oxygen deprivation that is brought about by the brain sim-ply altering the blood \ufb02ow to a particular area. This mild oxygendeprivation is what causes pain in muscles, nerves, and tendonsanywhere in the body. He calls this tension myositis syndrome\n(TMS). He feels the problem is not based on in\ufb02ammation butrather a decreased oxygen supply. He theorizes that this is whytreatments that increase local circulation, such as deep heat in theform of ultrasound, deep massage, and active exercise can tem-porarily decrease pain.\nDr. Sarno explains that x-ray and MRI studies \ufb01nd normal\nchanges in the area of the pain that are unrelated to the pain. Hegives an example published in a 1994 research paper by MaureenJensen and colleagues in the New England Journal of Medicine .\nThey performed MRIs on about ninety-eight people who had nohistory of back pain. The researchers found normal discs in only36 percent of the people. Everyone else had bulges (herniations)of various kinds and yet no pain. That\u2019s the kind of informationthat doctors in this country totally ignore.\nEmotional Factors Associated with Pain\nDr. Sarno came to many of the same conclusions about the psy-chodynamic of pain that I discuss in my book From Fatigued to\nFantastic! The difference is that he feels that the pains come\nentirely from the psyche without a physical cause (other than theself-induced decreased blood \ufb02ow).

This cycleof repression and lack of focus on what feels good can result inmany illnesses, including pain.\nIn addition to pain coming from decreased blood \ufb02ow to the\nmuscles, pain can also come from muscles being stuck in the short-ened position. In addition to the biochemical triggers that we havediscussed earlier in this book, this can occur in response to emo-tional stresses where we tighten our muscles as a form of \u201cemo-tional armor.\u201d It can also occur in response to other physicalinjuries. The body will often tighten the muscles in the area ofinjury to form a kind of a splint. This helps to decrease pain ini-tially, but can then add to pain in the long run.\nAnother critical point to remember is that we are only aware\nof less than 3 to 5 percent of the sensory input that comes into ourbrains at any given time. The rest is \ufb01ltered out. For example, takea moment to notice the sounds of your heating/cooling system,the buzzing of the lights, the feeling of the air on your skin, andthe numerous other sensations that you do not notice until some-body points them out. Pain is a fairly loud sensory input becauseit is meant to get our attention. It does so to tell us many things.We are familiar with the messages to avoid something traumatic,like our hand being on a hot stove, or to pay attention to and takecare of, an injury\u2014and we heed these messages fairly well. Weare now also aware of some of the less overt but equally impor-tant needs of our bodies that pain informs us of. These include thephysical needs of nutritional support, sleep, hormonal support, andeliminating infections. But the root causes of pain also include theSEXUAL DYSFUNCTION, DEPRESSION, AND MIND-BODY ASPECTS OF PAIN\n241", "psychological, and perhaps even the spiritual, needs to be true to\nourselves, acknowledge our feelings, and to do what feels best tous. This may not always be what other people are expecting of usor telling us to do. Simply attending to these issues will eliminatemany pains.\nIn other situations, there may be a malfunction in the pain sys-\ntem itself. Once your psyche knows that you have \ufb01nally attendedto those things you needed to pay attention to, a remarkable thingcan happen. Y our brain\u2019s \u201c\ufb01ltering system\u201d is now able to recog-nize that the pain signal is no longer important, and it can start to\ufb01lter the signal out as it does other sensory input presented to it.This process of muting your pain signal can be helped by themany pain treatments we\u2019ve discussed in this book. At this pointa fairly remarkable thing occurs. Y ou\u2019ll \ufb01nd that your chronic painbecomes intermittent, then mild, then gone!EFFECTIVE THERAPIES FOR CHRONIC PAIN AND RELATED PROBLEMS\n242", "", "Eliminating\nWeight Gain\nThis chapter is derived from an article on weight gain in pain-\nrelated illnesses that I wrote for a magazine. I think you will \ufb01ndit interesting, and it will also serve as a helpful overview of manyof the things we have discussed in the book.\nWeight gain can be a major problem in chronic pain and chronic\nstress states. For example, our study of \ufb01bromyalgia patients showedan average weight gain of thirty-two pounds. It\u2019s bad enough to feelawful and be in chronic pain, and the blow that many people feel totheir physical self-image from the weight gain can add further suf-fering. Why is weight gain such a problem? For starters, we live ina society where being overweight is epidemic. It is much easier tolose weight and keep it off, however, when you understand thatthere are many things that contribute to this problem. Most of usare familiar with the more common ones.\n\u2022The standard American diet (SAD). Our standard diet\ncontains excessive sugar and fat. In addition, food processing\ncauses the loss of many vitamins and minerals, resulting in\u201chigh calorie malnutrition.\u201d It is quite possible that this isthe \ufb01rst time in the history of the human race that this has\n243CHAPTER15\nCopyright \u00a9 200 6 by Jacob  Teitelbaum . Click here for terms of use.  ", "occurred! Being nutritionally de\ufb01cient in numerous vitamins\nand minerals is one of many causes of excessive foodcravings. Unfortunately, it is hard to get adequate nutritionout of the American diet, even if one\u2019s diet is relativelyhealthy.\n\u2022Lack of exercise. During most of human history, people\nhad to walk if they wanted to get somewhere. In addition,work often consisted of physical labor. This is no longer thecase. In fact, we often even get upset if we can\u2019t get aparking space right near the entrance of the mall!\nFor many people, simply altering their diet and increasing their\nexercise is enough to let them lose weight. A large percentage ofchronic pain sufferers, however, have found that it is impossibleto lose weight and keep it off no matter what they do.\nWhy Chronic Pain Makes It So Dif\ufb01cult to \nLose Weight and Keep It Off\nThere are a number of ways that stress, \ufb01bromyalgia, and/or\nchronic pain can contribute to your inability to lose weight. For-tunately, understanding these can help you overcome this problem.Both physical stresses (pain, infections, nutritional de\ufb01ciencies,toxic chemical exposures) and emotional/situational stresses (hav-ing a toxic boss, working too hard without enough sleep, worry-ing) can result in a metabolic chain reaction that results in weightgain. Chronic fatigue syndrome and \ufb01bromyalgia (CFS/FMS) aregood models for the occurrence of weight gain during stress andchronic pain.\nHow CFS/FMS Causes Weight Gain\nAs noted in Chapter 6, I do not view these syndromes as theenemy. Rather, I see them as attempts by the body to protect itselffrom further harm and damage in the face of excess energyEFFECTIVE THERAPIES FOR CHRONIC PAIN AND RELATED PROBLEMS\n244", "demands. A simple way to look at \ufb01bromyalgia and CFS is to view\nthem as circuit breakers. In a house, when certain systems areoverstressed, some of the circuit breakers will go off to preventdamage to the home\u2019s wiring. In CFS and \ufb01bromyalgia, the hypo-thalamus acts as a \u201ccircuit breaker\u201d going into hibernation in theface of excess stress. In the body, under normal circumstances, bysupplying proper rest and nutrition, the circuit breakers can comeback on and systems can return to healthy functioning. In CFS/FMS, however, it is as if the main circuit breaker (in this situationit\u2019s the hypothalamus\u2014a master gland in the brain) has \u201cblown.\u201dWhen this occurs, rest is no longer enough to restore properfunctioning.\nDespite the many diverse stresses that can cause these syn-\ndromes, most patients\u2019 symptoms seem to come from a commonendpoint\u2014dysfunction or suppression of the hypothalamus. Thisgland controls sleep, hormonal function, temperature regulation,and the autonomic nervous system (including blood pressure,blood \ufb02ow, and movement of food through the bowel). This iswhy these patients can\u2019t sleep, have low body temperatures, andbecause poor sleep causes immune dysfunction, are prone to mul-tiple and recurrent infections. The hypothalamic dysfunction byitself can cause most of these symptoms. In addition, I suspect thatproblems with the mitoc hondria (the \u201cenergy furnac es\u201d in the\ncells) are also present and are what cause hypothalamic suppression.\nThis process contributes to weight gain in several ways. The\nexpression \u201cgetting your beauty sleep\u201d has a basis in fact. Deepsleep is a major trigger for growth hormone production. Growthhormone stimulates production of muscle (which burns fat) andimproves insulin sensitivity (which decreases the tendency tomake fat). Getting the eight to nine hours of sleep a night that thehuman body is meant to have can powerfully contribute to yourstaying young and trim!\nThe other two main triggers for growth hormone production\nare exercise and sex. In fact, one study showed that people whoELIMINATING WEIGHT GAIN\n245", "have sex at least three times a week look ten years younger than\nthose who don\u2019t. The study notes that this was because of theincrease in growth hormone release.\nHow Stress and Hormones Contribute to Weight Gain\nAs noted in Chapter 2, the hypothalamic \u201ccircuit breaker\u201d thatgets suppressed with stress also controls the hormone system. Thisresults in inadequate levels of thyroid hormone (which acts as ourbody\u2019s gas pedal and burns calories) and adrenal hormone. Thesymptoms of hypothyroidism include weight gain as well asfatigue, cold intolerance, achiness, and poor mental function.\nThe adrenal gland is the body\u2019s stress handler. As discussed in\nChapter 2, when we are under stress our \u201c\ufb01ght or \ufb02ight reaction,\u201dmay be set off many times a day with little time in between torecover. This can result in exhaustion of the adrenal gland. As itis the job of the adrenal gland to maintain blood sugar levels intime of stress by making cortisol, people initially have elevatedcortisol levels, which results in weight gain.\nOver time, adrenal exhaustion occurs that can result in epi-\nsodes of hypoglycemia (low blood sugar). Unfortunately, peoplecrave sugar and eat more than they normally would when they gethypoglycemic. This leads to further weight gain, which can occurparadoxically whether your cortisol levels are too high or too low.Whether your cortisol is high or low, treating the overall processthat is causing your pain lowers the stress on your body and canhelp you lose weight.\nAdditional Factors That Lead to Weight Gain\nClinical experience has shown that fungal (also known as candidaor yeast) overgrowth (see Chapter 3) contributes powerfully toboth sugar cravings and weight gain. Although doctors do notknow the mechanism for this, we have repeatedly seen excessweight drop off once this overgrowth is treated and eliminated.The good news is that treating yeast overgrowth will not just helpEFFECTIVE THERAPIES FOR CHRONIC PAIN AND RELATED PROBLEMS\n246", "you to lose weight but can also help eliminate your spastic colon\nand sinusitis.\nHow to Lose Weight and Feel Better\nT o lose weight, cut down on sugar and simple carbohydrates (suchas potatoes, bread, and pasta) and increase your water intake. Wesometimes confuse thirst with hunger, and this leaves us eatingmore than we really want.\nNot to sound like a broken record here, but getting optimum\nnutritional support helps pain and also helps prevent weight gain.When you are de\ufb01cient in vitamins or minerals your body cravesmore food than you need, and your metabolism will be sluggish.T o keep it simple and avoid the need to take tablets all day, I rec-ommend that you use the Energy Revitalization System (see Chap-ter 2 and Appendix B). In addition, acetyl-L-carnitine 500 mgtwice a day can be very helpful as well.\nAgain, not to keep repeating myself, but to keep weight down,\nit\u2019s essential to get eight to nine hours of solid sleep a night. If youhave insomnia, herbals can help. I recommend Revitalizing SleepFormula, one to four capsules, one hour before bedtime. This is amix of six herbals and is the most effective natural sleep aid avail-able. (See Chapter 11 and Appendix B.)\nGetting exercise is also a key. Find something that is fun and\nfeels good. It also helps to have a regularly scheduled exercise timethree to four times a week in which you meet a friend to exercisewith. Otherwise, human nature is to make excuses not to show up!\nHaving even a few of the symptoms of hypothyroidism is\nenough to justify a therapeutic trial of thyroid hormone, whichmay help to counteract weight gain. If you are overweight, tired,and have cold intolerance or achiness, ask your holistic doctor fora prescription of Armour Thyroid. Adjust it to the dose that feelsbest while keeping the free T4 blood test in the normal range (seeChapter 2).ELIMINATING WEIGHT GAIN\n247", "Pay attention to adrenal stress support, as both elevated and low\nadrenal cortisol levels can cause weight gain. Start by making anattitude change. Whenever you notice that you\u2019re getting anxiousor worried, ask yourself the simple question, \u201cAm I in imminentdanger?\u201d The answer is almost always no, and you\u2019ll \ufb01nd that youradrenal glands relax as you realize this. If you have problems withrelaxing or letting go of worry, my new book Three Steps to Hap-\npiness: Healing Through Joy can help you get from where you are to\na life that you love (available online at vitality101.com). If you areexperiencing hypoglycemic episodes, consider taking an adrenalglandular. I recommend Adrenal Stress End, one to two capsuleseach morning as needed (available online at vitality101.com).\nIf you have chronic sinusitis or spastic colon, there is a good\nchance you have fungal/yeast overgrowth in your bowels. Avoidsugar (stevia is a great substitute\u2014the best tasting one is by BodyEcology). Take Acidophilus Pearls (healthy milk bacteria to com-bat yeast), two pearls twice a day (see vitality101.com for sources).If you have a holistic physician, ask for a prescription for nystatinand Di\ufb02ucan antifungals (see Chapter 3).\nIt is no longer necessary to be on an extreme, unsustainable, or\nunhealthy diet to lose weight and keep it off. The preceding rec-ommendations will not just help you stay trim, but they will leaveyou healthy and full of vitality as well.\nManaging Medications That Affect Weight Gain\nand Loss\nMany medications contribute to weight gain. Lithium, for exam-\nple, has been associated with average weight gains of eight to thir-teen pounds. This is similar to the amount of weight gainassociated with taking Depakote (valproic acid). Antipsychoticmedications are also associated with gaining an average of four tonine pounds.\nIn the treatment of pain, however, the biggest culprits for\nweight gain are tricyclic antidepressants (such as Elavil). OtherEFFECTIVE THERAPIES FOR CHRONIC PAIN AND RELATED PROBLEMS\n248", "antidepressants such as those related to Prozac can cause either\nweight gain or weight loss depending on the individual. Medica-tions that increase norepinephrine such as Wellbutrin and Effexorare less likely to cause weight gain. In most studies, Lamictal pro-duced little or no weight gain.\nAlthough some medications used for pain management cause\nweight gain, others have the side effect of causing weight loss. Forexample, T opamax (topiramate) causes appetite suppression, withpeople on average losing 9 percent of their body weight. In stud-ies, the average weight loss was fourteen pounds; people whowere taking high doses (138 mg per day) lost more weight thanthose using low doses (70 mg a day, who experienced no weightloss). Zonegran (zonisamide), another antiseizure/pain medica-tion, is also associated with weight loss.ELIMINATING WEIGHT GAIN\n249", "This page intentionally left blank ", "Conclusion\nOne of the nice side effects of treating pain, \ufb01bromyalgia, and\nchronic fatigue syndrome is that in addition to feeling great youcan also look great.

Maybe you\u2019re a recent graduate\ntrying to figure out if product management is the right career for you. Maybe\nyou\u2019re an engineer actively transitioning into product management. Maybe\nyou\u2019re a start-up founder figuring out how to build your product division. Or\nmaybe you\u2019re already a product manager who naturally evolved into the role,", "seeking to fill gaps in your knowledge.\nFurthermore, there\u2019s a lot of wisdom out there regarding best practices for\nproduct managers, but most of it focuses on parts of the product-development\nlife cycle. This book  will give you an end-to-end view of what goes into\nbuilding a great product, as well as what product managers do e ach day.\nThe upcoming chapters will cover a mix of theory and practical advice to\nteach you how to identify an opportunity, and build a product successfully to\naddress that oppor tunity, whether the result is a new product or a refinement\nof an existing product. Whether you are new to product management, or an\nexperienced veteran, this book  is here to help you learn the needed skills to\nbe a successful and effective product leader.\nA brief word of warning: Much like chess, poker, and Minecraft, product\nmanagement is easy to learn, but can take a lifetime to master.

In this case,\nthose painfully frustrating words are from Ken Norton, partner at Google\nVentures, in a blog post titled \u201cHow to Hire a Product Manager.\u201d Think about\na company for a second. Engineers build the product. Designers make sure it\nhas a great user experience and looks good. Marketing makes sure customers\nknow about the product. Sales gets potential customers to open their wallets\nto buy the product. What more does a company need? Where does a product\nmanager fit into that mix?\nThose simple questions are what cause not only the confusion, but also the", "oppor tunity that comes with product management. Heck, if you\u2019re\ntransitioning into product management, these questions might make you worry\nthat product managers are irrelevant. And if you are currently a product\nmanager, you might feel a sudden need to justify your existence. Truthfully,\nwithout a product manager a company will continue to operate pretty well\u2014\nto a point. Yet with a strong product manager a company can become great.\nWHAT DO PRODUCT MANAGERS DO?\nPut simply, a product manager (PM) represents the customer No one buys a\nproduct because they want to give the company money. Customers buy and\nuse products because the products address their needs. Done properly, the\nproducts let the customers be awesome. The end result of representing the\ncustomer is that a PM helps the customer be awesome.\nThere\u2019s a lot behind this simple definition, though. Adam Nash, CEO of\nWealthfront and former VP of product at LinkedIn, summed up product\nmanagement by saying, PMs figure out what game a company is playing, and\nhow it keeps score (hint: it\u2019s not always about how much money the company\nmakes).\nDay to day, PMs must understand both business strategy and execution.\nThey must first figure out who the customers are and what problems the\ncustomers have. They must know how to set a vision, finding the right\noppor tunities in a sea of possibilities, by using both data and intuition. They\nmust know how to define success, for the customer and the product, by\nprioritizing doing what is right over doing what is easy. They must know how\nto work with engineers and designers to get the right product built, keeping it\nas simple as possible. They must know how to work with marketing to\nexplain to the customer how the product fills the customer\u2019s need better than", "a competitor\u2019s product. They must do whatever\u2019s needed to help ship the\nproduct, finding solutions rather than excuses. Sometimes, this even means a\nPM getting coffee for a team that\u2019s working long hours to show appreciation.\nBy the way, PMs manage products, not people, so they must achieve\neverything using soft influence, effective communication, leadership, and\ntrust\u2014not orders.\nEven though it\u2019s not always obvious what PMs do from the outside, they\ngenuinely do a  lot! PMs do s o much that they\u2019re sometimes even called \u201cMini\nCEOs.\u201d\nIronically, the thing a PM does the most is say \u201cno.\u201d Some people believe\nthat product managers just dictate what features to build. Given everyone has\nlots of ideas for features, why bother with a PM? It\u2019s true that everyone has\nlots of ideas, some of them good, but most ideas people have are for things\nthey want, not necessarily things customers want. For example, think of an\nengineer who spends her days using cryptic command-line tools\u2014I\u2019m sure\nyou know someone like this! This engineer probably prefers keyboard\nshortcuts, dislikes GUIs, and favors using code to explicitly specify meaning.\nNow, imagine that engineer is part of a team working on an iPad word\nprocessor for senior citizens. Do you think the features the engineer would\nprioritize match what the customers need? A large part of a PM\u2019s job is to\nfigure out the small number of key features to prioritize for the customer, and\nto lay the groundwork for long-term business viability by gracefully saying\n\u201cno\u201d to the numerous requests that don\u2019t fit the customer\u2019s needs.\nSimilar but Different\nIt\u2019s also worth looking at roles that are related to, but different from, product\nmanagement. These jobs get confused with product management because in", "some companies a product manager will also handle these roles\u2019\nresponsibilities, even though they aren\u2019t the product manager\u2019s primary\nstrengths. For example, remember how we said a good PM would do\nwhatever it took to ship the product? Further confusing things, all of these\nrelated roles are abbreviated \u201cPM.\u201d\nProject manage rs are most often confused with product managers. While\nthere are many subtle differences, they can be summed up by saying that a\nproject manager owns the schedule and helps ensure the team is on track to\nmeet any deadlines. The project manager will often work with the product\nmanager, and a product manager will provide input on the schedule. Project\nmanagers are masters of schedules and Gantt charts, not of representing\ncustomers.\nProgram manage rs are usually a bit more similar to product managers, but\nprogram managers generally focus more on the \u201cgetting it built\u201d side,\nworking closely with Engineering and Operations. If you\u2019re building a\nwearable, for example, the program manager will likely be in touch with the\nmanufacturing facility frequently, whereas a product manager will have\nlimited direct interaction with them. Program managers tend to be masters of\nexecution, sort of like a \u201csuper\u201d project manager.\nTo further confuse things, the title that describes what a product manager\ndoes varies slightly from company to company. Microsoft, for example, calls\nits product managers \u201cProgram Managers.\u201d Apple generally splits the\nproduct manager role into the \u201cEngineering Program Manager\u201d (EPM), and\nthe \u201cProduct Marketing Manager\u201d (PMM), with the PMM being closer to our\ndefinition a product manager, and the EPM being closer to a project manager.\nProduct managers are like the conductor in an orchestra. The conductor\nnever makes a sound but is responsible for making the orchestra as a whole", "sound awesome to deliver a great performance to the audience. Great\nconductors understand and engage with everyone in the orchestra, using the\nright vocabulary with each section, diplomatically moving everyone together\ntoward the shared goal of a great performance.\nProject managers help keep all the rehearsals organized so that the\norchestra will be prepared for the concerts. Program managers are involved\nin planning the entire season\u2019s schedule for the concert hall, setting things up\nso that the project managers can make each performance successful.\nBECOMING A PM\nThere\u2019s no obvious path to becoming a product manager. And if you\u2019re\nreviewing r\u00e9sum\u00e9s for potential PM hires, especially if you\u2019re a start-up\nfounder, it\u2019s not obvious what to look for. Most careers have a very clear-cut\npath\u2014you go to school, study computer science, and then you\u2019re set to\nbecome an engineer. Product management isn\u2019t one of those careers.\nBecause product management is a relatively new discipline, it has a much\nless formalized training process than other careers. Given that the role often\ncomes down to \u201cdoing whatever it takes to ship a product that customers will\nlove and that achieves business goals,\u201d product managers should be smart,\ntalented people who can figure things out on their own.\nBeyond that, product managers commonly have an intersection of a\ntechnical background\u2014n ot just engineering\u2014such as industry expertise, and\ncommunication skills. The most common type of product manager is someone\nwith an engineering/computer science background who became interested in\nbusiness. PMs often start out as individually contributing engineers who then\nfind themselves taking on more responsibilities: conducting customer\ninterviews, working with Design to validate ideas, and possibly even", "collaborating with marketing to make sure what they\u2019re working on aligns\nwith customer needs. They\u2019re not necessarily the best coders or the most\ndefinitive domain experts, but their mix of skills makes them unique.\nSometimes PMs come from Design, Marketing, or even business school!\nAt Product School, we often talk about the Product Triangle (Figure 1-1).\nThis is a simple way to visualize and understand where product management\n(ideally) sits in relation to other core departments: Engineering (product\ndevelopment), Design, and Marketing. This diagram is helpful for two\nreasons. First, it visually emphasizes that product management is a generalist\nrole and PMs need to be able to work with significantly different domains.\nSecond, as you go through the process of building a product, you will shift\nyour balance to different parts of the triangle\u2014more on this shortly. Thinking\nabout which leg of the triangle you\u2019re focusing on will let you think about the\nright way to communicate\u2014you\u2019ll talk with Design differently than you do\nEngineering\u2014and the right goals to set during each phase.", "Figure 1-1. The Product Triangle, showing product management at the intersection of three core\ndomains.\nA common question about becoming a PM is, how technical do PMs have to\nbe? They need to know enough that they can work effectively with engineers,\nparticipating in things like bug prioritization and scoping meetings, but they\ndon\u2019t need a computer science or electrical engineering degree. Especially\nfor software PMs, knowing how to code even a little will be beneficial, and\nif you want to become a PM but don\u2019t know how to code, we\u2019d highly\nrecommend learning the basics. Fortunately, there are plenty of resources to\nhelp you learn\u2014you can enroll in a boot camp like Code School or Hack\nReactor or take an online course from lynda.c om or Udemy.\nA big benefit to learning to code is that PMs frequently rely on a way of\nthinking common to coding\u2014top-down design and bottom-up\nimplementation. This means that you think about the big picture, break it", "down into small pieces, and then build those small pieces first. After\nbuilding the small pieces, you combine them to get the big picture. Learning\nto code will give you consistent practice thinking this way.\nAnother common question is, how business-oriented do PMs have to be?\nPMs don\u2019t need an MBA\u2014in fact, some tech companies prefer not to hire\nMBAs\u2014nor do they need a sales background. They should understand the\nindustry of the company they\u2019re interested in and be able to answer the\nfollowing questions: Who are the customers? Who are the major players?\nWhat differentiates one company from another? How do the businesses make\nmoney? PMs should also understand basic financial concepts such as revenue\nvs. profit\u2014revenue is how much money a company takes in, and profit is\nhow much is left after expenses.\nIn general, when we\u2019re working with people who want to make the\ntransition to being a product manager, we recommend they start with an\nindustry/company they\u2019re already very familiar with. That makes for an\neasier transition because they likely know the answers to many of the\nquestions above , even if they don\u2019t explicitly realize it! After you have a few\nyears of product management experience, it\u2019s fairly easy to switch to a new\ndomain, as you know the right questions to ask to be successful. If you\u2019re a\nfounder looking to build your start-up\u2019s product team, we\u2019d recommend\nfocusing on finding the best product person possible, even if that person isn\u2019t\nfamiliar with your dom ain.\nTypes of Product Managers\nWhile you will often hear people talk about product managers in the general\nsense, you will also hear about specialized product managers. Depending on\nyour background, you might find one of these specializations a more", "appropriate career choice than the general role.\nThe most common specialization is technical produc t manage ment. This\nrefers to a PM who has a strong technical background, and who works on a\ntechnical product. For example, this person might work on a software API\nwhere the end customer is a software developer. Technical PMs won\u2019t be\nwriting the code or performing technical tasks, but they need to understand\nthe details of what goes into those tasks.\nAnother specialization is strategic produc t manage ment. This role is the\ncomplement to a technical PM, and it\u2019s someone who has a strong business-\noriented background.\nOnce in a while, you\u2019ll also see titles linked to specific verticals or tasks,\nsuch as growth produc t manage r or mobile produc t manage r. These roles\nare more focused than the general PM role, and a person in such a role will\nhave a more specific set of skills, such as being an expert in all the different\nthings you can do to grow a product\u2014that is, get more customers using it.\nHOW PRODUCT MANAGERS GET PRODUCTS BUILT\nWhile sometimes it might seem like the CEO imagines a product in the\nshower, and then tells the engineering team to build it, any one who has been\na CEO knows this is not the case. Product management is similarly\nmisunderstood by the general public. On TV you\u2019re likely to see the guy get\nout of the shower and start hacking on a laptop with bright green text,\noccasionally solving a hard problem by drawing on glass. The real world\ndoesn\u2019t work like that. So, how do products get built? What does a product\nmanager really do, a nd how?\nIn reality, products continuously undergo a product-development life cycle,\nand a product manager shepherds the product through each phase, owning", "some phases and contributing to others. The product-development life cycle\ninvolves discrete steps, and each step emphasizes a different leg of the\nProduct Triangle.\nWhile the steps are well defined, there are multiple approaches to how\nthese steps can be implemented. On one end of the spectrum there\u2019s the lean\napproach, based on Toyota\u2019s manufacturing methods and adapted to\nsoftware/product development by Steve Blank and Eric Ries. The lean\nmethodology focuses on very fast, iterative cycles where your goal is to\nmake something small, release it, learn from it, and use that knowledge to\nfigure out what to do next. Lean cycles might happen in just a few days. On\nthe oppos ite end of the spectrum you have the waterfall approach, where you\nbuild something big in a very linear fashion\u2014you spend a lot of time\nplanning a product, and once you\u2019ve decided what to do, that\u2019s what you\u2019re\ngoing to build and ship even if it takes a long time. The product moves\nthrough each process step by step and, like a waterfall, things flow one way,\nand\u2014a lmost\u2014never change once they\u2019re defined it. Waterfall cycles might\ntake a year or more.\nFor software product development, larger and older companies tend to use\na waterfall approach, whereas many start-ups use a lean approach. As you\nmight expect intuitively\u2014and there have been many studies to back this up\u2014\nbuilding products with a lean approach is more successful because you\u2019re\nnot risking everything on a potentially long, slow-to-create project. Instead,\nyou risk a little bit to build something small, learn from it, and iterate. For\nthat reason, even larger and older companies are shifting towards a lean\napproach, moving away from waterfall.\nThe most common approach you\u2019ll encounter is a hybrid of waterfall and\nlean where the PM will plan a bit upfront to find the right opportunity, but", "then the teams will implement the product in an iterative way. This is nice\nbecause it lets you keep a big-picture goal in mind, but change course if\nneeded such as if you find a significant technical obstacle or find that\ncustomers don\u2019t want the product you\u2019re building. We\u2019ll mainly focus on a\nhybrid approach in this book .\nHardware product development takes a more waterfall approach because\nit\u2019s harder to change things you\u2019re physically building. For example,\nhardware requires a lot more planning up front, and the iterative cycles\nduring development to get new hardware builds are a lot longer than with\nsoftware. However, the overall principles for building products are very\nsimilar to those for software, and the process is similar enough that the life\ncycle stages we\u2019ll teach you about apply for both hardware and software\nproduct management.\nIn future chapters we\u2019ll dig into each stage of the product-development life\ncycle in depth. For now, let\u2019s look at an overview of each stage, starting with\nthe planning phase.\nTHE PRODUCT-DEVELOPMENT LIFE CYCLE\nEvery product goes through five key conceptual stages:\n1. Finding and planning the right oppor tunity\n2. Designing the solution\n3. Building the solution\n4. Sharing the solution\n5. Assessing the solution\nPut another way, this process involves figuring out what problem to work on,\nfiguring out how to solve it, building the solution, getting it in customers\u2019", "hands, and seeing if it worked for them. Sounds easy, right? Conceptually, it\nis! The devil\u2019s in the details. To help you see how each stage connects,\nbefore we dive deep, let\u2019s look at a high-level overview of each stage.\nFinding and Planning the Right Opportunity\nThe very first phase of the product-development life cycle is to find and\nclearly define the next oppor tunity to pursue. The world\u2019s a sea of\npossibilities! What should you build next? Usually, it\u2019s up to the product\nmanager to create and sort through all the possibilities, picking the right one\nto focus on next.\nThis phase is a critical part of your job. Unlike the other phases, where\nother disciplines take the lead, this phase is where product leads, taking input\nfrom other disciplines. It\u2019s probably the most different from anything\nexpected in another position. Because this is so core to your job, we\u2019ll cover\nfinding the right oppor tunity in extreme depth, breaking it down into three\nparts: strategically understanding a company (Chapter 2), creating an\noppor tunity hypothesis (Chapter 3), and validating that hypothesis (Chapter\n4).\nTo a product manager, strategically understanding a company involves\nlearning about aspects of the company that contribute to its product success\nincluding its target customers, its expertise, its competitive landscape, and\nmore. Understanding these aspects, which we sometimes refer to as a\ncompany\u2019s context, will help you make the right product decisions, and start\nto find focus in the sea of possibilities. A simple example is CNN.com\u2019s\nteam. They are great at building software products\u2014including a website and\nmobile apps\u2014that deliver the news quickly and efficiently to their\ncustomers. Because their PMs know they have software and not hardware", "expertise, they are\u2014probably\u2014not encouraging CNN.com to build a news-\nfocused smart watch, or other hardware product.\nClearly identifying the company\u2019s goals, another strategic element, will\nhelp you narrow down and prioritize the possibilities. At a high level,\ncompany goals fall into three categories: growth, revenue, and customer\nsatisfaction. Specifically, does the company want to get more users for the\nproduct, increase its revenue from the current customers, or make its current\ncustomers happier? If the goal is revenue, how does the company currently\nmonetize their product, and how can you increase the value for customers to\nmake them more willing to pay for the product? If the goal is growth, what\u2019s\nstopping new customers from using the product? If the goal is to delight their\ncustomers, what can you deliver that they would love, but wouldn\u2019t expect?\nBy understanding the current goals you can think strategically, and make sure\nthe products you\u2019re building align with those goals, helping the company be\nsuccessful.\nIn addition to these, there are some other strategic company context\nquestions you should know the answer to: What is the company building\nnow? What does it excel at compared to its competitors? Who are the key\ncustomers you aim to solve a problem for? What\u2019s the company\u2019s vision, and\n\u2014more fundamentally\u2014why does the company exist?\nWith the company\u2019s context in mind, the next step, which we\u2019ll cover in\nChapter 3, is to create an oppor tunity hypothesis. What do you believe is the\nright thing to work on next? It could be something as small as fixing a bug\nthat\u2019s been in your backlog for a while, or something as large as building an\nentirely new product.\nThese opportunity hypotheses come from many different places. Looking at\nhow existing customers use your product is a common source of new", "oppor tunities, allowing you to find ways to better serve your customers\u2014and\nyour company\u2019s goals. A metric is a measurement of a task a customer does\nwith your product. Collectively, your metrics can provide some great insight!\nFrom metrics, you might find an oppor tunity, such as wanting to get higher\nengagement with a component of your product.\nFor example, CNN.com likely keeps track of what headlines visitors click\non, how many people start watching each video, how many finish watching\neach video, how many scroll down and read each article, and more. They\nmight then use this data to pull out conclusions, such as, \u201cWe should\nprioritize video content instead of text because people tend to watch videos\nto completion and see each ad, whereas very few people read articles to\ncompletion.\u201d\nAfter thinking about the company\u2019s context and goals, talking with users,\nanalyzing usage data, looking at existing bug reports and feature requests, and\nusing other approaches we\u2019ll cover in Chapter 3, you\u2019ll have an idea about\nwhat to do next. But before you start to build a feature, you should do some\ntype of validation work to ensure this is the right oppor tunity to pursue, and\nthat it actually will help you achieve your goals. You have limited time and\nresources, and spending a little bit of time validating an oppor tunity\nhypothesis can often save you significant time and money by keeping you\nfocused on the best oppor tunities. Chapter 4 goes into depth about how to\nvalidate an idea.\nOnce you\u2019ve validated your idea, you\u2019ll need to develop it into something\nyour teams can implement. An important part of the product-planning phase\nin the product-development life cycle is scoping the oppor tunity. Scoping\nmeans clearly defining the oppo rtunity and the customers you want to target,\nalong with the requirements for the solution. If you\u2019re building a pen, do you", "need it to work in space? Underwater? Upside down? You\u2019ll want to clearly\ndefine these situations to help everyone understand what the product will\nneed to do w hen it\u2019s finished.\nWhen working in lean or hybrid environments, you\u2019ll often hear the phrase\nminimum viable produc t (MVP). This is a term from lean methodology that\nsimply means, \u201cWhat\u2019s the most minimally featured thing you can build that\nwill address the oppor tunity well for most of your target customers and\nvalidate your oppor tunity?\u201d In other words, if you were to think about the\ncore function you\u2019re trying to let customers accomplish, what\u2019s the simplest\nproduct you can build that lets them achieve that goal?\nContinuing our CNN example, if you went back in time and were working\non the first version of CNN\u2019s mobile app, what\u2019s the simplest app you could\nbuild that would provide value to your customers? It might be something with\na list of news headlines and a refresh button, and when you tap on each, you\nsee the video for the story. Again, the key to identifying the MVP is that\nyou\u2019re focused on the core functionality it provides to the user\u2014news, in this\ncase\u2014rather than focusing on all the possible features you might build in\naddition to that core function.\nIdentifying the MVP is a key part of scoping a product because it helps you\nidentify the most important thing to build first\u2014we\u2019ll cover tips on how to\ndo that in Chapter 5. This lets you focus your design and development efforts\nto create a\u2014hopefully\u2014useful product that you can deliver to customers\nquickly, whether as shipped software or software tested in house. Testing the\nMVP with real customers will help you figure out what other features will be\nin and out of scope, as you quickly will get real feedback about what\ncustomers like and don \u2019t like.\nNote that an MVP doesn\u2019t mean the product is bad or poorly built. In fact,", "quite the oppos ite\u2014it should be very good a t what it does, but it should focus\non doing only a few key tasks.\nContrast this with non-MVP-based approaches to product development,\nwhich are especially common in waterfall development. In that world, you\nend up spending lots of time trying to build the \u201cperfect\u201d product with every\nfeature you can imagine, it takes forever to build, and once it\u2019s out in the real\nworld you discover that customers don\u2019t use half the features you thought they\nwould.\nA key differentiator between lean and waterfall is that lean leverages\nMVPs. With a lean approach, you build the simplest thing you can, gather\ndata about how customers use it, and then refine the product if needed. This\nwill let you work quite effectively, building only the features customers want\nand will use rather than wasting time building things customers don\u2019t care\nabout.\nSpending lots of time iterating internally and building features without\nreleasing a product can be quite harmful to your business. With our\nhypothetical CNN app example, if we didn\u2019t take an MVP-based approach,\nwe might decide to replicate the website completely, including features like\ncomments, user-submitted video, and customized news streams. Building all\nthose features could delay our launch by months, and who knows how much\nof our customer base would use those features on their phones. Yes, we could\nuse metrics from the website to prioritize these features, but hopefully you\nget the point. Additionally, while we were taking lots of time and building\nfeatures for our unreleased app, our customers wanted a mobile news app\nand turned to Fox News or another competitor that built its app using an\nMVP-based approach. The customers cared about the core function\u2014getting\nnews on the go\u2014n ot about all the extra features. And it\u2019s hard to get", "customers back after they\u2019ve turned to a competitor!\nMost companies using a hybrid model never build a true MVP, but rather an\nMVP with some extra key features they believe will make the product more\nenticing. If you know for certain customers will want those key features,\nincorporating them from the start will help shorten the iteration cycle.\nTo be fair, hardware development often requires you to try to build more\nthan an MVP because releasing a hardware update is much more complex\nthan a software update. But keeping the MVP in mind, even with hardware,\nwill help you prioritize your development efforts.\nSometimes, as we\u2019ll discuss in Chapter 4, your very first MVP will be\nhuman-powered rather than automated. For example, if you\u2019re a PM at Yelp\nand want to add a restaurant-recommendation feature, eventually you\u2019ll\ncreate a fully automated algorithm to generate recommendations. But you\ncould build an initial MVP that makes it appear that the user is getting\nautomated recommendations when it actually has a human making and\nsending these lists. If many people like and use this feature, then great, you\u2019ll\nbuild the automation engine. If no one uses it, then this very lightweight MVP\nsaved you the time and effort of building the full feature.\nJust as important as scoping the problem is defining your success metrics.\nWhat are your goals with the product, and how do you keep score to see if\nyou\u2019re achieving them?\nGoing back to CNN.com, its ultimate goal might be to become the place\npeople go to for news. This means its success metrics include the number of\nviews on a piece of content, the percentage of people who consume each\npiece of content, the number of articles read or videos watched in a session,\nand how often the person comes back to CNN.com. The reason we don\u2019t\nsolely use page views on a piece of content is because a person might click", "on an article but never read it. That means that person is not actually getting\nnews/consuming content from CNN.com.\nProduct managers create a document that encompasses the entire planning\nphase, called a produc t requirements document (PRD), collecting all this\nplanning information in one spot. A PRD contains the explanation for why\nyou\u2019re pursuing this oppor tunity, the scoped problem definition, the success\nmetrics, and more. But you don\u2019t create the PRD in isolation\u2014you\u2019ll work\nwith your team, your boss, and other product stakeholders to make sure the\noppor tunity and requirements are clear and the goals are achievable.\nOne of the biggest reasons that other stakeholders, such as design and\nengineering leads, are involved in the PRD is that it will be up to them\u2014not\nthe product manager\u2014to figure out the right solution for this oppor tunity.\nAfter all, the design and engineering teams are the experts in their domains,\nand the product manager is not, even if she started her career in one of those\ndomains!\nPRDs gained a bad reputation from waterfall development because they\nwere huge dictating documents that people disliked reading. In fact, the lean\nmodel largely doesn\u2019t use PRDs. In the hybrid model, the PRD is treated as a\ngreat communications tool to get everyone on the same page and as a living\n\u2014not dictating\u2014doc ument. Over the product-development life cycle, the\nPRD will expand to contain more information, but it starts by clearly stating\nthe problem and why we\u2019re working on it. When the product\u2019s built, the PRD\nprovides a great reference for the sales and support teams to understand\nwhat\u2019s in the product and why. We\u2019ll go over how to effectively write and\nuse a PRD in Chapter 5.\nOnce we have this first draft of a PRD\u2014clearly identifying the\noppor tunity/problem and success metrics\u2014and all stakeholders have agreed", "on the right problem to focus on next, we\u2019ll move on to the next phase of the\nproduct-development life cycle.\nDesigning the Solution\nDuring this phase, covered in depth in Chapter 6, we\u2019ll figure out a feasible\nsolution to the problem we\u2019ve identified.\nHere, PMs will primarily work with the design team, but the engineering\nteam will offer input as well, to help gauge feasibility. For example, a\nCNN.com PM might have found that her readers complete a lot more articles\nwhen a virtual reality 360\u00b0  video is included, meaning better success\nmetrics, and the PM wants to integrate 360\u00b0  videos into more content. The\ndesign team might then create designs where every breaking news story has a\nlive-streaming 360\u00b0 video to put viewers right there with the reporter, but the\nengineering team might not be able to build a live-streaming solution. This\nmeans the design team needs to come up with another solution that the\nengineering team can implement.\nEven though the PM won\u2019t be coming up with the solution herself, she\u2019ll\nstay actively involved in this phase. She\u2019ll likely work closely with design to\nconduct user research, looking at people\u2019s current behavior. She\u2019ll also help\ncommunicate with Engineering to ensure Design isn\u2019t working in isolation\u2014\nthat everyone is working together to solve the customer\u2019s problems.\nContrary to popu lar belief, design doesn\u2019t just mean what the solution looks\nlike. Design involves aspects like information architecture (In what order are\nthings presented to the user?), wireframes (Where should the information live\non the screen?), and pixels (How does it look?). It\u2019s uncommon to find a\ndesigner who\u2019s an expert on every one of these aspects, and a PM will likely\nbe working with a design team rather than with just one designer to figure out", "how the product should function and look.\nIf possible, you\u2019ll want the design team to produce prototypes of the\nsolutions that they can test with customers to validate the design. These\nprototypes could be printouts that you swap in when the customer clicks on\nsomething, clickable mockups working with fake data, etc. The key is to have\nsomething that accurately represents the solution, but that you can mock up\nwithout having to actually build the solution.\nDesign is done when you have validated a prototype as a suitable solution,\nEngineering has agreed to the viability of the solution, and you\u2019ve defined the\nlook and feel of the solution that all stakeholders have agreed to.\nBuilding the Solution\nOnce you\u2019ve defined the problem and designed a solution, it\u2019s time to build\nit.\nCompanies have different approaches to implementing solutions, depending\non their history, the product, and their desires. For example, if you\u2019re\nworking on a mobile app, it\u2019s very easy to release a new version to\ncustomers every week, and development is likely focused on smaller but\nmore frequent releases\u2014lean development is very common with mobile and\nweb apps. If you\u2019re building hardware, there is a long time between the\nproduct\u2019s design and when its hardware is ready for mass production.\nHardware-engineering companies generally have fewer but very high-quality\nreleases. After all, it\u2019s difficult to release a hardware update to fix a bug!\nIn Chapter 7, we\u2019ll cover some of the most common software-development\nmethodologies, along with tips for working with engineers. Suffice it to say\nthe PM will stay involved throughout development, helping to prioritize bugs\n(backlog grooming), test software, and do whatever\u2019s needed to help the", "product ship.\nA note of caution if you\u2019re currently an engineer who wants to transition to\nproduct management\u2014de velopment might turn out to be the most frustrating\nphase to you because you are not an engineer anymore. You will not be\nwriting code for the product, or telling people what code to write. Your job\nis to stand aside, and let the people who are still engineers write the code.\nYou help them however else you can, even if it\u2019s getting them coffee, but\ndon\u2019t tell them what to do u nless they ask for your help.\nFurthermore, as a PM, you\u2019ll be put into positions where you have to\nnegotiate taking on technical debt, meaning you need to ask Engineering to\nwrite kludgey code that isn\u2019t sustainable in the long term to get something\ndone in the short term.\nEngineers hate taking on technical debt\u2014they want to write a complete\nanswer from the outset. If you come from an engineering background, taking\non technical debt can be hard. As a PM, you\u2019ll often have to make hard\ntradeoff decisions, accepting short-term debt to provide customer value\nfaster. The oppos ite is true as well, which is hard for PMs from a non-\ntechnical background. You\u2019ll have to pay off that debt later\u2014cleaning up the\ncode\u2014otherwise the code can get unwieldy, and it can become very hard to\niterate on the project.\nAlso, although we\u2019re presenting the product-development life cycle in a\nvery linear fashion, it\u2019s a lot more iterative in real life, especially between\ndesigning and building the solution. For example, while Design will have\nfigured out the most common use cases in the prototyping stage, there are\nlikely many edge cases that will come up while Engineering\u2019s building the\nproduct. Product, Design, and Engineering will work together to address\nthese needs and questions that arise while working on the product.", "During the development phase a PM should try to find effective\noppor tunities to share prototypes of the product with customers or people\ninside the company, so that you can get early feedback about the product.\nDoes it address the customer\u2019s need effectively, or is there a big tradeoff you\ndidn\u2019t anticipate? If you prioritize building the minimum viable product you\npreviously identified, then you can start testing the core product once the\nMVP\u2019s ready. It\u2019s important to ask for this feedback at the right times\u2014if you\nwait until right before you release to get feedback, you might not have time to\nact on what you learn.\nNew information that affects the product\u2019s scope might come up during\ndevelopment, too. Going back to our example of 360\u00b0  live-streaming on\nCNN.com, maybe a third-party company released a tool that makes it very\neasy to live-stream these videos. That\u2019d make it simple for CNN.com\u2019s\nengineers to add on-the-scene 360\u00b0  video to breaking news stories, which\nwas originally deemed out of scope because of the technical challenge.\nIn the product-development approach we\u2019re presenting in this book , it\u2019s\nalways best to do more investigation up front, so that you don\u2019t waste\nresources designing a solution and then have to change large parts of it. But\nthe best product managers are ones who know they can\u2019t define everything\nperfectly up front, and that it\u2019s generally impractical to spend months trying\nto do so. Instead they do their best to plan, but also seek out new information\nto help the product get better, and react to any needed changes with open\narms.\nThe development phase of the product-development life cycle is done when\na working product that has been thoroughly tested is ready for release.\nSharing the Solution", "As much as we\u2019d like to believe that if we build it, they will come, the world\ndoesn\u2019t work that way. Product marketing (Chapter 8)\u2014in fact, marketing in\ngeneral\u2014is an incredibly important part of the product-development life\ncycle, and really begins after we\u2019ve built the solution. This phase of the life\ncycle is where we launch our product, sharing it with the world and letting\nour customers know how our product will help them.\nEffectively telling the world about our product is so important that some\ncompanies even create a separate position, the produc t marketing manage r.\nA PMM is very similar to a PM, but a PM tends to be more internally\nfocused\u2014g etting the product built\u2014while a PMM is externally focused\u2014\nworking with customers to understand their needs and to communicate the\nproduct\u2019s value.\nEarly in the first stage of the product-development life cycle, even before\nscoping the oppor tunity, it should be clear what this product will do for the\ncustomer. This isn\u2019t a list of what features it has or what the product does,\nbut rather what problem it will solve. In the product marketing phase of the\nproduct-development life cycle, you figure out how to succinctly and\neffectively communicate how the product solves that problem and makes the\ncustomer awesome. It\u2019s essentially storytelling, and we call it \u201cmessaging.\u201d\nFor example, going back to CNN.com\u2019s 360\u00b0  VR video streaming feature, if\nwe promoted the feature itself, \u201cLive 360\u00b0  VR video streaming,\u201d most\ncustomers wouldn\u2019t know what that meant\u2014or care. Instead of talking about\nthe specific feature, we can focus on the value and the benefit this feature\nprovides: \u201cBe on the scene with our reporters.\u201d We might then go on to say\nwhat the feature is and how to use it, but we\u2019ve led with a clear message\nabout why a customer should care.\nThis phase of the product-development life cycle is more than just", "messaging, though. We\u2019ll also plan for the product\u2019s release. Release might\ninvolve planning a beta test, creating marketing assets for a website or ad,\nworking with key partners before release, briefing the press, or planning a\nlaunch event. The exact needs will vary from launch to launch.\nBroadly, this phase of the product-development life cycle is done when the\nproduct is launched, but there will likely be many marketing campaigns and\ntasks to help achieve the product\u2019s success metrics beyond the launch.\nMarketing will continue even while the team, internally, has moved on to the\nnext version of the product, or to a completely different product.\nAssessing the Solution\nThe last phase of the product-development life cycle is to assess how the\njust-completed iteration of the cycle went, see if you\u2019re on track to achieve\nyour success metrics, and come up with a recommendation for what to do in\nthe next iteration. As you might guess, that recommendation feeds into the\ninitial planning phase of the next iteration.\nDuring this phase, you will meet with the team that you built the product\nwith and assess how it went. Did everyone get so burned out that half the\nteam quit? Was the team very happy with the process and excited to work on\nthe next project? What was the team\u2019s overall competitive strength, and what\ncould they improve at? Use this feedback to determine what went well, and\nwhat you should do di fferently the next time around.\nNow that the product\u2019s released, you should start seeing real data about\nhow people are using it. Is it in line with your expectations, or is something\nfar off? And most importantly, does it look like you\u2019re on track to achieve\nyour success metrics? For example, CNN.com could look at how many\npeople are watching its new 360\u00b0  broadcasts and whether the overall number", "of people getting their content from CNN has increased after the release of\nthis new feature. If the number of people watching these broadcasts and\nseeking out more content on CNN improved, then your product was a\nsuccess. If it\u2019s unchanged, then you should evaluate why this strategy didn\u2019t\nwork how you expected\u2014w hy don\u2019t customers like it?\nOnce you\u2019ve had a chance to see how your new product was received by\nyour customers, you\u2019ll put together a recommendation for what\u2019s next: should\nyou iterate more on this feature/product, move on to something else, or end-\nof-life this feature/product? This recommendation will help inform the next\niteration through the product-development life cycle, and we\u2019ll explain how\nto create a good r ecommendation in Chapter 9.\nAs you can see, there\u2019s a lot to product management and the product-\ndevelopment life cycle! But don\u2019t worry, the following chapters will break\neach step down into more detail and help you understand how to be a great\nproduct manager who makes awesome products that customers love.", "One of the first things a great product manager should do before even thinking\nabout a product is to understand the company that makes it. Every company is\na little bit different, and they have different priorities, values, strengths, and\nweaknesses. Knowing these details about a company\u2014understanding the full\ncontext of its current situation\u2014is the starting point to find and evaluate\nproduct oppor tunities and make strategic product decisions. We\u2019ll build upon\nhow to leverage these details in the following chapters.\nAnalyzing a company breaks down into three main categories: What product\nare we building? How do we know if our product\u2019s good?  What else has\nbeen, is being, and will be built?", "WHAT PRODUCT ARE WE BUILDING?\nThis category of analysis is focused on the company\u2019s current product. This\nmight be an existing product that you\u2019re tasked with improving, or it might be\nthe next new product that you want to build.\nWhy Does the Company Exist?\nThe most fundamental thing to understand about a company is why it exists.\nWhat\u2019s its mission statement or, even more importantly, its core belief: the\nvalue it adds to the world that differentiates it from other companies?\nSimon Sinek has a great TED talk called \u201cHow Great Leaders Inspire\nAction\u201d and a book  on the same topic, Start With Why. In both, he advoc ates\nfor what he calls the Golden Circle (Figure 2-1). Specifically, he says that the\n\u201cwhy\u201d of a company is what people actually care about and buy into. How\nyou deliver that value and the products you create will build on top of this\ncore value. From a product point of view that \u201cwhy\u201d is your guiding light\u2014it\nwill help you figure out what fits with the company\u2019s reason to exist and what\ndoesn\u2019t. Put another way, the products you build are a means to an end. That\n\u201cend\u201d is the bigger picture and what customers buy into/want to achieve when\nthey buy your products.\nThink about storytelling\u2014the \u201cwhy\u201d is the theme. What\u2019s this story about?\nWhat specific viewpoint does the writer want to share with the world that led\nto her writing the story? Themes in movies are often obvious: love conquers\nall, revenge doesn\u2019t lead to happiness, etc. A company\u2019s theme can be a little\nharder to decipher. Often its theme is expressed as a value within the\ncompany\u2019s mission statement, which you can usually find on the website. But\neven if a company has a clear mission statement with a clear theme, it may\nforget about it when making decisions, leading to mixed results.", "Let\u2019s look at Sinek\u2019s example of Apple. If Apple started with the \u201cwhat,\u201d\nwhich many companies do, Sinek asserts its messaging would read, \u201cWe make\ngreat computers. They\u2019re user-friendly, beautifully designed, and easy to use.\nWant to buy one?\u201d That\u2019s fine, but it sounds pretty generic. Many other PC\nmanufacturers even make the same claim!\nFigure 2-1. Simon Sinek\u2019s Golden Circle, starting with \u201cwhy\u201d as the most important aspect of a\ncompany.\nInstead, recall the Think Different campaign Apple ran in the late \u201990s, which\ntalked about Apple\u2019s \u201cwhy\u201d without even mentioning the products: \u201cHere\u2019s to\nthe crazy ones.\u201d Starting from that mission statement, Sinek says a more\nrealistic marketing message from Apple would be, \u201cWith everything we do,", "we aim to challenge the status quo. We aim to think differently. Our products\nare user-friendly, beautifully designed, and easy to use. We just happen to\nmake great computers. Want to buy one?\u201d\nThat version starts with the \u201cwhy\u201d (challenging the status quo), then moves\ninto the \u201chow\u201d (being user-friendly, etc.), and finally the \u201cwhat\u201d (selling great\ncomputers). It\u2019s way more compelling than the first version, and it also says a\nlot more about what Apple represents, and who they are as a company.\n\u201cWhy\u201d is at the core of the Golden Circle because it\u2019s the most fundamental\nthing you need to understand about a company. Everything a company does,\nfrom the products it builds to the feature decisions it makes for those products,\nshould emerge from that value. If it doesn\u2019t, there\u2019s a good chance that\ndecision isn\u2019t working well for the company.\nGoogle writes its mission statement as, \u201cTo organize the world\u2019s information\nand make it universally accessible and useful.\u201d There\u2019s an implicit value\npropos ition of driving the human race forward, which Google does, primarily\nwith data. It\u2019s unlikely to make a toaster oven, even a Wi-Fi-connected one,\nbecause that doesn\u2019t organize the world\u2019s information, make it accessible, or\ndrive us forward. However, Google did purchase Nest, which made\nappliance-like devices, including a thermostat and a smoke detector. Nest\u2019s\nproducts involve organizing information about your home and applying\ncomputer science to that information to make your home function better. The\nNest Thermostat learns your behavior and automatically adapts how it heats\nand cools your house to save energy\u2014thereby saving you money\u2014while still\nkeeping you comfortable.\nIt\u2019s worth noting that every company whose fundamental mission is \u201cto make\nmoney\u201d rather than focusing on what value it can add to customers\u2019 lives has\nfailed. Sinek discusses this in detail in his talk. If your company functions", "well and customers want the products you\u2019re making, you\u2019ll make money.\nRevenue is validation that a company is doing the right thing for its customers\n\u2014revenue should not be a company\u2019s reason for existing. This isn\u2019t true for\nonly socially conscious companies like TOMS, the shoe company, but for all\ncompanies. Customers will pay for your product because it makes their lives\nbetter, not because they want to give you money.\nSimilarly, companies that start without a mission, but rather with some\ninvention that they\u2019re trying to find a use for, often fail. Specifically, if your\ncompany started because someone said, \u201cThis is a cool idea\u2014can we sell\nit?\u201d rather than \u201cThis invention would make people\u2019s lives better because\u2026,\u201d\nyou have a solution looking for a problem. An engineering innovation by itself\ndoesn\u2019t make a product\u2014products are solutions to problems people\nencounter. You\u2019ll often hear startups talk about \u201cpivoting\u201d because they found\ncustomers didn\u2019t want the product they made, and the startup is trying to\nrepurpose what it built to something customers will use.\nSome companies are moderately successful without having a clear mission\nstatement. But they struggle to grow because it\u2019s be unclear to their leadership\nwhy their product was successful and how to expand the product line. The\nresult is a product portfolio that feels very disconnected. Misfit, which was\npurchased by Fossil, achieved success with its Shine wearable activity\ntracker, but it didn\u2019t have a clear mission. Its follow-up products included a\nsmart light bulb and sleep sensor, and they failed to gain much attention.\nMisfit appears to be aware of this problem and has tried to fix it, though, as\nit\u2019s now focused on making wearables a natural part of your life, with\nfashion-conscious activity trackers, and smart headphones with a built-in\nactivity tracker. The implicit value propos ition is that Misfit wants you to live\na better life, and it achieves that by enabling you to analyze your life,", "especially your health.\nAs a product manager, keeping the company\u2019s core value propos ition in\nmind will help you understand the company\u2019s vision. Understanding the vision\nwill let you understand the company\u2019s goals, which lets you understand its\nproduct roadmap. We\u2019re getting ahead of ourselves here! Suffice it to say,\nyour first task when looking at a company from a product point of view needs\nto be understanding its \u201cwhy.\u201d\nCustomers and Personas\nThe most fundamental part of a company, after why it exists, is who it\u2019s\nsolving problems for. Essentially, who are the customers for your product, and\nwhy are they buying your product? You will optimize your products for these\npeople.\nLet\u2019s imagine we\u2019re building a camera accessory that plugs into the iPhone,\nlike the DxO ONE. Your customers are likely people who enjoy shooting with\ntheir smartphones, but want better image quality than the built-in camera\nprovides. Since we\u2019re iPhone-specific, we won\u2019t care about people with\nAndroid phones. And, since we\u2019re building an accessory that people need to\npay extra for, we will ignore people who are happy with the built-in camera.\nBut even amongst all the customers we do care about, there\u2019s a lot of\nvariability. Maybe one loves taking photos of his dogs while another takes\nphotos of her ferrets. Dealing with lots of real people and their variability can\nmake for complex discussions\u2014our camera accessory has to work with cats,\ndogs, ferrets, rabbits, etc. Instead, it would be easier if we just abstracted\nthings and said, \u201cOur customers take photos of their pets.\u201d\nWe can take the various common traits we care about in our potential\ncustomers and abstract them out into a persona. A persona is a fictional,", "typical customer, and defining key personas lets you segment your customers\nby highlighting the things your customers care about that are relevant to your\nproduct. Personas are tools to help you understand your customers, they are\nnot actual end customers. A great way to think about the difference is that\nFacebook  and Snapchat have many of the same customers, but their internal\npersonas\u2014how they segment those customers and what aspects of the product\nthey care about\u2014are different.\nYou\u2019ve likely already talked about a persona without realizing it. When\nsomeone asks, \u201cCan my mom use it?\u201d they don\u2019t mean their actual mom, she\nmight be a rocket scientist. Instead, they mean the \u201cmom\u201d persona of a middle-\naged person who is never the first to buy new technology, and will break\nmany gadgets simply by turning them on. When we say, \u201cCan my mom use it?\u201d\nwe\u2019re actually asking if the product is user-friendly enough that someone in\nthe \u201cmom\u201d persona can use the product to achieve a goal without breaking it\nand without asking for help.\nGood personas will have a picture and a fictional name. They will include\nany relevant details about the person\u2019s life such as demographics, outside\nactivities, and common tasks, as well as what problems the person is looking\nto solve. Think of a full persona as a way to bring a typical customer to life\u2014\nyou want enough detail that you can imagine yourself in the persona\u2019s shoes.\nRoman Pichler put this into a template you can fill out to start crafting your\nown personas (Figure 2-2).", "Figure 2-2. Roman Pichler\u2019s persona-building template, available at www.romanpichler.com and\nincluded under the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported (CC BY-SA 3.0) license, \nhttps://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0.\nWhile it\u2019s tempting to make your personas very detailed, describing every\naspect of the person\u2019s life, they can quickly become overwhelmed with lots of\nirrelevant details. Keep them as sparse as possible overall, but with enough\ndetail that they\u2019re believable and represent a real target market. If you\u2019re\nwondering how to do this, write a detailed persona, and for every statement\nyou make about the person, if it\u2019s not relevant to your product, delete it.\nThe key things you\u2019re looking for are this person\u2019s priorities, related to your\nproduct/area of expertise. What is the persona \u201cIT Tech Tom\u201d trying to do\nthat\u2019s significant and what\u2019s actually insignificant: What extreme pain points\ndoes he have and what pain points are insignificant? What are the things he", "must have from any solution you create? For example, IT Tech Tom might be\nvery busy his entire workday with customer support tickets. He would likely\nfavor a new automated machine deployment system over one that involves lots\nof manual intervention.\nA way to envision these customer\u2019s priorities is to imagine the customer\u2019s\njourney. What problem is a given persona trying to solve, what does he do\nwhen he tries to solve it, and what happens as a result? Tell us a story about\nthe customer.\nDon\u2019t forget about the social or emotional side. Dental headgear can solve\northodon tic problems\u2014a significant pain point\u2014bu t do you want to be the kid\non the playground who has to wear headgear for two years? Other factors,\nlike which distribution channels reach the various personas, and whether\nthey\u2019re willing to pay for different parts of the product, can help differentiate\npersonas.\nPersonas contain demographic information only if it\u2019s relevant. For example,\nAirbnb\u2019s \u201chost\u201d personas probably don\u2019t include how much each person\nmakes per year, but they likely do include why a persona is interested in\nrenting her place out. A young urban host might be renting a couch or second\nbedroom to help pay for his condo. In fact, he might have to do so, meaning he\ncares most about maximizing how much he gets for his space vs. having\nsomeone there all the time. A retired couple who are snowbirds, flying from\nPennsylvania to Florida each winter, might want to rent out their vacation\nhome when they\u2019re not using it, to supplement their income. They\u2019ll likely\nprefer Airbnb guests who stay for longer periods of time, and treat the home\nlike their own, even if it means their vacation home is empty periodically.\nThis might be counter to what you know about typical marketing theory,\nwhere demographics are key. Again and again, product theory and practice", "have shown that focusing on a common problem, pain, or desire yields better\nsegmentation than demographics.\nHarvard Business School professor Clayton Christensen has been working\non a customer-segmentation approach he calls \u201cjobs to be done\u201d for over a\ndecade. Thinking this way helps build great personas. The example\nChristensen gives is that when a fast-food company tried to improve its\nmilkshake sales, it first did traditional demographic segmentation and asked\neach persona (e.g., the 18\u201335- year-old milkshake drinker) about her ideal\nshake and implemented changes. Sales were stagnant.\nBut when the fast-food company focused on who bought milkshakes, when\nthey bought them, and where they drank them, it found a different way to\nsegment its customers. One segment bought milkshakes in the morning to keep\nthem feeling full until lunch. As an added benefit, the morning milkshake gave\nthem something to occupy their free hand while driving during a boring\ncommute. That group wants a milkshake that takes a while to drink so that it\nlets them feel full longer and lasts for the commute. Now consider another\nsegment: customers buying milkshakes as a special treat for young children.\nKids likely just want a tasty treat and don\u2019t have the patience to drink a\nmilkshake for 30 minutes. Using pains and goals instead of just demographics\nwill help you segment your customers into useful personas.\nIt\u2019s possible your product has multiple personas. For example, the people\nwho read and write reviews on Yelp are customers, but the businesses these\npeople review are also Yelp\u2019s customers. Create multiple personas if needed,\nand identify the primary one you want to satisfy.\nSometimes the customer and the buyer\u2014the person using the product and the\nperson actually purchasing it\u2014aren\u2019t the same, such as parents buying a swing\nset for their kids. This is common with enterprise software, and you\u2019ll need to", "create separate personas for these cases.\nUltimately your goal with each persona is to have enough information and\ndetail about that category of customer that you can imagine yourself in this\nperson\u2019s shoes. This will help you empathize with that customer, understand\nhis pain points, and think about ways your product can solve that pain (we\u2019ll\ngo into this in depth in Chapter 3).\nBecause personas help you understand what a group of customers is like, a\nkey piece of a persona is to be authentic\u2014if you find your persona is\nincredibly busy, working 80+ hours/week, how much time do you think he\u2019ll\nhave to learn how to use your product? If you fail to note how much your\npersona works, you could make the wrong product decisions, errantly\nassuming this persona has time to watch a long onboarding video tutorial.\nWhenever you start working on a new product or at a new company, find out\nas soon as possible who the relevant personas are. Make sure they\u2019re clearly\nwritten down in the Name/Picture/Details/Goals format. Many companies use\nWord or Google Docs files with their persona data, and there are specialized\ntools that explicitly manage your personas and organize the research that goes\ninto each one (As of the time of writing, the landscape of persona tools is so\nin flux that we\u2019ve elected to leave it up to you to search and find what\u2019s\ncurrent).\nIf there\u2019s nothing written down, it\u2019s still likely the company has a rough idea\nof who its customers are. Use that knowledge to write down a first draft of the\npersona, you will revise it over time.\nIt\u2019s not mandatory to have pre-existing customer knowledge to build a\npersona. Just make your personas rough at first, and as you learn more about\nyour customers, refine the personas, perhaps dividing them up and creating a\nnew persona when key differences appear. You might even find as you talk", "with customers and show them prototypes of your product/feature that\nsomeone you thought was a certain persona really isn\u2019t.\nTake Airbnb, for example. Even though business travelers travel frequently,\nthey might not be the best persona for Airbnb to focus on because they\nexpense their hotel rooms, meaning they\u2019re not price sensitive, they care more\nabout service than connecting with the host, and they often have rewards cards\nthat let them accumulate free stays for personal travel. Airbnb focuses on\nmaking interactions with your host and other locals part of your travel\nexperience. Business travelers, however, are there to work, not to feel like a\nlocal. All of that means they\u2019re currently better served by regular hotels, and\nAirbnb might choose not to spend lots of time targeting that persona right now.\nYou\u2019ll also want to ensure your personas align with what your product does.\nIf you\u2019re building payroll software for a small to medium-size business, your\npersonas should be based on coffee shops and doctor\u2019s offices, not a stay-at-\nhome dad. Stay-at-home dads won\u2019t have any reason to buy your software,\nand you want to spend your time making decisions based on the customers\nwho will buy and use your software.\nNote that \u201ceveryone\u201d is not a persona, as \u201ceveryone\u201d is too vague to help\nyou make decisions. Many people think that big companies like Google,\nFacebook , and Apple target \u201ceveryone,\u201d but they don\u2019t and are quite forward\nabout it. Facebook  started off targeted at one persona, college students. Over\ntime Facebook  grew, adding high-school students and beyond, and its current\ncustomer base is very diverse. Facebook  likely has many internal personas,\nbut when it releases new features, they\u2019re still targeted at specific personas. A\n\u201cHenrietta High-School Student\u201d persona doesn\u2019t care about the reviews\nfeature on business pages, but a business that created a Facebook  page\ncertainly does!", "Another great attribute to consider about your personas is where on the\nadoption curve they fall. Not everyone buys/starts using something new at the\nsame time. There\u2019s a general theory of adoption\u2014which can refer to a new\nproduct or a new feature\u2014that says there\u2019s a tiny group of early adopters that\nhave to be the first to have new things\u2014think of the first person you know to\nown a smartwatch. Then, there\u2019s a slightly larger group of people who like\nbeing one of the first\u2014bu t not necessarily the first\u2014to have something new\u2014\nthink of the first person you know who bought an Apple Watch but didn\u2019t own\na previous smartwatch.\nUnfortunately, there\u2019s a gap (see Figure 2-3) before you get to the next group\nof people. If your product\u2019s awesome and delivers on a value propos ition\nyour customers care about, you\u2019ll continue on to the next step, mass-market\nadoption, when the bulk of potential customers buy/use your product.\nEventually, even the late adopters\u2014the people who always seem to be years\nbehind everyone else technology-wise\u2014will start using your product.\nConsidering where your various personas fit into this curve will help you\nunderstand when they\u2019re likely to adopt your new product or feature. This\nwill help prioritize features. Early adopters will tolerate missing features that\nlaggards might require, for example.", "Figure 2-3. The adoption curve where the x-axis represents the groups of customers that will potentially\npurchase your product over time. The y-axis represents the approximate market share of each group.\nBut if your product isn\u2019t awesome, when you hit the chasm before mass-\nmarket adoption, your growth will stop because your product doesn\u2019t provide\nenough value to most people\u2019s lives. The mass market won\u2019t adopt it.\nWhenever you think about how to make a product better, your first thoughts\nshould be about who the target personas are and what needs they have that\naren\u2019t currently being met by the product. This gives you a great immediate\nfilter to make sure you\u2019re making strategic decisions about what to do n ext.\nUse Cases\nUse cases are simply how a company expects each persona to use the\ncompany\u2019s product to achieve a goal. They provide the context to let you\nunderstand the link between your personas and your products.\nDay to day, a PM will need to think about what use cases they want to\nsupport for their product, which helps in finding and prioritizing\noppor tunities. The use cases will affect everything from what features you\nprioritize to solve your customers\u2019 problems to what customers you\u2019ll market\nyour product to.", "For example, a key use case for an iPhone is checking your email on the go.\nApple will make product decisions for the iPhone that help you know when\nyou have new mail, and let you reply to mail, compose new mail, etc.\nConversely, the iPhone isn\u2019t designed to help you press cloves of garlic,\nalthough you could theoretically use it to do so\u2014w e\u2019d recommend buying a\ngarlic press instead. Apple cares about the former, not the latter. The choices\nit makes will be focused on improving email on the go, even if it means a\nfuture iPhone is no good f or cooking with garlic.\nThat example is pretty drastic and obvious, so let\u2019s look at a more subtle\nexample companies often face. One major category of company is called\nenterprise or B2B (business to business), which applies to companies that\ncreate tools to address other companies\u2019 work-related needs. B2B companies\nwill frequently pick a size of customer company to focus on\u2014small, medium,\nor large\u2014and then further focus on select industry verticals.\nGusto, formerly ZenPayroll, is an HR-solutions company for small\nbusinesses. It realized that small businesses have a wide range of fairly\ncomplex \u201crun the business\u201d (RTB) needs such as HR, accounting, and office-\nadministration. One person usually can\u2019t do all of those tasks, small\nbusinesses don\u2019t have the resources to hire many people to do those tasks, and\nexisting tools like ADP are overkill for small businesses.\nGusto\u2019s initial persona was likely a small-business owner\u2014we\u2019ll call her\n\u201cSuzanne Small Business Owner.\u201d The Gusto website lists instances of this\npersona, including in her repertoire tech startups, coffee shops, auto shops,\ncreative agencies, law firms, and restaurants. Those are the customers Gusto\ntargets.\nLet\u2019s pretend Suzanne owns a coffee shop. Put yourself in her shoes for a\nsecond\u2014w hat are the RTB tasks she has to deal with? The simplest ones are", "around payroll: she wants a way to collect W2-related information (US-\ngovernment-required work forms) for her employees, she wants an easy way\nto pay employees, and she wants an automated way to provide them with tax\ninformation. These situations she wants to address\u2014problems she wants to\nsolve\u2014are use cases she might want to use Gusto for, and Gusto will likely\nbuild features to solve these problems.\nAt the top of Gusto\u2019s website is a Payroll link. When you click on it you\u2019ll\nsee that Gusto specifically states how it has employee self-onboarding for\nW2s and more, payroll solutions, and automated taxes. It has built features\ninto its product to enable it to work in these use cases that its target persona,\nSuzanne Small Business Owner, has.\nGusto initially focused on one use main use case: payroll management. But\nover time it has expanded to cover more use cases, such as health insurance.\nOver time, Gusto will likely continue to help small businesses simplify their\nRTB tasks. They\u2019ll be addressing more use cases that Suzanne Small Business\nOwner deals with.\nHowever, if a large business tried to use Gusto, the business would find\nfeatures it needed lacking because its requirements are more complex than\nthose of the small businesses that Gusto targets. Gusto doesn\u2019t handle all the\nuse cases for a large business, but a more complex product like ADP does\nhandle those use cases.\nDown the road, Gusto could choose to expand to support another customer, a\nlarge business. To address that customer, Gusto would create personas to\nrepresent the different types of large-business customers, like \u201cMultinational\nMatt.\u201d Gusto would then add features to the product to address the use cases\nlarge business have but small businesses don\u2019t, like dealing with multiple\ninternational offices. This would be one way to grow and to gain more", "customers. However, supporting large businesses and their use cases isn\u2019t\ncurrently a priority for Gusto, so it hasn\u2019t built features to address these\nneeds.\nBy focusing on specific use cases for specific personas, you can ensure that\nyour product addresses the needs of those personas effectively, which makes\nyour end customers happy. Adding features to support new use cases or\nmaking it easier to achieve current use cases is a common source of product\noppor tunities.\nEnterprise vs. Consumer Companies\nRelated to use cases and personas is knowing if the company is developing\nenterprise (B2B) or consumer (also called business-to-consumer or B2C)\nproducts. This simply means asking whether end customers are using the\nproduct in their personal lives, or at work. You likely don\u2019t need payroll\nsoftware at home, and you likely don\u2019t need a smartphone-connected sous\nvide device at work.\nThe primary difference in how these companies function is that B2B\ninvolves more decision makers, and the people who decide to buy the product\nare often not the ones using it\u2014e.g., a CTO will approve buying software for\nHR, but it\u2019s HR who uses it day to day. B2B companies often have larger\nsales forces with specialized roles such as sales engineers who help integrate\nthe product into the customer\u2019s environment, and customer-training roles.\nYou\u2019re unlikely to just start using SalesForce out of the box, for example, nor\nare you expected to.\nB2B software also historically emphasized utility over usability: that is, as\nlong as it solved your problem, it\u2019s OK if it\u2019s really painful to use. However,\nB2B technology has shifted to focus more on the end customer rather than just", "the decision maker. As we\u2019ve seen with Slack, Gusto, and more, B2B\ncompanies are acting more like B2C companies, creating software with\nintuitive design that you can use out of the box with little training, just like you\ndon\u2019t need training to use Facebook .\nThe tools and techniques you\u2019ll learn in this book  will apply to bot h styles of\ncompanies. You\u2019ll build personas and break down use cases regardless of\nwhether you\u2019re building B2B or B2C products. Just be aware that you\u2019ll have\nto do extra legwork to account for the additional decision makers and their\npersonas in a B2B company. B2B software is also more likely to be subject to\nlegal compliance requirements and to need to function in a multi-user\nenvironment, which creates additional fundamental product requirements that\nB2C software doesn\u2019t have.\nHOW DO WE KNOW IF OUR PRODUCT\u2019S GOOD?\nIn Chapter 1, we mentioned that a big part of product management is knowing\nhow we keep score. Metrics, in particular success metrics, are how we\nmeasure that score.\nMetrics are the measurement of different aspects of your product. These\nmight include things within your product, like how many people complete a\ntask, or things affected by your product, like how much revenue you\u2019re\nmaking. Success metrics, sometimes called key performance indicators\n(KPIs), are the key metrics that define how we keep score, like how many\ngoals you scored in a soccer game.\nSuccess metrics are useful because they help us validate if our current\nstrategy is working, and if it\u2019s not we can dig into the overall metrics to come\nup with a hypothesis for how we could make changes to achieve our success\nmetrics (more on this in Chapter 3). While product management sometimes", "feels like more of an art than a science, metrics provide the data-driven,\nscientific backbone to product management.\nYour success metrics are defined by your current strategy and goals. Overall\ncompany success metrics come from the company\u2019s short- and long-term\nstrategy goals, with long-term metrics being defined by the company\u2019s core\nvalues\u2014the \u201cwhy\u201d we talked about earlier. If part of your company\u2019s mission\nis that you want your customers to love your products, then a key ongoing,\nlong-term strategy company success metric will be how satisfied your\ncustomers are with each product.\nYou will have additional success metrics that change over time based on\nyour short-term goals. For example, it\u2019s common to see companies switching\ntheir short-term goal from growth (people are using our product) to revenue\n(people like our product enough to pay for it). When goals change, what was a\nsuccess metric one week might just be considered a regular metric the next\nweek.\nGenerally, you\u2019ll have separate company and product success metrics, and\nthe product success metrics will support the company metrics. Maybe your\ncurrent company success metric is brand awareness, a common initial success\nmetric for startups. In that case, your product success metrics will include\nnumber of downloads of your app, visits to your website, and so on: metrics\nthat indicate people are aware of your company and products.\nLater on, your strategy might shift to making your app part of people\u2019s lives,\nin which case your success metrics will focus on engagement: Of those who\ndownloade d the app, how many complete a core task? How many customers\ndo that task each day/week/month? As your strategy and success metrics\nchange, your product plan and the features you choose to work on will\nsimilarly shift\u2014you want to make sure what you\u2019re working on supports your", "goals and success metrics.\nIt\u2019s critical to compare these metrics over time, allowing you to see if your\nstrategy is working. You might be using revenue as a success metric\u2014getting\npeople to open their wallets is a sign they value your product\u2014and perhaps\nyou have $1 million in revenue right now. That seems great until you realize\nyou had $10 m illion in revenue last month.\nA common question PMs deal with is, how do we pick the right goals and\nsuppor ting success metrics to focus on? In general, it depends on your\ncompany. But Sarah Tavel, who was Pinterest\u2019s founding PM for search and\ndiscovery and is now a partner at Greylock, noticed a trend in the success\nmetrics of successful consumer-focused internet startups, and she wrote up her\nfindings in a blog post entitled \u201cThe Hierarchy of Engagement.\u201d\nTavel noted that there are three distinct strategy phases startups, and by\nextension new products, go through: engagement, retention, and self-\nperpetuating. Startups that go through all three tend to turn into multibillion-\ndollar companies, whereas startups that get stuck in one phase commonly fail.\nThe goal of the first phase is to get customers using your product and\ncompleting the core action, like posting a photo to Instagram. This is a sign\nthey\u2019re engaged with your product, and we could say that completing the core\naction is a success metric that supports an engagement goal.\nPinterest\u2019s core action is pinning something. In 2011, when Pinterest was\ngrowing well, over 50% of its weekly users were still pinning things.\nCompare this to Viddy, a video-sharing startup that became popu lar in 2012.\nWhen Facebook  started featuring Viddy content on April 24, Viddy\u2019s growth\nskyrocketed to about 35 million users, as you see in Figure 2-4. But the daily\nactive users and the people actually posting content was much lower, peaking\naround 5 million users, or around 14% of all users. Even though Viddy", "appeared to be doing well, with lots of people signing up, very few\ncompleted that core action. Viddy shut dow n in late 2014.\nFigure 2-4. A graph of Viddy\u2019s monthly active users (top line) vs. daily active users (bottom line) for\nApril/May 2012, from KPCB/Mary Meeker\u2019s Internet Trends report.\nNow let\u2019s look at the second of Tavel\u2019s three phases, retention. After\ncompanies saw good engagement\u2014what \u201cgood\u201d  means varies\u2014they\u2019d shift\ntowards retaining users with success metrics around how frequently those\ncustomers use the product in a given time period. The idea is that if the\nproduct gets better for users over time, they will keep using it and they\u2019ll miss\nout if they leave. In fact, it\u2019s better to have slightly slower growth but a higher\npercentage of customers continuously using the product than constant growth\nbut low retention because you\u2019ll end up with more customers over time.", "A simple example of this is frequent-flier points on airlines: The more you\nfly, the more status you achieve and the more pleasant flying becomes. In\nsoftware, think about social networks. The bigger the audience you\u2019ve built up\non Twitter, the more you\u2019d have to lose by stopping using Twitter and trying to\nrebuild your audience on another network. Products that don\u2019t encourage\ncustomers to continuously use them are easily replaceable. Lyft and Uber are\nthe same for an end customer whether you\u2019ve ridden once or a hundred times.\nYou likely just request a ride from whichever service has the shortest wait\ntime. And if a new competitor comes around that offers an incentive, such as\nride 10 times and get $10 in credit, you lose nothing by deleting the Uber app\nand using the competitor instead.\nThe final phase that Tavel describes is when your goal is self-perpetuation.\nThis means your product has various loops  that keep the customer engaged,\nand encourage other customers to get engaged. Your success metrics will be\naround how often people complete these loops . Pinterest gets better when\nmore people post pins because this leads to better discovery of new, relevant\nthings to pin. And sharing notifications (which we\u2019ll look at more in Chapter\n3 with the Hook Canvas) encourage both new customers to pin something and\nexisting users to return to the product.\nTavel goes on to describe cohort performance as the ultimate success metric\nyour company should look at over time, encompassing all three of these\nstages. Specifically, look at the number of weekly users completing the core\naction and the percentage of weekly active users completing the core action\nover time. This shows growth from the size of the cohort, engagement from the\nratio of users completing the core action, and retention from your performance\nover time.\nWhile these stages don\u2019t apply directly to some products, like a B2B product", "a company mandates its employees use, the principles are still applicable.\nYou want your customers to be able to complete the core tasks in your product\nsmoothly and repeatedly, and as long as those core tasks align with use cases\nyour customers care about, your product is off to a good s tart.\nVanity vs. Actionable Metrics\nAs product managers, we see a lot of metrics. Some are more helpful to us\nthan others, and we often talk about two categories of metrics: vanity and\nactionable. Vanity metrics are those that sound useful, and might be great for\nsome other business need, but don\u2019t help us measure product performance.\nActionabl e metrics are real data we can use to make decisions.\nLet\u2019s look at an example, using Tavel\u2019s first phase, engagement. When you\u2019re\nlaunching a new product, say an app, as a product manager your goal is to\nhave people completing the core task. Maybe 1 million people downloaded\nyour app on the first day\u2014congrats! That sounds awesome, right? While\ngetting someone to be aware of and download your app is the first step, it\ndoesn\u2019t mean they actually opened and used your app\u2014t hings look very\ndifferent if only 10 pe ople actually completed your app\u2019s core task.\nNumbers like page views and downloads are vanity metrics because they\nsound useful. They might be useful in investor pitch decks, negotiating\ndisplay-ad prices,1 million people look at our pages each day!, and for other\ncompany needs. But from a product management point of view, they don\u2019t help\nus measure if our product is successful.\nInstead, product managers need to focus on actionable metrics that let us\nmake decisions. Now that we know only 10 people completed our product\u2019s\ncore task, we can look at other metrics to try and figure out why so few\npeople were engaged with the app.", "How to Measure Metrics\nThe most common way you\u2019ll measure metrics is by adding bits of code into\nyour product to measure customer behavior, and to automatically collect the\nindividual measurements into an analytics tool, like Google Analytics.\nUsually these measurements are very simple: How many people uploade d a\nfile? How many people clicked this button? How much time did a person\nspend looking at a web page  or a screen in an app?  Early on when planning\na product, you\u2019ll want to think about what metrics you want to capture and\nwork with your development team to capture those metrics (Chapter 5). For\nlegal reasons, customers often have to opt in to providing this analytics data,\nwhich is why you frequently see disclosures in usage term sheets or pop-ups\nin software alerting customers that you\u2019re collecting usage data for a product.\nHowever, not every metric gets captured automatically. It\u2019s tough to know\nfrom an automated tool whether customers like your product or swear at it\nmultiple times a day when they use it. If your long-term goal is for customers\nto love your product, what should you do? Companies frequently use surveys\nand interviews to sample groups of customers and gauge these higher-level\nmetrics. Sometimes these surveys are automated, such as a pop-up asking how\nyou like the app on  a scale from 1 to 10.\nNet Promoter Score\u00ae\nThe Net Promoter Score (NPS) is a metric developed by Satmetrix, Bain &\nCo., and Fred Reichheld. It\u2019s a high-level way to gauge overall customer\nsatisfaction with your product by seeing how likely customers are to\nrecommend it to others, on a scale from \u2013100 to 100. The idea is that if\ncustomers love your product, they\u2019ll tell others about it. If they\u2019re ambivalent,\nthey could switch to a competitor. And if they dislike it, they might tell others", "to stay away and cost you business.\nNPS is measured by asking customers, \u201cOn a scale of 1\u201310, how likely is it\nthat you would recommend [brand] to a friend or colleague?\u201d Promoters rank\nyour brand 9 or 10 and are \u201cloyal enthusiasts who will keep buying and refer\nothers, fueling growth.\u201d These are the people you want! Passives will rank\nyou 7 or 8 and are \u201csatisfied but unenthusiastic customers who are vulnerable\nto competitive offerings.\u201d Detractors score you from 0 to 6 and \u201care unhappy\ncustomers who can damage your brand and impede growth through negative\nword-of-mouth.\u201d\nFrom those replies, the NPS is the percentage of promoters minus the\npercentage of detractors, giving you a score from \u2013100 to 100. Reichheld, in\nhis 2003 article about NPS, entitled \u201cThe One Number You Need to Grow,\u201d\nfound that many companies\u2019 NPS were low, with a median being 16 across\n400 companies, showing that a lot of companies have work to do to improve\ncustomer satisfaction!\nMeasuring NPS over time is a way to see how customers are reacting to the\nproduct changes you make (or don\u2019t make). If your company\u2019s goal is\ncustomer satisfaction, with NPS as your success metric, and your NPS is\nlower than you\u2019d like, then your immediate product goals will be around\nimproving your customers\u2019 happiness. We\u2019ll dig into how to figure out what\nchanges to make to improve customer satisfaction in Chapters 3 and 4.\nWhew\u2014for such a simple concept, there\u2019s sure a lot to success metrics. But\nthey are incredibly important to product managers, as they let us figure out if\nour product and the strategy we\u2019re taking are meeting our short- and long-term\ngoals.\nWHAT ELSE HAS BEEN, IS BEING, AND WILL BE", "BUILT?\nUnfortunately you can\u2019t look at a product or a company in complete isolation\naround this moment in time. What the company did in the past likely has an\nimpact on where it is now. Microsoft completely missed the start of the\nmobile era, and that has led to its drive now to be \u201cmobile-first, cloud-first.\u201d\nIt\u2019s also worth thinking about where a product might go next. While\nsometimes you\u2019ll build a product by releasing it to customers, getting\nfeedback, and reacting to customer demand, you\u2019ll also often need to think\nabout the long term to support overall company strategic initiatives. What do\nyou want to do in three months, in six months, or in two years that you need to\nlay the groundwork for today? Maybe your product is free right now but your\ncompany wants to add a subscription payment system\u2014your customers aren\u2019t\nasking to pay you each month, but your company needs to generate revenue to\nsurvive. You\u2019ll need to do work now so that you can handle billing\ninformation later.\nRoadmap\nCompanies generally collect their product plans into a roadmap. A roadm ap\nis a document that shows what the company/product is doing now, what the\ncompany/product plans to do over the next N months, what the\ncompany/product plans to do later, roughly how much effort each high-level\ntask will take, what products the company will create, and what features they\nwill have, etc. It\u2019s a valuable tool to help people communicate about the\ncompany, both internally by helping employees understand what projects\nyou\u2019re working on next, and externally by helping partners anticipate your\nneeds or plan for products you\u2019re releasing, a situation common with\nhardware-component providers.", "Roadmaps are often fairly detailed in the short term\u2014short term being 3 to 6\nmonths for most software, 6 to 12 months for large software projects, and 12\nto 18 months for hardware\u2014and become more vague over the long term. This\nhappens over the long term because priorities can change, and it\u2019s not worth\nplanning out details for things that might not happen. Just knowing you want to\nwork on something at a high level is sufficient.\nCompanies and products will have related roadmaps. The company-level\none defines how all the products come together, and the product one\u2014\nobviously\u2014focuses on each specific product. Company roadmaps are\ngenerally determined by senior executives at a company, such as the CEO or\nthe head of product. Product roadmaps are created by the product\u2019s PMs, and\nare often influenced by and exert influence over the company roadmap.\nThe factors we discussed at the very beginning of this chapter, in the \u201cWhat\nProduct Are We Building?\u201d section, affect the roadmap, too. The best\nroadmaps are ones where the company has set goals to achieve and then\nplanned projects that will help it achieve those goals. These roadmaps will\nalso provide the sense of the ownership needed for each project, and\ndetermine the order in which the projects should happen. The next chapters\nwill cover how we find oppor tunities and how items end up on the roadmap,\nbut for now simply know that roadmaps are not arbitrary.\nRoadmaps take many forms. Sometimes they\u2019re a spreadsheet using colors to\nshow all the scheduled projects, their timeframes, and what goal each project\nsupports. Other times companies use a special tool like Aha! (http://aha.i o)\nthat has additional features, such as bug-tracking integration with Jira so that\nyou can dig into specific details like how each bug relates to the roadmap. It\ndoesn\u2019t matter what tool you use to create your roadmap\u2014it matters that you\nhave a roadmap.", "There\u2019s one major risk with roadmaps\u2014you don\u2019t know the future, and if\nyour plans change someone might ask you later on why you didn\u2019t deliver an\nitem on the roadmap. Keeping roadmaps up to date and keeping items further\nout intentionally vague\u2014even if you have more accurate timing estimates\u2014\ncan help alleviate this issue.\nCompetition and Climate\nThe last element to think about when trying to understand a company is what\u2019s\ngoing on around that company: What are other people building? Who are the\ncompany \u2019s main competitors? How are their target use cases, personas , and\nend customers different? How are their produc ts different? How are they\nwinning or losing compared to another company ? Are you aware of who\u2019s\nout there?\nAt Product School, we had a student who cofounded a service focused on\nhelping schools book  their facilities for other events. Originally, he and his\ncompany were not aware of any other competitors. However, while the\nstudent was in class and working on his final project, he discovered that\nanother company had pivoted from focusing on broader book ing services to\nfocusing specifically on schools. While this was validation that there\u2019s an\noppor tunity with the use cases his company was targeting and it focused on\ndelivering a better product than its competitors, it stressed him out knowing\nthat his company wasn\u2019t the only one playing in that space anymore!\nBeyond competition, what\u2019s going on in the industry in general? Has some\nbroader invention or change caused every company to drastically alter its\nplans? For example, as smartwatches become popu lar, many companies are\nracing to create their own watches or versions of their apps for watches. And\nwith Google Chrome now blocking Flash ads, ad tech companies are forced", "to adjust their plans to deal with this change.\nBroader world changes can impact a company, too. China devalued its\ncurrency in August 2015, possibly to keep its manufacturing rates attractive,\nand that has had an impact on revenue for companies that sell in China. It also\nmight have had an influence any company looking to build its products in\nVietnam.\nThe world, and especially technology, doesn\u2019t stand still! A great PM will\nstay on top of the news to make sure that her company doesn\u2019t fall by the\nwayside because it missed a broader force that changed!\nA 5C ANALYSIS\nIf you\u2019ve ever talked with consultants or MBAs, you probably heard them\nname-drop a framework or seven. There is a variety of \u201cstandard\u201d\nframeworks in the business world\u2014w e say \u201cstandard\u201d because there are\nmany similar frameworks, and different companies pick different standards.\nWe\u2019ll cover some common ones in this book , but we will always prioritize\npresenting things with a product focus, even if it means we don\u2019t use a\nframework.\nThere\u2019s a framework called 5C that\u2019s similar to the areas we just covered.\nIt\u2019s a situational framework, meaning it helps you understand a company\u2019s\ncurrent situation so that you can create an oppor tunity hypothesis. The 5C\nstructure is generic\u2014useful to product, marketing, and more\u2014whereas the\nway we presented the sections in this chapter is very focused on product\nmanagement. It\u2019s good to know what the \u201cC\u201ds stand for because you\u2019ll likely\nhear 5C mentioned. Plus if you need to do a  situational analysis on your feet in\na meeting or interview, it\u2019s relatively easy to remember.\nCompany: This refers to the company\u2019s experience, technology, culture,", "goals, and more. It\u2019s similar to the material we covered in the \u201cWhy Does\nthe Company Exist?,\u201d \u201cHow Do We Know If Our Product\u2019s Good? ,\u201d and\n\u201cWhat Else Has Been, Is Being, and Will Be Built?\u201d sections.\nCustomers: Who are the people buying this product? What are the market\nsegments? How big are they? What are people\u2019s goals with buying this\nproduct? How do they make buying decisions? Where do they buy this type\nor product? This is similar to what we covered in the \u201cCustomers and\nPersonas\u201d and \u201cUse Cases\u201d sections.\nCollaborators: Who are the external people who make the product possible,\nincluding distributors, suppliers, logistical operators, groundwork support\npersonnel, and so on?\nCompetitors: Who is competing for your customers\u2019 money? This includes\nactual and potential competitors. You should look at how they position their\nproduct, the market size they address, their strengths and weaknesses, and\nmore.\nClimate: These are the macro-environmental factors, like cultural,\nregulatory, or technological trends and innovations.\nSometimes product managers add a \u201cP\u201d to the 5C structure for \u201cproduct,\u201d and\nspecifically call out the product(s) the company makes. This is a mix of what\nwe covered in the \u201cWhat Else Has Been, Is Being, and Will Be Built?,\u201d \u201cHow\nDo We Know If Our Product\u2019s Good? ,\u201d and \u201cUse Cases\u201d sections.\nINTRODUCING MOOVER.IO\nThroughout this book , we\u2019ll use a fictional company, Moove r.io, as a case", "study. Let\u2019s look at its company context using the principles in this chapter.\nMoove r was started about a year ago to help people save time\u2014its \u201cwhy\u201d\u2014\ninitially focusing on making it easy to get estimates and book  a move.\nCurrently, Moover has an iOS app where you enter some very basic details\nabout your move: zip codes to and from, date you want to move, packing\nneeds, number of rooms, number of stairs, and any other special notes. You\nclick \u201cSubmit\u201d, and over the next few days, moving companies return bids. If\nyou see one you like, you can tap \u201cBook\u201d, and Moove r sends a note to the\nmoving company, which follows up with a phone call to confirm any needed\ninformation. Moove r charges a small, fixed fee of $10 when you click\n\u201cBook,\u201d using Apple Pay or PayPal. There\u2019s also a simple web dashboard\napp for the moving companies, where they can see outstanding bids with the\nbasic information about the potential customer\u2019s home, along with whether a\ncustomer accepted or rejected the bid.\nMoove r\u2019s target use case is moving from and within bigger cities, as it\u2019s\nworked with only moving companies in San Francisco, New York, Los\nAngles, and Chicago to set up the service.\nMoove r has two key personas. The first is the moving company, Ant Moving.\nAnt is a mid-sized moving company with about 10 crews that has someone in\nthe office who gives estimates over the phone full-time. Ant doesn\u2019t have a\nfull online book ing system set up because it\u2019s easier and cheaper to do things\nby hand. The second persona is Really Busy Rob. Rob\u2019s a busy person who\nlikes using app services to handle the mundane details in life. He prefers Lyft\nto owning a car, orders dinner from Postmates, and more. Rob doesn\u2019t mind\npaying a small fee for these services, as he feels his time outweighs the fee.\nRob works a lot, and having to arrange a move is the last thing on his mind!\nMoove r also learned from interviewing lots of potential \u201cRobs\u201d that Rob", "could easily be \u201cRoberta\u201d because gender doesn\u2019t matter. Rob\u2019s likely been\nout of school for a few years and has accumulated enough stuff that his\npossessions don\u2019t fit into his car anymore, and we won\u2019t find Rob on a\ncollege campus.\nMoove r has two current business goals: to find ways to improve customer\nsatisfaction, and to grow the business. Moove rs currently experiencing\nlimitations that prevent it from reaching this goal, for example, right now that\nfollow-up phone call to plan details is annoying, especially if the moving\ncompany has to come on-site, and Moove r has no way to handle special\ncases, like a piano. The people at Moove r, however, aren\u2019t sure what they\nshould focus on next, nor are they sure if they\u2019re missing an oppor tunity.\nRight now, moving tech isn\u2019t exactly a hot market, and Moove r\u2019s main\ncompetitors are specific companies\u2019 book ing systems and people willing to\nmake a few phone calls\u2014or use a service like Fiverr to have someone make\nthe phone calls for him.\nMoove r just raised $1 million and hired its second product manager: you!\nThroughout this book , we\u2019re going to help Moove r figure out what feature to\nbuild next and walk through how to build it.\n________ \nCHAPTER TWO TIP\nThroughout  this book , to give you an additional perspective, we\u2019ve asked\nexperienced produc t manage rs to share their best advice about  each", "chapter\u2019s topic.\nOur first tip comes from Jeremy Toeman, vice president of produc ts at\nCNET. Jeremy runs CNET\u2019s audience development, engage ment, and social\nmedia teams, and he\u2019s respons ible for building CNET\u2019s multichanne l\nproduc ts, including web, mobile, and apps . Jeremy has more than 20 years\nof experience, including being VP of produc t manage ment at Sling Media;\nworking on Dropcam, Sonos , and Sphe ro; and foundi ng multiple companies\nthat had successful exits. In other words, he knows what he\u2019s talking about !\nHere\u2019s what he has to say about  personas .\nMAKING PERSONAS REAL WITH EMPATHY\nWith ~20 years under my belt, I\u2019ve noticed the consistent trend is for product managers to define\npersonas with 90% demographics, and 10% wants/needs/emotions. Maybe less. For example, it\u2019s easy to\ncreate Jill\u2014a 23-year-old in a major metro who has a roommate, loves travel, and is very into the DJ\nscene. Jill is thinking about buying her first car. That\u2019s a great starting point. But it\u2019s barely the tip of the\niceberg.\nDoes Jill care about what the car says about her, or does she care about fuel efficiency? Is Jill focused\non saving money, or on resale value? Does Jill care about the car tech, or just that it gets her places?\nFurther, does Jill enjoy the research process, or does she just want to be pointed in the right direction? Is\nshe going to make a little comparison spreadsheet for herself, or just wing it?\nFar too often products are coming to market without considering the needs of the individual, as opposed\nto pure demographic fit. All of the above scenarios are valid to a product manager who is designing a\nsite/app to cater to car buyers. But a simple review of car-buying websites shows a distinct lack of\nconsideration for emotional needs versus purely practical ones.\nWhen the TV industry tried to bring 3D technology into the house, they showed a distinct lack of\nempathy. Sure, 3D movies were performing well in theaters, so it made logical sense to bring that kind of\ntech into the home. But an empathic product manager could have easily predicted the poor reception:\nmovie theaters are primarily solitary (though shared) experiences, whereas family/living rooms are\nprimarily social experiences. And no family wants to sit on the couch wearing a bunch of goofy glasses\n(not a problem in a darkened theater).", "Great product managers can put themselves into the mindset of the persona, and really get into his/her\nskin to understand the wants and needs and, most importantly, the emotional triggers of their users. And\ntruly great product managers will cycle through many different personas as they consider the product\u2019s\ncore needs. This process determines the subtle differences that can take good products and transform\nthem into exceptional ones.", "A key part of your role as a product manager is understanding your customers\nand their problems and needs, and making sure what you\u2019re building next is\nright for them, be it a feature or a new product. At the end of the day, very\nfew companies fail because their technology doesn\u2019t work. Companies fail\nfor lack of customers.\nHere\u2019s a dirty secret: everyone thinks they know what their customers need.\nBut like we mentioned in Chapter 1, most people\u2014even your boss\u2019s boss\u2014\nreally have no idea what customers need until they\u2019ve done some work!\nEvery company has a different approach to figuring out what customers want,\nand there are tweets, blog posts, book s, and epic operas about how to do so", "\u2014well, maybe not operas, yet.\nWe\u2019re going to take an approach modeled on the scientific method\u2014c ome\nup with a hypothesis about your customer needs and how you can address\nthem, then validate or invalidate it. This chapter will cover different ways to\ngenerate a hypothesis. Chapter 4 will discuss how to validate it, and Chapter\n5 will help you transition from ideation to execution.\nKeep in mind what we\u2019re teaching you is just one way to approach figuring\nout what to do next, albeit it is a good one. A lot of the content in this chapter\nis a bit chicken-and-egg\u2014some of the material we taught in Chapter 2 comes\ninto play here, as does future material from the Customer Development\nsection of Chapter 4. C ustomer development can influence your personas, use\ncases can inform oppor tunities, and so on. Rather than debate ad nauseam\nwhere to start, we\u2019ve chosen an approach. We encourage you to keep a\nsimilar mental model, based on the scientific method, no matter where you\nstart, so that you\u2019re always making informed decisions about what to do n ext.\nYOU HAVE OPINIONS, NOT FACTS\nThere\u2019s some bad news you should know up front. Generally, less than 50%\nof ideas you\u2019ll execute\u2014even awesome ideas\u2014improve the metrics they\u2019re\nsuppos ed to improve. Amazon tests all its new ideas and has data to back up\nthis 50% figure. Yammer follows a similar practice and has seen similar\nnumbers. As a product manager, you want to find ways to spend your time on\nfeatures that matter. This starts with accepting that your ideas start off as\nopinions and not facts.\nIt\u2019s sometimes very hard for product managers to grasp that their opinions\nare not necessarily truth. We like being right, and we\u2019re taught in school that\nit\u2019s bad to be wrong. The real world\u2014a nd building products\u2014isn\u2019t like that.", "It\u2019s OK to be wrong, but we want to figure out if we\u2019re wrong as soon as\npossible and course-correct before we put lots of resources into our\nincorrect opinions. If you\u2019re wrong but insist you\u2019re right, the product will\nfail. But if you\u2019re wrong, realize it quickly, and adjust accordingly, you\u2019re\nmuch more likely to succeed.\nHow often has someone said to you, \u201cI have a million-dollar idea for a\nproduct that does x,\u201d and the voice inside your head answers, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t\nbuy it.\u201d Lots of people have opinions about what product or feature to build.\nEveryone assumes they\u2019re average, and that if they want something, lots of\nother people do, too. Because of this, many people go immediately from an\nidea right to building it, never once seeing if others would actually buy the\nproduct. Early-stage startups frequently have this problem\u2014these are also\noften the startups that eschew product management. Unfortunately, these\ncompanies end up in trouble because after spending lots of money to build a\nproduct, they find out no one wants it. As a result, bad things happen, ranging\nfrom their abandoning the product without recouping their investment to\ngoing out of business.\nWouldn\u2019t it be great if you could limit these disaster scenarios in a cost-\neffective way? The approach we\u2019re going to teach you, focused on creating\nand validating an idea, will let you quickly and cheaply filter out ideas that\nwon\u2019t help you. Note we\u2019re not talking about \u201cbad\u201d ideas\u2014an idea could be\ngood bu t just not help you or your customers.\nSteve Blank, a tech entrepreneur, worked with a number of startups and\nnoticed a trend in the ones that failed. Specifically, these startups would\nfocus on their business plans and go right to product development, skipping\nany validation of their fundamental idea\u2014sound familiar? By the time a\nstartup would get feedback from customers, it would be so far down a path", "that it\u2019d be tough to make changes. Blank noticed that startups failed mainly\ndue to lack of customers and a profitable business model, and the ones he\nworked with and their investors didn\u2019t see value in taking time to figure out if\npeople really wanted what they were building. Ironically, this disconnect\nwas especially an issue for the startups\u2019 founders, who created the initial\nhypothesis the company was founded on. They quickly became isolated from\ndirect customer feedback, as they hired people such as marketers to interact\nwith customers for them.\nBlank\u2019s work led him to conclude that \u201cin a startup no facts exist inside the\nbuilding; only opinions.\u201d He then created the idea of customer development,\nwhich essentially says that whatever you come up with at first is an opinion;\nyou might be wrong, and you need to interact with real potential customers to\nlearn the truth ASAP. This chapter is about forming a good opinion. Chapter\n4 is about how to find out the truth about your opinion.\nCustomer development became a core part of lean methodology, which we\nbriefly mentioned in Chapter 1. Lean Startup is a business that applies a\nproduct developmental methodology, adapted by Steve Blank and Eric Ries\nfrom Toyota\u2019s revolutionary manufacturing pipeline, to product/software\ndevelopment. Lean Startup is focused on helping companies be successful by\nquickly and iteratively determining what customers want, building something\nthat fills only that need, va lidating the solution, and repeating.\nCustomer development is a key part of Lean Startup because it\u2019s a way to\nquickly increase your learning, so as to avoid wasting time. We believe this\napproach is useful both in startups trying to develop their initial product and\nin established companies improving existing products. After all, a great PM\nneeds to help the customer be awesome, and you want to focus your time on\nbuilding things they need!", "With this in mind, how do you create the best possible hypothesis about\nwhat your customers want?\nWHAT\u2019S YOUR GOAL AND HOW DO YOU WANT TO\nACHIEVE IT?\nThe very first thing to establish is your goal for this product development life\ncycle iteration. Is your company focused on acquiring new users? Does it\nwant to improve revenue? There\u2019s no silver bullet to pick the right goal to\nfocus on\u2014if you\u2019ve achieved a core set of engaged customers who\ncontinuously use your product, perhaps your next goal will be revenue,\nfollowed by growth. Your main priority is to pick a specific goal. What you\npick to work on next will be in service of this goal, and this is the core of\nhow PMs strategically choose what to work on next.\nNext, you need to think about how to achieve that high-level goal with an\nactual product. How do you want to achieve that goal at a high level? Do you\nwant to iterate on an existing product, finding ways to improve it? Do you\nwant to build something completely new\u2014a blue-sky oppor tunity, also\nsometimes called blue water or ocean? In making this decision you can focus\nyour thinking so that you can determine the details about what to build to\nachieve your goal.\nLet\u2019s look at iteration first. Start by translating your higher-level business\ngoal into a product goal, then focus on what changes we can make to a\nproduct to help meet that goal. For example, the company might want\nimproved customer satisfaction, which could translate into \u201cgetting\ncustomers to read more articles\u201d because that\u2019s a sign customers like the\ncontent.\nAnother example of using iteration to achieve a goal is when Facebook", "changed the Like button to have different types of reactions, such as love,\nsadness, and anger. Facebook \u2019s goal might have been to get more\nengagement, and the Facebook  PMs implicitly knew they wanted to improve\nthe core product rather than build something new. They decided to provide\nusers with more post-feedback reactions\u2014liking a post about someone\u2019s dog\ndying never seemed like the right reaction, and some users probably chose to\npost nothing rather than like the post. The sad reaction now provides an easy\nway to give the poster feedback, leading to more engagement on posts.\nIterations aren\u2019t just small changes, though. An iteration might be a\ncomplete overhaul or rewrite of the app or a feature, like when Gmail redid\nits \u201cCompose\u201d interface or when Apple switched from skeuomorphism to flat\ndesign in iOS 7. The key definition of an iterative change is that you\u2019re taking\nan existing product and making it better.\nIteration is incredibly important, as the first version of a product is never\nperfect for all customers, and it\u2019s through iteration that a product evolves to\nbecome something customers love. If you don\u2019t have product/market fit yet,\nwe\u2019d recommend focusing on achieving it before trying to focus on revenue\nor growth goals. What is also nice about iteration is that you already have\ninformation about how the customers are using the product, and your\nhypothesis about what to do next might come from quantitative sources (like\nhow many users complain about a bug), or qualitative sources (like ideas the\nsupport team has).\nThe downside to iteration is that you can get stuck finding the \u201clocal\nmaxima.\u201d This means that you\u2019ve optimized something really well, but you\nfocused so much on optimization that you missed a bigger shift that happened.\nThink about Blockbuster Video. Blockbuster could\u2019ve spent lots of time\niterating and come up with the ideal balance of price and rental days/late", "fees. It might have also iterated on the overall store experience, aiming to\noptimize number of rentals per customer, and come up with an in-store\nrecommendation tool to optimize customer satisfaction, ensuring that every\ncustomer walked out with a movie. However, it still would\u2019ve gone out of\nbusiness because it missed the global change where customers switched to\nstreaming video. This is where blue-sky thinking comes into play.\nA blue-sky oppor tunity is something totally new. The biggest blue-sky\nexamples occur when you believe the market/world is changing in a certain\nway, and you need to make a big transformation to address a need that might\nnot exist yet but you believe will exist in the future. While maybe you could\nmake changes to your existing product to address this oppor tunity, this new\noppor tunity is different enough that it\u2019s best addressed by building something\nnew, designing from the ground up to take advantage of that oppor tunity.\nBlue-sky oppor tunities also arise when you see a new oppor tunity to expand\nyour business into areas it doesn\u2019t serve right now because you believe those\nareas will have future value.\nTo put it simply, blue-sky oppor tunities are about skating to where the puck\nwill be, not where it is now. Sometimes blue-sky oppor tunities arise by\nthinking more broadly or reframing how you\u2019re approaching a problem:\nBlockbuster saw its business as \u201cvideo stores\u201d and was locked into handing\ncustomers tapes and DVDs. Netflix focused on \u201ccontent delivery,\u201d and it\ndidn\u2019t matter if that content came from the mail or streaming video. By\nthinking about how to let customers watch movies and TV shows in a\ndifferent way, Netflix saw a means to exceed Blockbuster\u2019s local maxima\nand find a new global maxima.\nAnother example of reframing to find a blue-sky oppor tunity is the life-\ninsurance company MetLife. The company made an app, Infinity, to create", "your digital legacy by curating your memories. Digital legacies are becoming\nfar more of an issue than they were even 10 years ago. Your life-insurance\ncompany is the one business that knows for sure if you\u2019re alive, so who\nbetter to trust with the key to passing on your photos, documents, and more\nwhen you die?\nSometimes, new technology and trends, like cloud computing, change how\nwe solve problems, creating new oppor tunities. Looking at photo\nmanagement; we\u2019ve moved from physical albums to digital tools such as\niPhoto. But even after iPhoto had been out for about 15 years\u2014an eternity for\ntechnology\u2014Apple decided the future of photo management was in the cloud.\nRather than try to make iPhoto capable of managing a cloud-based photo\nlibrary, Apple deprecated iPhoto in favor of an entirely new product, Photos.\nUnlike iPhoto, Photos was built from the ground up for iOS, since most\npeople take their photos with a smartphone rather than a digital camera.\nAnother example of new technology creating blue-sky oppor tunities is when\nFacebook , recognizing the potential of virtual reality (VR), spent $2 billion\nto purchase Oculus, believing that the future value of Oculus\u2019 VR and its\nmetaverse, to connect everyone together, would be huge and more than justify\nthat price.\nThe downside to blue-sky thinking is the potential risk. Blue-sky thinking\nalways requires a guess\u2014even if it\u2019s a well-educated one\u2014about what is\ngoing to happen, and developing blue-sky products takes resources away\nfrom iterating on existing products with real customers. New products almost\nalways lose money at first because in addition to taking resources to\ndevelop, you must convince customers to use this new tool, causing key\nmetrics will be lower at first.\nThis risk factor is where the \u201cinnovator\u2019s dilemma\u201d comes from. It\u2019s hard", "for incumbent companies to justify trying to build the next big thing when they\ncould be spending their money growing their current product, finding the\nlocal maxima. This leads companies to focus too much on their short-term\ngoals, missing larger oppor tunities because of the short-term drop in profits\nthat would result. After all, their current business is doing well: why change?\nFor this reason, private startups that can find a new oppor tunity stand a\nchance of disrupting an incumbent\u2014did anyone expect taxis to be as\ndisrupted as they have been by the smartphone-app-based business model\nand the sharing economy?\nOf course, big companies don\u2019t want to be disrupted, so they\u2019re also often\ntrying to find blue-sky oppor tunities. Alphabet is a great example of how a\nbig company can address the innovator\u2019s dilemma\u2014most of Alphabet\u2019s\nrevenue comes from Google search ads. If the company just sat around,\noptimizing that revenue, it\u2019d have a few really great years. But Alphabet\nknows that business model won\u2019t last forever, and it would rather find the\nnext big thing before someone else does. Alphabet is constantly trying to\ncome up with the next big thing, and some of its work\u2014such as self-driving\ncars\u2014looks promising but hasn\u2019t paid off yet, whereas other investments\ndidn\u2019t work out as well as Alphabet hoped\u2014like buying Boston Dynamics.\nUnfortunately, if you follow Alphabet stock, you\u2019ll see that investors don\u2019t\nlike all these experimental bets\u2014they want to see choices that give\nimmediate returns.\nIf you have an existing product, it\u2019s totally reasonable if your first\noppor tunity hypothesis focuses on iteration rather than blue-sky\nimprovements. But as you work to validate your hypothesis, you might\nrealize the best way to achieve your goals and address your customers\u2019 needs\nis by building something new.", "Thus far, you should have established a high-level company goal, translated\nthat goal to a product goal with key success metrics (why you\u2019re making this\nchange), and thought about if you want to accomplish your goal by changing\nyour existing product or building something new (how you\u2019re going to\naccomplish your goal). Now let\u2019s look at how we come up with what\nspecifically we can do to accomplish our goal.\nQUANTITATIVELY FINDING AN OPPORTUNITY\nHYPOTHESIS\nThere are two major ways to determine what we want to do to achieve our\ngoal: qualitative reasoning, and quantitative reasoning. Quantitative\nreasoning involves looking at data, interpreting it, and using that analysis to\ndetermine what to do next. Qualitative reasoning involves more abstract\nconcepts like looking at your overall product vision or your intuition based\non your knowledge of your customers in determining the next step to take.\nWe\u2019ll look at quantitative reasoning first because it\u2019s the most common way\nPMs determine what to build next.\nQuantitative sources are important because they allow us to collect data on\nhow people actually use our product, to use that data to find insights, and then\nto apply those insights to determine what to do next. For example, perhaps\nLyft wants to increase customer retention by getting people to use Lyft instead\nof Uber. We can turn that into a specific product goal by focusing on how to\ndecrease the number of rides cancelled\u2014fewer cancellations means more\npassengers served and happier drivers, which means more payment. This\nwill also come by tweaking the current product, rather than building\nsomething new. When you cancel a ride in Lyft, you need to specify a reason.\nA PM at Lyft could look at the responses and come up with ideas about how", "to mitigate those reasons. Maybe he notices that midday the number of people\ncancelling their rides due to wait times skyrockets compared to the morning\nor evening. As a result, perhaps he\u2019d find ways to incentivize drivers to be\non the road midday, decreasing wait times, decreasing cancellations, and\nultimately keeping customers in a Lyft rather than an Uber.\nQuantitative sources are also nice because, after we\u2019ve come up with and\nimplemented our idea, we can compare the data before and after the change,\nand determine if it was successful. Our Lyft PM would compare the\npercentage of rides being cancelled and the reasons why to see if his change\ndecreased the number of cancellations.\nIt\u2019s worth noting that quantitative sources are useful for both iterative and\nblue-sky oppor tunities, as are qualitative sources. Data on how customers\nuse your current product might yield ways you can iterate the current product,\nor they could point out a trend that reveals an oppor tunity for a blue-sky\nproject.\nMetrics and Analytics\nHow do you know what to do if you don\u2019t know what your customers are\ndoing? As we\u2019ve discussed before, metrics are measurements of different\ntasks users do within your product. Metrics are the most common source of\nquantitative data about your product and your customers.\nMetrics take many forms, from \u201cHow many people do you swipe right or\nleft on per session in this app?\u201d to \u201cHow many people who came to your site\nvia a specific affiliate\u2019s link completed a purchase?\u201d In Chapters 1 and 2 we\ntalked about success metrics, which are the key indicators of if you\u2019re\nachieving your goals and if your customers are winning. When working with\nmetrics, start by asking yourself if you\u2019re happy with where your success", "metric is\u2014is it at the right level to effectively achieve your product goal, and\nif not, how can you improve this success metric?\nNot every metric is a success metric. For example, our key success metric\nmight be how many people complete a purchase, but we\u2019ll also measure how\nmany people add items to a cart and how many people tap the checkout\nbutton.\nPut together, these metrics give us a sense of what\u2019s going on\ncomprehensively with the product. If lots of people tap the checkout button\nbut very few actually complete a purchase, then we might have an\noppor tunity to improve the checkout workflow so that more people complete\na purchase. Workflows are often called funne ls, and are great sources of\noppor tunity hypotheses\u2014we\u2019ll cover them shortly.\nWe call the process of gathering and analyzing these metrics collectively\nanalytics. Analytics let you understand the state of your product, giving you a\nmuch better idea about what your customers are doing and how your\nproduct\u2019s working for them. Analytics make metrics useful by giving them\ncontext, allowing you to discover insights about what to do n ext.\nThink about metrics as individual data points, such as a car\u2019s position, how\nfast it\u2019s traveling, the number of passengers, etc. In addition to seeing a\nsuccess metric, like \u201cthe user turned the car off after driving for a while,\u201d\nanalytics put those data points together to help you realize the family\u2019s taking\ntheir weekly drive to Grandma\u2019s house. Analytics also let you see if the\nfamily made it to Grandma\u2019s or if they ran out of gas. If the family constantly\nruns out of gas before achieving their goal of getting to Grandma\u2019s, you as a\nPM will look for ways to help them not run out of gas. OK, this metaphor\u2019s\nrun out of gas. Let\u2019s move on.\nAnalytics and metrics are useful for several reasons. The first is that people", "often aren\u2019t aware of exactly what they do, and numerous studies have shown\nthat self-reporting usage is unreliable. Automatically recording their actions\nlets us see what people are really doing with our product and how they got\nthere.\nIf your product is very large, analytics can reveal a problem on one specific\nsection that you might not find manually. Imagine if you were a PM at\nAmazon, and you wanted to watch how many people bought each product. If\npeople stop buying various products, that\u2019s a warning you should look at the\nproduct to see what\u2019s up. If you asked everyone what they bought, you\u2019d have\nan impossible task because of the customer volume. If you randomly\nsurveyed people, you\u2019d likely miss many niche products. Automated\nanalytics, however, could easily find a product where the number purchased\nsuddenly droppe d from an average of five per day to zero.\nFinally, when you look at analytics over time, you can get a gauge for where\nyou\u2019re going. Perhaps your growth rate has leveled off. If you\u2019re unhappy\nwith your trajectory, you\u2019ll dig into the component metrics to find the\nproblem, and determining a way to address that problem will form your\noppor tunity hypothesis. Again, after you\u2019ve implemented the solution, you\ncan re-evaluate these metrics to see if your strategy worked.\nThere are many analytics tools, with Google Analytics (Figure 3-1) and\nMixpanel being two of the most popu lar for web and mobile apps. Adding\nthese tools to your product is fairly straightforward and just requires a bit of\ntracking code and annotations so that you can track specific things, such as\nhow many times a user clicks Play on a video. Physical products often\nrequire completely different analytics techniques, but as more physical\nproducts become connected, it\u2019s possible to collect similar usage data.", "Figure 3-1. A sample screen from Google Analytics showing how often various events, the metrics\nwe\u2019re analyzing, occur over time.\nIt\u2019s worth noting that analytics data isn\u2019t always perfect, and those\nimperfections can skew your analysis. If your app supports multiple\nplatforms, the event might accidentally be tagged as \u201ceventA\u201d on Android\nand \u201cevent A\u201d on iOS. This means you won\u2019t see the total times Event A\nhappens unless you notice the problem and account for it.\nOther times, there are inherent issues in your analytics tools. Google\nAnalytics only samples a subset of your traffic for its reports, but for high-\ntraffic websites that sample might not accurately represent your real data. If\nthe data doesn\u2019t correctly represent what your customers are doing, you might\nmake the wrong decisions.\nLet\u2019s dig into how to use analytics to look at specific metrics and find", "oppor tunities.\nBreaking Down Analytics\nThe first part of analytics is to make sure we\u2019re capturing the right metrics.\nIdentify the key success metric supporting your goal and the metrics that\nsupport that goal. If your success metric is how engaged your customers are,\nyou should track how often they complete the core \u201csuccess\u201d action and the\nsteps that lead to it. If the right metrics aren\u2019t there, then your first task for\nthis iteration of the product-development life cycle is to implement analytics\nfor those metrics.\nOne common problem when you inherit an existing project is that a\nprevious, well-meaning PM has been recording every single possible metric.\nThis leads to data overload, and it can be very hard to sort out the useful\nmetrics from the irrelevant ones. If you find yourself in that situation, we\nrecommend doing an analytics audit and reassessing what data points you\u2019re\nrecording\u2014removing the irrelevant ones\u2014be fore using the data to make\ndecisions.\nThe next part is how we group metrics together so that we can spot trends\nand oppor tunities. There are three key ways: segmentation, cohort analysis,\nand funnels.\nAnalytics track every customer equally and report the average behavior.\nFor example, a new customer will use an app\u2019s first-use tutorial\u2014some\nmight skip it\u2014but a returning customer won\u2019t even see the first-use tutorial.\nIf you simply looked at how often a customer views the tutorial out of how\nmany times people use the app, it\u2019d look like very few people use the tutorial\noverall. It\u2019s up to you to segment your data, which means grouping it by\ncommon characteristics.", "Analytics tools often provide multiple ways to segment data. Common\nchoices range from technical grouping (OS, browser, etc.) to behavioral\n(new/returning user) to demographics (country/language are common). After\nsegmenting data, we can look at each metric, focusing on our key success\nmetric and the supporting metrics, and see if it\u2019s in line with our baseline\nexpectation. If it\u2019s not, we\u2019ll flag this as a metric to focus on.\nYou might find something surprising for a metric unrelated to what you\u2019re\nworking on right now. Feel free to note it for later, but don\u2019t worry about it\ninitially. There are lots of metrics for a product, and PMs can always find\nsurprises. We\u2019re focused on a specific success metric and the supporting\nmetrics that lead to that success metric.\nAnother way of grouping data is cohor t analysis. This is very similar to\nsegmentation, but it uses a point in time as a key characteristic of the group\nand is often used to look at behavior over time. For example, imagine your\nproduct\u2019s featured on TV\u2019s Shar k Tank\u2014Dragon\u2019 s Den in the UK\u2014where\nhopeful entrepreneurs pitch their idea to investors. You might want to\ncompare how users who signed up before Shar k Tank aired use the product\ncompared to people who sign up later. And you\u2019d also ask how those\ncohorts\u2019 usage compares after two months, after six months, etc. Or, more\npractically, what\u2019s customer engagement like over time with customers from\nbefore you created the first-use tutorial compared to customers who signed\nup after you implemented the tutorial? If you see a substantial difference in\nbehavior at a certain point, flag that metric.\nThe last common method of grouping data is a funne l. This is when you\nmeasure key steps along a user\u2019s journey towards some task and group them\ntogether, in journey order. Typically a lot of people complete the first step\nand far fewer complete the last; e.g., many people might go to an Amazon", "product page, a smaller number click Add to Cart, and a smaller number still\ncomplete the checkout. \u201cLeakage\u201d is when a customer stops moving forward\nin the funnel.\nNearly any sequential-action group of metrics (workflow) can form a\nfunnel, and your goal is always to look at how a user goes from initiating to\ncompleting an action. Not every customer enters your product the same way\n(e.g., tapping an app on the home screen to open it the first time, opening the\napp for the tenth time with a restored state, tapping a link that opens the app,\netc.). Your analytics tool likely has a behavior flow report to see how users\nenter the funnel and where they go. Any place there\u2019s a substantial undesired\nfalloff is a potential oppor tunity, and you should flag that particular metric.\nDave McClure, the well-known venture capitalist who founded 500\nStartups, put together a talk called \u201cStartup Metrics for Pirates,\u201d where he\ncame up with a general approach to metrics for an entire product, called\nAARRR metrics\u2014although he put it together for startups, where the success\nof a company depends on one product, it\u2019s useful for any product. The\nacronym stands for the following:\nAcquisition: How the user comes to your product.\nActivation: The user\u2019s first visit to your product and her first happy\nexperience.\nRetention: The user liked your product enough to use it again (and\nhopefully again and again\u2026).\nReferral: The user likes it enough to tell someone about it.\nRevenue: The user finds your product valuable enough that she pays\nfor it.", "McClure suggests breaking down the key behavioral steps for your product\ninto these buckets (each bucket might have more than one metric within it)\nand using this funnel to see how users go from discovering your product to\nbeing willing to pay. Each large dip is a potential oppor tunity and a metric to\nflag, and the ones towards the top of  the funnel are the ones to address first.\nNote that the part(s) of the funnel you focus on will depend on your\ncompany and product goals. If your current goal is growth, you\u2019d focus on the\nactivation step rather than the revenue step.\nIt\u2019s also important to note that not every dip in a funnel is bad. For example,\nthe Nigerian spam emails asking you to provide your bank account to a\nprince (or something similar) have only a 0.1%  click-through rate\u2014meaning\nonly 0.1%  of the people who receive it click the Send Money link. But this\nturns out to be an excellent filter for gullible customers, as 70% of the people\nwho click the link actually send money. If they optimized the click-through\nrate and 90% of people clicked the link, it\u2019s more likely that the site would\nbe reported or taken dow n, and the spammer would make less money overall.\nIt\u2019s also reasonable to combine segmentation and cohort analysis and\nfunnels. For example, you might want to look at a funnel with cohort analysis\nif your product were featured on Shar k Tank. You could track how many\npeople went from clicking the checkout button to completing the purchase\nbefore you went on Shar k Tank, compared to how many people complete the\ncheckout funnel after you were on TV.\nUltimately, no matter how you look at your analytics, your goal is to find a\nmetric you believe is worth improving in order to achieve your product and\ncompany goals.\nTurning Metrics into Opportunities by Asking Why", "The challenge with quantitative sources like metrics is that they tell you what\nis happening but not why. Once you\u2019ve identified a metric\u2014or two\u2014that you\nwant to improve, how do you figure out what to do? There are a few ways to\nfigure out what you should do, and one of the easiest is by asking \u201cwhy.\u201d\nSpecifically, ask yourself why you think the metric isn\u2019t where you want it to\nbe. And if the answer isn\u2019t a hypothesis that you can test somehow, continue\nto ask yourself why until you get to a specific hypothesis. Your goal is to get\nto the core problem, the root of the deeper issue. You want to solve\nproblems, not address symptoms. Asking why can help you find that core\nproblem, leading you to the potential oppor tunity to focus on validating.\nHere are a few ideas to help you. First, many people only focus on the end\nresult of the funnel. They might say, \u201cNot enough customers complete a\npurchase.\u201d If this is the case, ask yourself why. Look back up through the\nfunnel and see where the leakage occurs. Then, ask why it\u2019s occurring there.\nYou might need to go to that particular part of the product to see what might\nbe blocking a user.\nSegmenting your audience and focusing in on how each segment behaves\ncan lead to a better hypothesis. For example, perhaps your site\u2019s conversion\nrate looks low overall, but when you segment it by browser, you see the\nconversion rate for Safari customers is much higher than for Chrome\ncustomers. Given there are more Chrome customers than Safari ones, the\noverall average conversion rate appears low. As you ask yourself why and\ntry using the site in Chrome yourself, maybe you\u2019ll find a bug where a\nJavaScript error appears when you click Checkout in Chrome. Your\noppor tunity hypothesis is that fixing this bug will improve acquisition for the\nshopping cart page, and eventually increase revenue.\nHere are a few common, interesting oppor tunities you\u2019ll find for mobile and", "web apps in metrics:\nA low time on a screen and a high bounce rate\u2014pe ople who leave\nafter viewing this content\u2014on  a page that\u2019s suppos ed to be important\nlikely indicates a mismatch between expectations and reality. The\ncontent wasn\u2019t what the customers expected, so they left.\nA long time on a screen and a high bounce rate could be fine if the\npage is a long article, but if it\u2019s a page with very little content but lots\nof links, it could indicate the screen is unclear.\nA high number of screen views could indicate that this part of the app\nis important, therefore you need to opt imize it well.\nA low number of views could mean this section is hard to find.\nIntercom\u2019s Feature Audit\nA company called Intercom, which makes tools to let product owners see\nwho\u2019s using their product and communicate with them, has put together a\nnumber of great resources on its blog, Inside Intercom, at blog.intercom.io.\nOne of the techniques Intercom shares is a way to look at your metrics and\nspot oppor tunities, called a feature audit.\nIn a feature audit, you start by creating a graph of how many people use a\nfeature on the x-axis vs. how often they use it (See Table 3-1). When doing\nthis, make sure to exclude \u201cadministrative\u201d features such as password\nrecovery, as they\u2019ll skew the result. The core value of your product, the\nreason it exists and people buy it, should be at the top right (Feature C)\nbecause everyone should use it all the time.", "Few peopleSome peopleMost peopleAll people\nAll the timeFeature A Feature C\nMost of the time Feature B\nSome of the time Feature D\nVery little of the timeFeature E\nTable 3-1. A sample Intercom feature audit table.\nThere are four sources of oppor tunity:\n1. Features on the top left of the graph are poorly adopted (Feature A in\nTable 3-1): very few people use them a lot. Sometimes that\u2019s OK\u2014\nfor example, if it\u2019s a niche feature for one key customer in an\nenterprise product that only that company uses\u2014bu t often, you\u2019ll want\nto improve adoption of these features.\n2. The second source is a feature that all the people use occasionally\n(Feature D): is it something you want people to use more often?\n3. The third is that perhaps you should kill a feature if it\u2019s something in\nthe bottom left that very few people use, and then only infrequently\n(Feature E).\n4. Last, you might choose to improve a key feature that many people use\nfrequently (Features B & C).\nThis view also shows a possible warning sign: if your product has only one\nfeature that people use frequently, you\u2019re easily replaceable in their\nworkflow. Ideally you\u2019ll have a few key features that people use frequently so\nthat you\u2019re not a throwaway product when something better in one area comes\nalong.\nIf there\u2019s an important feature you believe is for all customers but only some\ncustomers use, you\u2019ll want to improve its adoption. To do so, focus on asking", "why, just like we discussed before. Note that you want to be very explicit\u2014\ndon\u2019t just say, \u201ccustomers don\u2019t see its value.\u201d Keep asking why until you get\nto the root cause. Why don\u2019t they see its value? The feature doesn\u2019t save them\ntime. Why doesn\u2019t it save them time? There are too many steps to use the\nfeature. Why are there too many steps? Eventually, you\u2019ll come up with a list\nof issues preventing customers from adopting the feature (e.g., time saving\nmight be only one of many reasons a customer doesn\u2019t see a feature\u2019s value).\nOnce you\u2019ve done this you can focus on resolving those issues. Not all\noppor tunities will be code changes, either. It\u2019s possible different marketing or\ndesign will help adoption.\nIf there\u2019s a feature that many customers use infrequently but you think would\nbe beneficial if they used it more, it\u2019s possible users aren\u2019t clear how it\nworks, which you can check via a funnel. You can also check the value, with\nthe help of Marketing. To motivate users to use it more, you can use the Hook\nCanvas, by Nir Eyal, author of Hooked, to help create habits in your software.\nSeen in Figure 3-2, the Hook Canvas has four elements. First is the trigger\u2014\nwhat happens to get the user to the product? Second\u2014w hat\u2019s the absolute\nsimplest thing you can get a customer to do that will give them the reward?\nThird\u2014w hat reward can you provide that\u2019s fulfilling and makes the user want\nmore and invest in the product? Last, what tiny bit of action can you get the\ncustomer to invest in doing that will lead to more triggers and get them to\nreturn?", "Figure 3-2. Nir Eyal\u2019s Hook Canvas and its four phases.\nIf you\u2019ve heard of gamification, which involves adding gaming mechanisms\nto non-game products, you\u2019ve seen the Hook Canvas in action. You might get\nan email from an airline saying you\u2019ll get bonus points if you sign up for a\ncredit card. You fill out the simplest form the airline can give you, and\u2014\nassuming you\u2019re approved\u2014y ou get enough points for a free domestic trip.\nThat makes you want to earn more points to get more free trips.\nEyal uses Pinterest as an example in Figure 3-3.\nFigure 3-3. Pinterest\u2019s Hook Canvas, by Nir Eyal.\nSurveys\nAnother way of gathering data to find oppor tunities is by sending out surveys,", "trying to gauge user satisfaction with different parts of your product amongst\nstatistically significant parts of your user base. In Chapter 2 we discussed the\nmost common high-level approach to determining satisfaction, a Net Promoter\nScore (NPS). Again, it\u2019s simply the question, \u201con a scale of 1\u201310, how likely\nis it that you would recommend [brand] to a friend or colleague?\u201d Higher\nscores mean customers are happy and lower scores mean they\u2019re likely to be\nneutral or tell people not to buy your product.\nIt\u2019s good to dive in beyond a general NPS and ask how satisfied customers\nare with specific parts of your product. If they\u2019re less than a 10, h ave an open-\nended question for feedback about how the product isn\u2019t meeting their needs\nand expectations. As you make changes to the product, you can resurvey to see\nhow satisfaction changes over time.\nSome products now are integrating this satisfaction survey into the product.\nFor example, random Twitter customers will see a tweet in their timeline\nsaying they\u2019ve been selected for a survey, and tools like Intercom\n(http://intercom.io), Delighted (http://delighted.com), and UserVoice\n(http://uservoice.com) can be easily integrated and allow customers to\nprovide feedback continuously.\nSurveys can be used to gather more specific data, and we\u2019ll cover crafting\ngood ones in more depth in Chapter 4, when we look at how to use them to\nvalidate our hypothesis.\nObviously, if a customer isn\u2019t satisfied and tells you why, that\u2019s a potential\nsource of an oppor tunity hypothesis. But there are other ways to use survey\ndata to find an opportunity, especially creating an importance vs. satisfaction\ngraph.\nInternally, you should have a sense of how important each feature is to the\nproduct. The features that are core to the product and used most often are", "likely the most important. For each feature, if you create a graph (See Figure\n3-4) with customer satisfaction on the y-axis, increasing feature importance on\nthe x-axis, and an y=x line, you\u2019ll easily spot oppor tunities. An important\nfeature that has low satisfaction will appear below the line, and it should be\nyour first priority to improve.\nFigure 3-4. A graph showing satisfaction, with values gathered via survey, vs. feature importance, as\ndetermined internally. Feature A, with a very low satisfaction, will likely be the first place to focus,\ninstead of Feature B, which is more important but has a moderate satisfaction.\nGenerally, you\u2019ll trade off importance vs. how unsatisfied customers are, so\nyou might work on something that\u2019s fairly important with very low satisfaction\n(Feature A in Figure 3-4) before focusing on a feature that\u2019s very important\nwith moderate satisfaction (Feature B). Also, it\u2019s fine if less important\nfeatures have lower overall satisfaction; they\u2019re not critical to the product.\nShould those features become more important, then you should focus on\nimproving them so that the user satisfaction stays above  the x=y line.\nWhat About Customer Interviews?", "It\u2019s possible that while you\u2019re talking to customers, for example, while user\ntesting another feature, they might say something that sparks an idea in your\nmind. However, we believe that customer interviews should not be the source\nof your first opportunity hypothesis. If you start customer interviews without\neven a vague sense of what you\u2019re looking to learn, the interviews will be\nunfocused and not useful, and you\u2019re unlikely to find a good h ypothesis.\nInstead, we believe you should start with an oppor tunity hypothesis, even if\nit\u2019s vague, and then do customer interviews to validate it. It\u2019s possible that\nwhile doing those interviews, you\u2019ll come up with a new hypothesis, and\nthat\u2019s fine.\nQUALITATIVELY FINDING AN EDUCATED\nOPPORTUNITY HYPOTHESIS\nNot every oppor tunity arises from something that can be quantified and\nmeasured. As Henry Ford suppos edly said, \u201cIf I had asked people what they\nwanted, they would\u2019ve said a faster horse.\u201d Someone else once said that\n\u201cdata-driven optimization taken to its extreme just leads to por n.\u201d\nYou can pull from a wide range of qualitative sources to find opportunities.\nThe biggest challenge is that these will take more work to validate than\nquantitatively found oppor tunities, as they don\u2019t come directly from data:\nyou\u2019ll have to find data to support them.\nKnown Bugs and Sugs\nThe simplest qualitative iterative oppor tunity (which is also arguably\nquantitative) to look for is how a bug might be blocking customers from\nsucceeding. For example, if you\u2019re trying to improve revenue and the QA\nteam discovers that when customers in Europe try to pay, your app crashes\nwhile handling the US-dollar-to-euro rate conversion, then the next thing you", "might choose to work on is fixing that crashing bug.\nThe main way you\u2019ll validate a bug-related oppor tunity hypothesis is by\nlooking for data about how big of an issue the bug is\u2014i.e., how often does it\noccur and what impact does it have on the success metric? Maybe that\nconversion bug hasn\u2019t been reported by any actual users, and it\u2019s really\nsomething in the QA team\u2019s setup causing it. Or, if only a tiny portion of your\ncustomers are in Europe, then there are likely other ways to improve revenue\nyou should focus on first.\nIt might seem silly to explicitly list bugs as an oppor tunity to explore\u2014if\nyou\u2019re an engineer, you\u2019d likely prefer to have no bugs\u2014bu t one of a PM\u2019s\nchallenges is to weigh the overall value of fixing a bug against that of not\nfixing the bug and doing something else instead. Quality\u2019s always important,\nbut not every bug is a high enough priority to go fix immediately.\nSimilarly, there might be existing \u201csugs\u201d or feature requests in your backlog,\nwhich become the basis for your hypothesis. These might have come from a\nvariety of places, ranging from random ideas people have had to data-driven\nsources like customer support tickets and insights from usability studies\u2014\ni.e., studies where you test how real customers interact with the existing\nproduct/feature and note what they do well and what stumbling blocks they\nencounter.\nRelated to this is paying off \u201ctechnical debt.\u201d Sometimes engineering has to\nmake internal changes that essentially \u201cdo the dishes\u201d in the code. It\u2019s\nimportant to periodically prioritize this engineering work because if you\ndon\u2019t, it will become harder and harder to implement new features down the\nroad. Unfortunately, when you work on these projects, from a customer\nperspective nothing changes. To validate this oppor tunity, you\u2019ll want to make\nsure that this is a good time to work on an internal cleanup rather than to", "deliver something new to customers, and that this internal cleanup will\nprovide value to your team down the road, such as making it easier to\nimplement another oppor tunity on the roadmap.\nIntuition\nHow many times have you heard someone say, \u201cI\u2019ve got an idea for an app!\nDo you know anyone who can build it for me?\u201d Sometimes there are good\nideas, like being able to use an app to easily hail a car at an attractive price.\nOther times someone wants to build an app to help match their socks to their\ntrousers. Clearly, no one has good ideas all the time, not even Steve Jobs\u2014\nremember the iPod Sock?\nA common source of oppor tunity hypotheses is existing hypotheses you or\nyour company might already have based on your experience/prior knowledge.\nThis is a great place to start because you likely do have a strong idea of what\nto build for your customers from your experience, but it\u2019s also potentially\ndangerous because this type of hypothesis often doesn\u2019t get validated\nproperly. Many times, people are afraid of someone stealing their idea\u2014\nwhich rarely actually happens\u2014or they just don\u2019t want to find out that no one\nactually wants their idea.\nUnfortunately, the second step for many first-time product builders isn\u2019t to\nvalidate their idea but rather to jump immediately into building it. People like\nto assume that if they have a problem, many other people do too, and these\npeople will want their solution. This is risky because it might be very costly\nto build the product, and no one knows for sure if anyone else experiences this\nsame problem or is interested in the same solution as they are.\nThe best way to come up with an idea on your own is not to think about what\nyou the individual want but to really empathize with your target personas,", "combining your knowledge of your customers\u2019 pain points with your\nknowledge of what you could build and the overall goals and success metrics\nthat matter to the product and the company. As a PM, you\u2019re in a unique\nposition to know what the major pain points for customers are, how they\u2019re\nreacting to your product, what the technical issues are with your product, and\nwhat technical innovations have occurred within your engineering team. We\u2019ll\nshow you a tool, shortly, called the Business Model Canvas, to make the\nsynthesis of this idea more concrete. A great PM will also be paying attention\nto the broader tech world, thinking about how innovations elsewhere might\napply to his product and customers.\nHere\u2019s a simple example of an intuition-derived hypothesis for Moove r.\nThey want to make book ing a move as easy as calling an Uber, so that means\nmaking it simple for moving companies to provide accurate estimates. Photos\ncould help moving companies make accurate estimates, but people likely\ndon\u2019t know how to take useful photos to show a space for moving companies.\nWhat if they added a feature where we had the customer stand in the middle of\neach room, slowly moving their camera up/down as the customer spun around,\ngenerating a 360\u00b0  photo on screen? That way every customer takes a good\nphoto of the space in question.\nWe can hypothesize that the result will make it easier for moving companies\nto give an accurate estimate. The next step would be to validate that photos,\nespecially 360\u00b0  ones, make it substantially easier for moving companies to\nmake accurate estimates. This could be done by using an existing 360\u00b0  app to\ntake photos of a space and send both them and regular photos of a space to\nvarious moving companies, asking for their feedback.\nVision", "You, your boss, your company, etc., likely have an overall vision for your\nproducts and the company that you want to achieve on a longer time horizon.\nSpecifically, it\u2019s an image of the future version of the company you\u2019re trying\nto create. For Walt Disney, this meant looking at some land in Florida and\nhaving a vision of Disney World, knowing that everything he wanted to do\nnext would be about building Cinderella\u2019s castle. For you, maybe you want to\nmigrate from a locally deployed-at-clients solution to a cloud-based one.\nYou\u2019ll need to take steps along the way to achieve this long-term vision, and\nyou might choose to make one of these steps your next oppor tunity. As an\naside, hopefully someone has done some validation on the overall vision!\nThe challenge with these oppor tunities is assessing whether you can provide\nan immediate value to customers or if it\u2019s delayed gratification. If you believe\nthis opportunity will have an immediate benefit, validate it like any other\noppor tunity. But if it\u2019s something that will take longer for customers to benefit\nfrom, you might only do some internal validation to ensure it makes sense to\nwork on this project right now since it takes resources away from other\nprojects.\nTeam Ideas\nOne of a PM\u2019s biggest challenges is a soft skill, soft power. No one reports to\na PM: you can\u2019t tell people what to do. Instead you need to earn people\u2019s\ntrust, and a great way to do that is to look at building a product as a team sport\nand not departments working in silos. No, it\u2019s not a democracy, and at the end\nof the day you\u2019ll often be the one making calls about a product. But if other\npeople know you listened to and acted upon their input, they\u2019ll feel included\nin the decision-making process and happier with your decisions.\nA great place to include other teams is in this ideation step. There are likely", "other teams that work closely with the customers, such as Design, Customer\nSupport, Business Development, and Sales. Reach out to people on those\nteams and see what thoughts they\u2019ve had based on their experience with\ncustomers and the product. Support teams especially appreciate this, as they\nspend all day working with actual customers, and they have great visibility\ninto what the customers are doing with the product and saying about it. They\noften can provide data like support tickets to back up their ideas.\nBeyond talking directly with other teams, you can organize a group\nbrainstorming session. There are pros and cons to these sessions. A big pro is\nthat many people feel included, and one idea might inspire someone else to\nbuild upon it with a different idea. For example, the sales team might make\none feature request that they think would help the product sell better, and the\nsupport team might mention there are a lot of tickets around that entire feature\nset, so perhaps it should be completely redone.\nA big downside to group brainstorming is that people often fixate on a few\nideas or ways of thinking, missing other oppor tunities. As the group\nfacilitator, you need to help get the creative juices flowing. One way to do t hat\nis to have everyone share the worst ideas they can think of, then figure out\nways to make those ideas even worse. After you\u2019ve done that, flip over and\nfocus on how to make the product better.\nMake sure to keep these sessions at least a little focused by listing your\ncurrent product goals and success metrics. If you want to brainstorm ideas to\nincrease engagement, for example, you\u2019re not going to want to talk about\nputting more ads in the product.\nR&D\nRelated to teamwork, sometimes there are new inventions that a brilliant", "engineer, or team of engineers, creates. What\u2019s nice about these inventions is\nthat there\u2019s usually a prototype of some form so that you can see it in action.\nAdding these inventions to the product\u2014called produc tizing\u2014is often how\nproducts are pushed into the next generation, and they can be a major source\nof customer delight because the customer didn\u2019t expect or ask for them.\nHowever, it can often be a rocky road from prototype to product, and the\ninitial product might have significant tradeoffs or limitations. If you choose to\npursue an oppor tunity like this, make sure to work closely with Engineering to\nunderstand all the challenges you\u2019ll need to solve to make this prototype\nuseful to customers in their daily lives.\nThe Competition\nStravinsky, Faulkner, Picasso\u2026regardless of who said it, you might have\nheard the quote, \u201cGood artists copy. Great artists steal.\u201d Sometimes your\ncompetition has a great idea, and stealing it\u2014and making it better\u2014is your\noppor tunity.\nBe careful with this source. \u201cBecause the other guy did it\u201d is never a valid\nreason alone to create a feature\u2014that\u2019s just copying. First of all, how do you\nknow the competition is smart, and isn\u2019t making a mistake with this feature?\nYou\u2019ll also want to make sure this feature/product fits within your company\u2019s\ncontext. Furthermore, you want to think about where the puck\u2019s going to be,\nrather than where it is right now. If you\u2019re always stealing, you\u2019ll never be\nahead. But the benefit to this source is that you can see how the feature works\nin real life, how customers react to it, and what you\u2019d like to do di fferently.\nHere\u2019s a simple example: For years, many PC manufacturers made stripped-\ndown, slow, small-keyboard, low-cost \u201cnetbook s,\u201d and many analysts kept\ncalling for Apple to make one. Yet Apple prefers high-quality, high-margin", "products, and instead of doing what everyone else was doing and what\nanalysts thought Apple should do, it created the MacBook Air (which was\nincredibly small yet had a full-sized keyboard) and eventually the iPad. Both\nleveraged Apple\u2019s strengths, both were loved by customers, and both had the\nmargins Apple aims to keep. As of writing, netbook s are dead, and many PC\nmanufacturers have created their own MacBook Air and iPad knockoffs.\nBusiness Model and Value Proposition Canvases\nAnother way to create an oppor tunity hypothesis is to explicitly analyze how a\nproduct fits into a business and how the product provides value for the\ncustomer. Alexander Osterwalder and Yves Pigneur created two tools to help\nyou determine those elements, the Business Model Canvas, and the newer\nValue Propos ition Canvas, respectively. They also have two book s, with the\nsame titles as the tools themselves, that do a great job explaining these tools\nin more depth than we cover. Using these tools to look at your product, you\nmight see a missing link that lets you think up an oppor tunity.\nBusiness Model Canvas\nThe Business Model Canvas provides a way to look at all aspects of your\ncompany with a different framing than we showed in Chapter 2. It\u2019s very\nfocused on people, values, and revenue, and filling it out requires you to list\nfacts and hypotheses (e.g., \u201cWe believe these people will be distribution\npartners\u201d). This tool was originally developed for a startup with one product,\nbut it works for a product within a large company, too. Figure 3-5 shows this\ncanvas, and you can find a version to print and fill out at\nhttp://strategyzer.com.", "Figure 3-5. The Business Model Canvas provides a way to look at all aspects of your product.\nHere\u2019s what each block covers:\nKey partners: Who are the people outside the company , from suppliers to\ncontractors, who make the business model work? What key resources do\nwe get from them and what key activities do they perform? Companies\nrarely do everything themselves, and working with partners lets you reduce\nrisk and optimize your activities. There are generally three types of\npartnerships: alliances between non-competitors, strategic partnerships\nbetween competitors, and joint ventures to build something new.\nKey activities: What are the tasks a company  must do well to deliver on\nits value? For example, Apple owns a number of key activities: software\ndevelopment, supply-chain management, store management/distribution, and\nmore. Samsung\u2019s phone unit is focused more on supply-chain management", "and software development.\nKey resources: What are the most important physical, financ ial,\nintellectual (patents, copyrights, etc.), or human resources the company\nneeds to succeed? They can be owned or leased. For many companies\nmaking hardware, human and intellectual resources are key, whereas\nmanufacturing is outsourced to an Asian partner.\nValue propositions: What\u2019s the benefit/value that a certain group of your\nproduc ts or services provides for a given persona? What customer pain\npoints are you solving? The Value Propos ition Canvas will dig into this\nmore, too.\nCustomer relationships: What type of relationship, from personal to\nautomated, do you want to establish with each persona?  For example, a\nhigh-value customer might have a direct email for an account manager\nwhereas the average customer might only have online support forums\navailable. Also consider what each segment expects, what you have now,\nhow costly each relationship is, and how you expect to maintain each\nrelationship.\nChannels: How does the company  reach each persona to deliver the value,\nincluding marketing, communication, distribution, sales, and suppor t?\nHow are you reaching them now? What works best? How are the channels\nintegrated, for example, are sales only via your website?\nCustomer segments: Who are the key personas  the company /produc t will\nserve? These are the most important personas that you believe you\u2019ll create\nthe most value for, and they\u2019re who you want to prioritize oppor tunities for.", "The Value Propos ition Canvas will dive into this more.\nCost structure: Where do your costs come from? This breaks down into\nfixed costs (salaries, rents, utilities) and variable costs (equipment\npurchases). For many companies, human resources are the greatest expense\nbecause people are needed to do key activities so that the businesses can\ndeliver your value to their personas.\nRevenue streams: This represents the company\u2019s incoming cash\u2014revenue\nminus costs is the company\u2019s earnings. A company might have multiple\nrevenue streams, depending on its customer segments, and asking what value\nyou deliver that each customer segment will pay for, what they currently pay,\nand how they\u2019d prefer to pay\u2014e.g., lower recurring fee vs. higher one-time\nfee\u2014helps you determine how to monetize each segment. For example, some\ncompanies offer discounted \u201cHome\u201d editions of their products, which lack\nfeatures that matter at work such as document collaboration that aren\u2019t useful\nin an average household. The \u201cHome\u201d edition is one revenue stream and the\nregular version is another.\nThe Business Model Canvas is great because it lets us write down all of our\nhypotheses, from oppor tunity to distribution, in one place. Using the Business\nModel Canvas alone, it takes some deep thought to find a great oppor tunity\nhypothesis. Fortunately, the Canvas\u2019s authors have developed a newer tool,\nthe Value Propos ition Canvas (Figure 3-6), also available at\nhttp://strategyzer.com, which drills down into the Value Propos itions and\nCustomer Segments blocks to really identify how the product is or isn\u2019t\nproviding value to the customers, and what the customers\u2019 needs are.", "Figure 3-6. The Value Proposition Canvas is focused on the interaction between the customer and the\nproduct, and poorly met or unmet customer needs are a possible product opportunity.\nThe goal of the Value Propos ition Canvas is to help you achieve\nproduct/market fit. This phrase simply means that \u201ca good number of\ncustomers want what you\u2019re selling.\u201d This concept is especially important to\nstartups building their initial product, as startups need to find customers as\nsoon as possible. If they fail to find customers, they either need to pivot the\nbusiness to focus on new customers, possibly even with a new product, or\nthey need to close the business. This also applies to new features in existing\nproducts. After all, you want to build a feature a good number of customers\nwill use.\nThe first part of the Value Propos ition Canvas is diving into the customer\u2014\ncompleting this part of the canvas can help you refine your personas! There\nare three key aspects to the Customer side: jobs, gains, and pains.", "Customer jobs are simply the things the customers are trying to get done, in\ntheir own words, be it a task they\u2019re trying to perform, a problem they\u2019re\ntrying to solve, or a need they want to satisfy. For example, an Apple Watch\nowner is likely interested in easily tracking her fitness\u2014a task\u2014and looking\nstylish\u2014a need. Customers might have multiple jobs, and not all jobs have the\nsame weight. If you ever heard someone say, \u201cFashion over function,\u201d that\nperson\u2019s choosing a social job\u2014l ooking trendy\u2014ove r the actual task.\nCustomer jobs align nicely with product use cases.\nGains are the outcomes the customer wants to achieve, in his own words.\nThey might be expected, and either required or desired, or surprising, ideally\nin a positive way. Gains aren\u2019t just from functional utility: they might provide\nsocial value (This makes me look cool!), illicit positive emotions (I love this\nproduc t!), or save money (This is 1/10th the price!). When talking with\ncustomers about the gains they want, make things as concrete as possible. If\nthe customer says, \u201cIt needs to be fast\u201d find out what \u201cfast\u201d means. 1 second?\n10 seconds? 10 m inutes?\nLast, we have pains. These describe the obstacles preventing the customer\nfrom completing the jobs, along with possible bad outcomes and risks. Just\nlike gains, try to make these concrete. If the customer says waiting for a taxi is\na waste, ask how many minutes it takes until it feels like it\u2019s a waste. Also try\nto gauge how bad each pain actually is. Waiting 10 m inutes for a taxi is a pain,\nbut does it stop you from trying to hail a cab or getting in once it arrives?\nThe second piece of the Value Propos ition Canvas is your product(s), and it\nalso has three aspects: products and services, gain creators, and pain\nrelievers.\nProducts and services are fairly straightforward: What are the produc ts and\nservices available for each persona/customer segment?", "Gain creators refers to how your products and services create benefits and\noutcomes the customer wants, whether those are required, desired, or\nsurprising. Again, these gains might be functional, problem solving, or social\n(including cost savings).\nPain relievers are how your product addresses the customer\u2019s top pains. You\ndon\u2019t have to address every pain, but it should be clear in the Canvas how\nyour product addresses the key pains.\nPain relievers and gain creators are the parts of your product that create\nvalue for the customer segment. The goal of the Value Propos ition Canvas is\nto make these two categories\u2014to make this value creation\u2014explicit. If it\u2019s\nunclear or a piece is missing, you likely have a great oppor tunity to improve\nyour product.\nAt the end of the day, product/market fit or feature/market fit comes down to\naddressing the key customer gains and pains successfully. If the customer\nwants important gains that you don\u2019t provide or has a big pain point you don\u2019t\naddress, those mismatches create a very good oppor tunity for you to improve\nyour product.\nAlso note that some products, especially B2B products, might have multiple\npersonas, so you will need multiple Value Propos ition Canvases, one for each\npersona.\nAs you work to validate your oppor tunity and learn more, redo your\nBusiness Model and Value Propos ition Canvases to incorporate the new\ninformation. You might even want to specifically call out what\u2019s validated and\nwhat\u2019s still a hypothesis.\nExternal Factors\nWhile all of the ways to create an oppor tunity hypothesis so far give us", "educated, good hypotheses, sometimes there are external factors\u2014shall we\nsay\u2014that force an oppor tunity.\nThe simplest and most understandable one is when a good business\noppor tunity arises. For example, maybe a partner offers a large contract if a\ncertain feature is added to the product within a given timeframe. It\u2019s likely\nstill up to the PM to make sure this feature\u2019s worth it\u2014usually by measuring\nthe cost of adding the feature vs. the value of the contract\u2014bu t this type of\narrangement will often take priority over the previous plans.\nNext, sometimes in regulated industries, regulations change and you have to\nprioritize complying with those regulations or your product might be pulled\nfrom sale.\nThe last qualitative method is also the most frustrating. It\u2019s when your boss\nor someone above you says, \u201cJust do this.\u201d A good leader will have a\nreasoning behind the demand or even be willing to change her mind if you\nprovide proof it\u2019s an invalid oppor tunity, but not every leader is rational, and\nnot all rational leads are able to explain their thinking all the time. Sometimes\nyou just have to prioritize what your boss wants, even if it\u2019s not the best\noppor tunity.\nUSING THE KANO MODEL TO FIND OPPORTUNITIES\nIn the 1980s , Professor Noriaki Kano created a framework to help teams\nuncover and classify three categories of customer needs/attributes. Looking at\nwhere your product falls can help you uncover oppor tunities to work on next\nbased on unaddressed or unspoken needs. Furthermore, it helps you assess if\ninvesting in your oppor tunity will provide a worthwhile return, helping you\ntransition into prioritizing your oppor tunities.\nThe Kano model defines three principles that a product needs to achieve to", "be successful over time:\n1. Value attracts customers.\n2. Quality keeps customers and builds loyalty.\n3. Innovation differentiates your product from others and keeps you\ncompetitive.\nThen it maps these principles into feature categories.\nBasic features. These are the things customers expect in a product, usually\nmapping to the value principle, and customers will be very unhappy if they\nare poorly executed or missing. Unfortunately, doing these really well won\u2019t\nmake your users happy\u2014it will just minimize their unhappiness. If you press\nthe gas pedal in your car all the way and the car barely moves, you\u2019ll be\nunhappy. If your car is missing the break pedal, you\u2019ll be very unhappy. If an\napp you have to log in to is missing a password-recovery feature, you\u2019ll be\nvery unhappy when you need it. If you have the fastest, most nicely designed\npassword-recovery feature of any app, your customers will not be\nsignificantly happier than if you had a basic recovery feature. Basic features\ncan be hard to identify when talking with customers, as customers expect\nthem to be there and won\u2019t explicitly mention them. How often do you look\nfor \u201ctoilet paper included\u201d when book ing an Airbnb? Generally you find out\nabout a lack of basic features from complaint systems, lost-customer\nsurveys, and attrition analysis.\nPerformance features (satisfiers). These are the things customers are often\njudging your app by and the things they look for before purchasing. Your\ncustomer\u2019s satisfaction with these features will be proportional to how well", "you execute them. These are fairly easy to find information about by talking\nwith customers, be it through interviews or surveys, because they\u2019re things a\ncustomer will often explicitly ask for, compliment, or complain about. For\nexample, faster performance in an app leads to greater satisfaction. Having\nfewer steps to achieve a goal also increases satisfaction.\nExcitement features (delighters). These are the unexpected \u201cwow\u201d\nfeatures that become product differentiators, innovations, and unique selling\npoints, such as the iPhone\u2019s capacitive touch screen, Android\u2019s notification\npanel, or Wi-Fi on an airplane midflight. When you do these well they create\nsignificant excitement and delight. If they\u2019re missing, customers stay neutral:\nthey don\u2019t know what they\u2019re missing. These features are the hardest to\ndiscover and really require an understanding of customer need. They\u2019re\noften found only qualitatively.\nThese three feature categories are commonly graphed together (Figure 3-7) to\nshow how customer satisfaction compares to your level of\ninvestment/execution. It\u2019s a useful way to help judge how much effort you\nshould spend on various features, along with evaluating what feature\ncategories are worth focusing on next.", "Figure 3-7. The Kano model provides a way to consider how much satisfaction each feature provides\ncompared to what type of feature it is and how well it\u2019s executed.\nOver time, each feature moves \u201cdown\u201d in its category. Excitement features\nbecome performance features, and performance features become basic needs.\nThe first time you had Wi-Fi on a flight, you were likely delighted to check\nyour email while flying. Now you likely expect planes to have Wi-Fi and are\ndisappointed when there\u2019s a poor  signal or no Wi-Fi.", "In general, the first version of your product needs to cover the basic features.\nEach successive generation should focus on a mix of satisfiers and delighters,\nalong with making sure you\u2019re continuing to cover the basic features.\nTo find feature opportunities using the Kano model, map your product and its\nfeatures against the model. What features are about meeting basic\nexpectations? Are they meeting expectations? Have you covered all the\nbasics? If so, move on to a satisfier or a delighter.\nA big frustration for product managers is that basic features can require a\nsignificant investment to even get to a reasonable level. While you want to\nspend your time working on the satisfiers and delighters, skipping the basic\nfeatures or doing them poorly will often lead to less customer satisfaction\neven if you have a great delighter feature.\nIf you\u2019re working on a new version of an existing product, consider what\nfeatures started as excitement features but are now expected and something the\ncompetition has, too. Or similarly, what\u2019s something the competition added\nthat your customers now also expect? How does that affect your feature\nmapping/oppor tunity hypothesis? Touch ID started as a delighter feature on\nthe iPhone, and now fingerprint unlocking is fairly common and expected on\nsmartphones. What new delighters can you find to achieve significant\ncustomer satisfaction?\nMOOVER.IO\u2019S HYPOTHESIS\nBack in Chapter 2, we mentioned that when you book  a move with Moove r,\nthe moving company does a follow-up call to plan details. Based on\ncustomer-satisfaction surveys, it has been found that this is the thing that\ncurrent customers who give the company a lower NPS complain the most\nabout. Being a young business, Moove r has to balance growing the business", "against customer satisfaction.\nThe team did get together and brainstorm ideas, and the other possibility that\nemerged was some type of referral program to help with growth. But given\nhow infrequently moves happen overall, the team\u2019s decided to focus on\nmaking customers happier first. The idea is that happy customers will\nnaturally provide good word-of-mouth referrals, and later on if Moove r\ndoesn\u2019t have good e nough growth they can try various growth techniques.\nAfter looking at the satisfaction-survey results and the product workflow,\nthis is what they came up with:\nCompany goal : Improve customer satisfaction.\nProduct goal : Reduce friction in the current workflow.\nOpportunity hypothesis: We can improve satisfaction for Really\nBusy Rob if we eliminate phone calls with the moving companies and\nconsolidate communication into an in-app m essaging tool.\nSuccess metrics: Since customer satisfaction is our main goal, we\ncan measure it by tracking our NPS.\nOther key metrics: Other key factors that indicate if customers are\nachieving their goals and using this feature are the percentage of\ncustomers who complete the bid-to-completed-move funnel and the\nnumber of messages sent per customer.\nAt this point, as we did with Moover, you should have a hypothesis about the\nunmet customer need you want to address for your personas, an idea about\nwhy you fall short right now, the key metrics you want to improve, and,\npossibly, an idea of what you want to do to try to address this problem. All of\nthese elements should have some supporting evidence, even for blue-sky", "oppor tunities. Read on to learn about how to validate these oppor tunities and\nsee if they\u2019re worth pursuing.\n________ \nCHAPTER THREE TIP\nThis tip is from Beatriz Datange l. Beatriz has worn several hats in the\nstartup world. She\u2019s used her analyst experiences to land produc t\nmanage ment positions where she drives decisions from data and insights.\nHer focus at Produc t School is on how  to use data and c ommunicate metrics\neffectively. You can reach out  to her via Twitter @bzdata.\nWHAT ARE THE KEY DIFFERENCES BETWEEN VANITY\nAND SUCCESS METRICS?\nIf you ask what makes a great product manager, many will say it\u2019s an understanding of what goes where\nand how\u2014not as simple when you\u2019re toggling between Excel spreadsheets, SQL queries, and visualized\ninfographics. We live in a time when data lives everywhere. A product manager should know how to\nextract insight from the right place. Let\u2019s look at how to do so, using Amazon as an example.\nStart by understanding the product\u2019s and the company\u2019s overall value proposition. For Amazon, the\nvalue proposition to customers is the convenience of buying anything and getting it quickly.\nAs a PM, you will need to think from the customer\u2019s perspective. If they chose your product/company\nout of all the competition for the key value proposition, you will need to know how parts of the product\nare performing to make sure the value proposition stays intact. What metrics do customers care about\nthat support the value proposition? These include:\nInventory of every item", "Number of items stocked with inventory compared to top lists/holiday shopping guides\nPercent of items ordered and arriving within an Amazon Prime shipping window (~48 hours)\nAverage load speed of the website\nAverage wait time between submission of a service ticket and resolution\nIf a website were slow or deliveries weren\u2019t on time, customers wouldn\u2019t necessarily think Amazon is\nconvenient. If we fail to deliver on the above metrics, we wouldn\u2019t deliver on our value proposition to\ncustomers, and they\u2019d shop elsewhere. Conversely, when we deliver on these metrics, customers are\nhappy. This means these are success metrics we should focus on.\nWell, what are vanity metrics, then? Eric Ries first spoke of vanity metrics in 2009, defining them as\nmetrics often spoken of at a top-level view. They also are often referred to in acronyms:\nPageviews\nNumber of installs\nDaily/monthly users (DAU)\nGrowth in users, installs, page views\nIt\u2019s great if lots of people look at Amazon each day and go to Amazon first, but if they don\u2019t complete\ntheir transactions on Amazon, then Amazon isn\u2019t winning. In other words, these metrics don\u2019t tell us if\nwe\u2019re making our customers happy or not.\nVanity numbers are great for a quick headline. However, success comes with context. Be sure to look\nfor metrics that matter towards a successful experience for the customer.", "Now that we have an idea, we need to make sure it\u2019s the right thing to do next.\nEvery idea has an oppor tunity cost. Working on Feature A means you\u2019re not\nbuilding Feature B. The hallmark of an effective product manager is being\nable to sort out the great ideas from the merely good on es.\nContinuing our scientific method analogy, now that we have a hypothesis\nabout what to do next, we need to design and run an experiment to prove or\ndisprove our hypothesis. In other words, we want to validate whether our\nidea\u2014no matter how big or small\u2014will really help us achieve our goals.\nThe ideal experiment to validate our hypothesis would be to build the full\nproduct and see how our success metrics change. Sometimes this is the right", "thing to do, such as if your hypothesis is that fixing a bug or adding a small\nfeature will help you achieve your goals. But often, building the full product is\na big investment in both time and cost. This means it\u2019s very risky to always\nbuild the full product to see if it achieves its goals. Instead, companies have\nstarted adopting the lean principles we\u2019ve discussed, finding less expensive\nways to validate an idea before building the product.\nThese validation approaches take many forms. Some ideas need only\ninternal validation by looking at existing data like analytics and having a\ndiscussion with key stakeholders about the cost/benefit of this oppor tunity\nbefore you decide to pursue it or not.\nWith other ideas, especially for new products or major new features, you\u2019ll\nwant to talk with real customers, both current and potential, directly via\ninterviews and indirectly via surveys. This approach, called customer\ndevelopment, will help you understand your customers\u2019 pain points and goals\nmore thoroughly so that you can validate if your idea will address their needs.\nYou might even discover that a different idea many customers complain about\nis worth pursuing instead of your original hypothesis.\nThe last idea-validation method we\u2019ll cover is to run an actual experiment\nand seeing how your metrics change. For a new product or feature, you might\nchoose to build a low-cost minimum viable product (MVP, covered briefly in\nChapter 1). Don\u2019t confuse building an MVP with building the full product\u2014as\nwe\u2019ll cover later, MVPs might even be human-powered. Alternatively, if your\nidea is centered on changing a workflow, you might run an A/B test, which\nlets you compare two versions of something\u2014like two different sign-up\nworkflows\u2014to see which one achieves better success metrics.\nThe right way to validate your oppor tunity hypothesis depends on your\nspecific situation. In general, for each new idea you\u2019ll want to have objective", "data, anecdotal data, and cost/benefit data to be able to fully assess it. This\nmeans you\u2019ll have to do multiple types of validation. You might run an A/B\ntest to gather analytics data, determine the cost by talking with the engineering\nlead, and then have an internal discussion with key stakeholders about the\ncost/benefit. Just showing that the idea will achieve its goals, which an A/B\ntest can do, doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s the right thing to do if the product is very\nexpensive to build.\nLast, once you\u2019ve found and validated an idea, you need to assess where it\nfits on the roadmap. Just because you\u2019ve found a great oppor tunity doesn\u2019t\nmean it\u2019s the best thing for the company to work on next.\nPutting these ideas together with Moove r, how might you validate your idea\nabout how to improve customer satisfaction by building an in-app messaging\ntool? You already have data from an NPS survey, so focus your energy on\ndoing customer development, interviewing real and potential clients to gather\nanecdotal data and ensure you truly understand their needs and pain\npoints/how to make them more satisfied with Moove r. If those interviews\nindicate messaging really is the biggest pain point, then talk with Engineering\nand Design about what it will take to build an MVP of this feature, and if the\nteam agrees this will give the biggest business value for the cost, go build it.\nLet\u2019s dig into each of these validation methods in more detail.\nSWOT ANALYSIS\nA SWOT analysis is a common method for looking at how an oppor tunity\nhypothesis fits in. SWOT stands for strengths, weaknesses, oppor tunities, and\nthreats. This framework helps you identify the most important internal and\nexternal elements of achieving your goals.\nTo do a SWOT analysis, first identify your key goals and success metrics.", "Then create a two-by-two table like Table 4-1. The top row will be your\ninternal elements\u2014the strengths and weaknesses for the product/company\naround achieving your goals. The bottom row will look at external elements\u2014\nthe oppor tunities and threats, including things like cultural, governmental, and\ntechnological trends.\nStrengths: Internally focused view of what you excel atWeaknesses: Internally focused view of where you\nfall short\nOpportunities: Externally-focused view of what you\u2019re\npositioned well to go afterThreats: Externally focused view of factors that\njeopardize your stability\nTable 4-1. SWOT analysis provides a good way to put an opportunity in context at a high level, looking\nat both internal and external elements.\nIf your oppor tunity helps improve a specific strength, take advantage of an\noppor tunity. Or conversely if an oppor tunity limits or converts a weakness or\nthreat, it\u2019s likely worth pursuing even more. If it doesn\u2019t factor in or doesn\u2019t\naddress one of the top-priority items, it\u2019s likely not worth doing now.\nINTERNAL VALIDATION\nAs a PM, you\u2019ll find that there\u2019s no shortage of good ideas for what to do\nnext. In an ideal world, we\u2019d do a comprehensive validation of each idea, but\nthis is rather impractical. Instead, we can do some preliminary internal\nvalidation to see if an idea is worth pursuing.\nHere\u2019s a checklist of questions that will help you start validating an\noppor tunity. If the answer to any of these is negative, then you should most\nlikely not pursue this oppor tunity.", "Is this oppor tunity in line with our  vision?\nDoes it suppor t the produc t\u2019s vision and c ore function?\nCan we do it well with our capabi lities (or is it feasible and\ndesirable to expand our  capabi lities to meet the oppor tunity)?\nHow does it contribute to our  key metrics?\nDo we have any data, be it from analytics, surveys, or bug reports,\nto suppor t this oppor tunity?\nIs it required to meet a critical business initiative?\nHow does it contribute to our  users\u2019 winning?\nIs it on our roadm ap for this year, even indirectly as part of\nsomething else?\nWill it matter in two years? (It\u2019s OK if the feature is to address an\nimmediate need, but you\u2019ll want to limit those, as you want to\nprioritize things that have a higher value over time.)\nWill everyone benefit? If it only helps a niche set of customers, is it\nworth the cost?\nIf it succeeds, can w e suppor t it?\nOur friends at Intercom (introduced in Chapter 3) also suggest looking at your\nreturn on development investment to validate an oppor tunity. Create a two-by-\ntwo grid like Figure 4-1, looking at development effort (high/low) vs. how\nusers value the feature/product (high/low), and figure out where this\noppor tunity falls.", "Figure 4-1. Creating a grid to compare development effort to user value is an easy way to visualize and\ncompare different opportunities. Ideally, you will do low-effort/high-user-value tasks first (Feature A) and\navoid high-effort/low-user-values tasks (Feature C) as much as possible.\nUnfortunately, this isn\u2019t a litmus test for oppor tunities because sometimes we\nhave to do high-effort things that users won\u2019t value, like rebuilding a back\nend, but this grid will help you put things in context. Low-effort, highly valued\nfeatures or products are nearly always worth pursuing.\nFor some oppor tunity hypotheses, like \u201cfixing a bug will help us achieve our\ngoal,\u201d this level of validation might be all you need. If it\u2019s clear from data that\nthe bug significantly affects a lot of users, it prevents users from winning, you\nhave the resources to fix it, and the cost vs. value doesn\u2019t outweigh something\nelse you want to do, then great\u2014you\u2019ve validated that it\u2019s worth fixing the", "bug! Other hypotheses require more effort in order to validate them.\nThis internal validation can also help with a soft skill: Respect. You\u2019ll often\nhave people throughout the company giving you product ideas\u2014in fact, you\u2019ll\nhave more ideas than you can implement. This means you\u2019ll spend most of\nyour time saying \u201cno\u201d to good ideas because you want to focus on the best\nideas. But if you simply say \u201cno\u201d without a reason, people will feel that you\ndon\u2019t listen to them, affecting how well you work together, and they will stop\ncoming to you with ideas, which could prevent you from finding a great one.\nDoing an internal validation will let you easily and explicitly provide a\nreason for why you\u2019re pursuing one idea over another, making people feel like\nyou listened to them and aren\u2019t just making arbitrary product decisions.\nEXTERNAL VALIDATION\nExternal validation simply means getting feedback from real customers to see\nif your idea makes sense. Even though you might think you know what they\u2019ll\nsay, you don\u2019t know for sure until you check.\nThere are many ways to get feedback. The simplest one is to be a data\ndetective. What external data about real customers can you find from existing\nresearch sources to validate your idea? Are there relevant research reports,\nwhether it\u2019s Mary Meeker\u2019s Internet Trends report (available for free), NPD\nGroup\u2019s reports on what people are buying and their behavior (these reports\nare expensive but the data\u2019s very valuable and spans numerous industries),\ncensus data, or even Google Trends to see what people are searching for?\nSometimes it might not be obvious where to look, and you\u2019ll need to see if\nthere\u2019s a similar or analogous vertical whose data will inform your decisions.\nYour primary goal is to focus on the need people are trying to meet, and to\nfind research relevant to that need. This data isn\u2019t always easy to find, and it", "might be spread out across multiple research reports. Financial-analyst\nreports are often great additional sources of overall industry trends.\nAs an example, when on-demand food-delivery services like Postmates\nwere getting started, they could have looked to food-industry reports about\nhow often people order carryout/delivery, how much they spend per order,\nwhat demographics tend to order carryout the most and where they live, which\nsegments of the food industry are growing vs. shrinking, and more.\nSecondarily, Postmates could have researched a specific interaction\nmechanism, push-button ordering with mobile apps, by looking at on-demand\napps like Uber. If Postmates\u2019 hypothesis was that people would like push-\nbutton food delivery, it would\u2019ve meshed these data points, using the food-\nindustry reports to validate demand for food delivery along with the\nmechanism data to validate that people would be willing to order from an\napp.\nMake sure to watch out for confirmation bias. This is when we look for only\nevidence that confirms our hypothesis and ignore evidence that contradicts it.\nAgain, our hypothesis might be wrong, and that\u2019s OK.\nReading market data can be very useful, but it doesn\u2019t always give you great\ninsight to what your customers are feeling, and their needs not captured by\ndata. Empathy can be a powerful validation tool: Is there some way for you to\nbe your customer so that you can accurately understand his needs? Sometimes\nthis is easy; for example, if you\u2019re a PM at Slack, you use Slack internally to\ncommunicate. You\u2019ll know how people use the product because you use it\ndaily, and you can validate your idea by analyzing how useful it\u2019d be to your\nlife and if there\u2019s a tradeoff or cost that\u2019d reduce the value. Be careful here, as\nyou\u2019ll need to make sure the way you use Slack is similar to how your\ncustomers use it.", "Other times, being your customer is doable but takes effort. Ford Motor\nCompany built a special suit, the Third Age Suit, which effectively simulates\nwhat it feels like to be an elderly driver, with reduced joint mobility, a\nsimulated feeling of arthritis, simulated impaired vision conditions, and more.\nThis suit lets Ford employees \u201cbe\u201d an elderly customer to test features in their\ncars without having to bring in a pool of elderly test drivers to observe and\ntalk with.\nThe trick to being your customer is to make sure you\u2019re representative of an\nactual customer. Even though we all like to think we\u2019re an average customer,\nwe\u2019re not\u2014you\u2019re a PM, you\u2019re above  average! And especially if your\nproduct has multiple personas, you\u2019ll likely represent only one of them.\nUnfortunately, sometimes it\u2019s not realistic to be your customer, especially for\nenterprise and niche products. In these cases, you just have to find another\napproach to understanding your customers.\nCustomer Development\nFinally, sometimes it\u2019s necessary to go outside the building to talk with\ncustomers, both current and potential. Keep in mind that the goal right now is\nto figure out whether to build a given thing, not to conduct user\ntesting/research to see if we\u2019ve built a particular thing well. The former\nhappens at the beginning of the product process, and the later will happen\nonce we\u2019ve started building something.\nSo what is customer development? It\u2019s a way to validate if the people you\nthink are your customers truly are the right customers and confirming you\u2019re\non the right path. This includes finding out what problems customers are\nseeking to solve, what they\u2019re doing right now that either creates those\nproblems and tries to solve them, what they\u2019re able to do (technically,", "financially, socially, etc.), and how they find out about and decide if a new\nproduct/feature is worth it. Fundamentally, it\u2019s a conversation and an\nexchange of information.\nIt\u2019s also useful to know what customer development is not. It\u2019s not a way for\npeople to give you a wish list. It\u2019s not a focus group to only see how people\nrespond to ideas. It\u2019s not a place to observe how customers use your\nprototype. It\u2019s also not a replacement for product vision. Customers will give\nyou a huge wish list, but they\u2019ll often ask for more than they actually need, end\nup not using features, and \u2014in really bad cases\u2014might get confused by all the\nextra features. This is a big part of why we recommend having some\noppor tunity hypotheses in mind first.\nInterviews\nWe\u2019ve found that, of the various steps in the product-development life cycle,\npeople new to product management have the least experience with customer\ninterviews. But interviewing is an incredibly valuable skill because it\u2019s an\neffective and low-cost way to validate your oppor tunity hypothesis. And since\na product manager\u2019s ultimate goal is to help the customer be awesome,\nspending time with customers is critical to your role.\nThere are entire book s, such as Cindy Alvarez\u2019s excellent Lean Customer\nDevelopment, that cover in detail how to prepare, do, and learn from\ncustomer interviews. We\u2019ll do our best to give you a detailed overview, but\nwe\u2019d recommend doing further research and practicing your own interviews\nbefore actually talking with customers.\nPreparing for Interviews\nJust like how you don\u2019t walk into a job interview without preparing, or a\nmeeting without anticipating a desired outcome, customer interviews take", "preparation. These steps are largely based on Lean Customer Development\nbecause we believe in them!\nTo get started, write down a list of what you know factually and what you\u2019re\nassuming about our customers, including their needs and how your product\nsatisfies them. The Business Model Canvas can help you identify key\nassumptions. Of course, customers can help you validate only parts of the\ncanvas that apply to them: segments, value propos itions, channels,\nrelationships, and maybe revenue streams. But given how fundamental these\nare to your business/product, they\u2019re quite important to turn from guesses into\nfacts.\nUse the Value Propos ition Canvas to identify what you know for sure and\nwhat you\u2019re assuming are your customers\u2019 existing pains and desired gains.\nAlso try to identify what tradeoffs they\u2019re willing to accept for these gains.\nFor example, does a smartwatch provide enough functional and fashion gain\nthat they\u2019re willing to trade off the sentimental value of their existing watch?\nOr does your augmented-reality headwear provide enough value that your\ncustomers are willing to make the social sacrifice to wear it? Google Glass\nlearned customers\u2019 feelings about that tradeoff in a very public and expensive\nway.\nIt can be helpful to explicitly write your oppor tunity hypothesis in terms of\nthese canvases: \u201cI believe that <personas/segments> experience <this pain>\nwhen doing <task> because of <limitation>, and alleviating that pain would\nlet the customer <achieve this gain>, although she\u2019d have to <accept these\nlimitations>.\u201d\nDon\u2019t forget about what you think your key metrics are and who you believe\nyour competitors are. Your customers might not see the same people as\ncompetitors, or they might know of existing solutions that you don\u2019t.", "Also, it\u2019s useful to know your company and product roadmap: How\u2019d you\nget to where you are, where are you thinking about going, what are the open\nquestions, and what information from customers might help you make better\ndecisions?\nIt\u2019s useful to look at any other persona trait relevant to your oppor tunity\nhypothesis to think about who to talk with, and if there are enough potential\ncustomers to pursue this oppor tunity. For example, if your product provides a\nconvenience service for a fee, you\u2019ll want to focus on customers who will pay\nfor convenience rather than people who have coupons .com as their homepage\n\u2014still talk to a couple of people who value cash over convenience to get a\nsense of where their tipping point might be, however. Other traits to look at\ninclude where potential customers fall on the risk vs. reward, low-tech vs.\ntech-savvy, bored vs. busy, and frequent vs. infrequent purchase spectrum.\nA\u2014hopefully obvious\u2014technique to help make sure you\u2019re finding the right\ncustomers is to create screener questions you ask potential interviewees. Try\nto hide the \u201cright\u201d answer so that people don\u2019t answer with what they think\nyou want to hear. If you want people who use streaming music services, ask\nwhat product they use to listen to music. Also ask questions to exclude\npeople, like, \u201cHow often did you listen to music last week?\u201d Braden Kowitz\nat Google Ventures created a useful template to help you screen for\nparticipants, available at https://goo.gl /uPBXD6.\nOnce you\u2019ve figured out who you want to talk with (more on finding these\npeople shortly), let\u2019s figure out what to ask them. The most important thing to\nknow is that, whether they realize it or not, people are going to try to please\nyou. The most valuable thing you can do is to get the customer to tell you\nabout how they currently deal with whatever problem you\u2019re thinking about\nsolving. Even if you think you have a new service (imagine someone", "considering a food-delivery service like Postmates for the first time), your\ncustomer might already do something in this space (ordering from restaurants\nthat aren\u2019t their favorite specifically because they deliver, getting carry-out,\netc.) that you\u2019ll want to ask about.\nThere\u2019s a phenomenon called \u201cideal self\u201d where if you ask someone about\nwhat they might do, they never give a good answer. Would you like to lose\nweight? Would you like to save time? Would you like to have delivery from\nyour favorite restaurants that don\u2019t currently deliver? Of course the answer is\nyes to all of these!\nInstead, if you ask questions about what people currently do, you\u2019ll see what\nactually happens in their lives, which is a much better predictor of what\nthey\u2019ll do in the future. How often do you go to the gym? What diets have you\nused in the past six months? Do you pay a handyman or fix things around the\nhouse yourself? When did you last order delivery? Did you make a restaurant\nchoice based on who delivered?\nSimilarly, asking what someone will pay is useless because no one will give\nyou an honest and meaningful answer. But it\u2019s useful to ask what they\u2019ve\nalready paid to try to answer this question. If they haven\u2019t spent anything in\nthe area you\u2019re asking about, it\u2019s likely not an issue for them.\nRather than asking customers if they\u2019d like your feature/product\u2014be cause\nthey\u2019ll say yes\u2014it\u2019s better to find out about how they deal with the\nfundamental problem you\u2019re trying to solve. The simplest way to ask a\nquestion like this is, \u201cTell me about how you do < topic> today.\u201d\nUnfortunately, it\u2019ll take some prompting to get useful information. For\nexample, someone might have a situation or limitation that he doesn\u2019t see as\nrelevant to your discussion but that could play a huge role. Maybe your\nproduct needs a fast cellular connection to work well, but the person you\u2019re", "interviewing barely has 3G where he lives. It\u2019s very helpful to get context.\nHere are some sample questions:\nHow often hav e you de alt with this topic?\nWhat were you doi ng right before this topic came up?\nOnce you finished, what\u2019d you do?\nHow long di d it take to deal with the topic?\nWhat made you buy  the produc t relevant to this topic?\nHow often do y ou buy  the produc t?\nWhere do y ou go t o buy  the produc t?\nIt\u2019s also really valuable when you ask questions that get customers to tell you\nstories rather than giving simple yes/no answers. They\u2019ll automatically\nprovide you some background context, or you can politely interrupt and ask\nthem to clarify any needed context. Stories help you go up to a slightly\nabstract level because you\u2019ll often find out why someone was using the\nproduct, what their goals were, and what they prioritized. You\u2019ll also find that\npeople say things implicitly in stories so that you don\u2019t have to prompt for\nmore\u2014e.g. they might mention using Siri, which means they are iPhone users.\nSometimes you\u2019ll have customers who think they know exactly what they\nwant and will tell you specifically. For niche products with advanced users,\nthese people likely do know exactly what they want, and they know enough\nabout how the product works to know what\u2019s possible. But that\u2019s a very small\ngroup. Most customers don\u2019t know what\u2019s possible or impossible, and you\u2019ll\nlikely want to ignore specific feature requests. Instead, it\u2019s your job to figure\nout people\u2019s underlying pains and see if your idea will address them. Think\nabout the Henry Ford\u2019s \u201cfaster horse\u201d example here: The feature request is a", "faster horse. The underlying desire is the desire to get to a destination faster.\nRestating someone\u2019s feature request to make sure you understand it and\nasking what she thinks it\u2019d let her do or  how she envisions using that feature is\nan easy way to start to get to the underlying desire. You could also use the\n\u201cmagic wand\u201d question: If you could wave a magic wand and be able to do\nanything you can\u2019t do today , what would it be? Anything you can imagine is\npossible. What would you like? This might seem like an ideal-self question,\nbut it\u2019s not, because we\u2019re not asking if a customer would do something.\nWe\u2019re actually asking, \u201cWhat\u2019s your biggest pain point around this topic?\u201d in\na more fun way. Hopefully our hypothesis addresses it!\nIt\u2019s also useful to ask about tradeoffs. \u201cIf <new feature/product> were to\nhappen but it meant that <tradeoff>, how would you feel?\u201d This does start to\nhit on the ideal-self question, but it can give you a sense of what a customer\nvalues.\nSometimes customers are used to seeing the world one way, and might not\nrealize that they have a real pain point. Did you realize how annoying the taxi\nexperience was before you tried Uber or Lyft? You might need to think of\nquestions to tease out if there is an unrealized pain point, like asking how\noften someone walks to a hotel to find a taxi rather than trying to hail one on\nthe street.\nIf you have an existing product and a fairly detailed oppor tunity hypothesis,\nyou can also use a hypothetical situation. Have part of the interview where\nyou say something like, \u201cI want to tell you a story about how we imagine\nsomeone like you using the next version of our product based on what we\u2019ve\nheard from other customers. Please interrupt me if you have questions, if you\ndisagree with anything I\u2019m saying, or if I\u2019m just plain wrong!\u201d This approach\ncan help you find out about any limitations customers have, if your product has", "unused features, and if your customers are using your product how you\nimagine they\u2019re using it.\nGenerally, avoid showing any existing products or prototypes, as that\nfocuses the conversation on what you have rather than on what the customer\nneeds. However, it can be useful for customers to show you any existing\nsolutions they have in place, and you might notice aspects of the solutions that\nthe customers don\u2019t explicitly realize.\nYou\u2019ll also want to avoid loaded and leading questions\u2014that is, questions\nthat imply an answer or encourage the customer to answer in a specific way.\n\u201cMr. Smith, do you still beat your wife?\u201d is a loaded question because it\nimplies guilt even if Mr. Smith wouldn\u2019t harm a fly and never ever beat his\nwife. \u201cDo you have problems with your PC?\u201d is leading because it implies\nthe customer uses a PC and that his PC has problems. \u201cTell me about your\nprimary computer\u201d is better because it doesn\u2019t imply any judgment and lets\ncustomers respond with what they care about.\nPut together your first list of questions, but don\u2019t worry about making it\nperfect. As you start to do real interviews, you\u2019ll refine your questions based\non if you\u2019re getting the information you want\u2014this doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019ll get the\nanswers you\u2019re hoping to hear. Your list will never be perfect, but keeping\nthis advice in mind will help you get a great start.\nWe recommend taking a step back once you have a list together, and really\nthinking about if these questions will deliver the information you\u2019re hoping to\nlearn from the interviews. One way to do this would be to imagine what the\nmost useful results would look like\u2014which you could derive by thinking\nabout how you intend to use the results from the interviews\u2014and working\nbackwards to see if your questions will deliver.\nThere is one question you should always ask at the end of an interview: \u201cIs", "there anything else about <this topic> that I should\u2019ve asked about?\u201d Here\u2019s\nwhen you account for the known unknowns\u2014that is, the category of things the\ncustomer cares about, and that you know exists, but you have no idea what\nelse might be in there beyond what you asked. For example, maybe you were\nfocused on how quickly a customer can access Google Now or Siri on his\nphone, but it turns out the customer hates voice recognition because it doesn\u2019t\nwork with his accent.\nOnce you have your question list together, start preparing the logistics. Here\nare some key issues to consider:\nWhat\u2019s the last date where interviews can give you useful\ninformation? Customer development takes time, and often there are\ninternal milestones beyond which new information isn\u2019t helpful.\nKnowing these milestones in advance helps you craft an effective\ninterview schedule.\nWhat level of quality and confidence in the results do you need?\nDo you have a bit of time to really do a thorough job, or do you have\nto work as fast as possible even if the results are imperfect?\nWhat\u2019s the right medium for the interviews: in person or on the\nphone? In person is always best, but that might not be feasible if your\ncustomers aren\u2019t all in the same city. Phone chats are often easier to\nschedule and more convenient, but you\u2019ll miss any non-verbal cues,\nlike facial expressions. Video chat solves that problem, but it can be\nrather frustrating if it\u2019s not working or if the interviewee isn\u2019t tech-\nsavvy\u2014you don\u2019t want to spend your interview time debugging a\nconnection.", "How much time will each interview take? Interviews tend to run\nlong\u2014pe ople run late, you find interesting things to ask about, etc.\u2014\nso if you plan on conducting a 20-minute interview rather than a 30-\nminute one, you\u2019ll likely hit your time goals. Make sure to\ncommunicate your time expectations clearly to your interviewees.\nShould you pay your interviewees? In general, yes. Somewhere\nbetween $50 and $100 per hour is common, and it\u2019s often as a gift\ncard rather than cash. You\u2019re asking people to work for you and\nprovide their expertise, and you\u2019ll use that input to make money. The\none exception would be if you\u2019re talking with someone who reached\nout to you, such as a current customer who emailed the support team.\nThe best way to pay those people is to make the product even better\nfor them! You can also make them feel special by including them in\nearly-access programs.\nFinding People to Talk With\nWe\u2019ve got our hypothesis, we\u2019ve got our interview goals, we\u2019ve got our\nquestions, and we know the type of interviewees we want to talk with. Now\nall we need are interviewees! This might seem scary, but it\u2019s easier than you\nexpect. People like to help others, especially if they can sound like experts.\nApproach people humbly, saying you\u2019d love their help and want input from\ntheir experience, and you\u2019ll find willing interviewees.\nLook at your connections first. Do you know anyone directly who fits your\ntarget persona, or do you know people who might know people? Don\u2019t\nhesitate to ask your connections directly. Make your request explicit: tell them\nwhy you\u2019re asking, make it clear what the interview would involve (time,", "format\u2014like on site vs. phone call), and mention how helpful it would be. If\nyou\u2019re asking a connection to reach into her network, create an easily\nforwarded email so that it\u2019s simple for your friend to press \u201cForward\u201d and\nsend the email to anyone she knows without adding a long note.\nSocial networks can be great resources, too. Reach out on LinkedIn, Quora,\nsubject-relevant forums, or even Twitter to see if you can find people willing\nto help. If there\u2019s a particular physical place your customers hang out, try\ngoing there in person and talking with people, or at least posting a notice\nasking people to contact you if they\u2019d be willing to provide input.\nCraigslist and other online classifieds will be very hit-or-miss, and more\nmiss than hit. You really don\u2019t know who will stumble upon your post given\nCraigslist has such a wide audience, and it might take more time to filter for\nthe right interviewees than it\u2019s worth.\nIf you\u2019re really stumped, ask yourself this: Once you\u2019ve built the product,\nhow are you planning to find customers to sell to? Or, if you already have a\nproduct, how do you reach your existing customers? Use similar techniques to\nreach your audience, but rather than asking them to open their wallets, ask for\ntheir wisdom.\nFor existing products, you should have already had customers reach out to\nyou to offer opinions. People who speak up might not represent the silent\nmajority who won\u2019t complain or comment, though, so you\u2019ll still want to find\nwhat the quieter people want. Your sales and support teams can point you to\ngood customers to talk with. When reaching out to these people, make it clear\nyou\u2019re exploring oppor tunities and not changing the product, and give them\npermission to complain. They\u2019ll let you know about their pain.\nThere are also many market-research firms you can hire to help you find the\nright customers to talk with, and they will also often help conduct interviews.", "These firms can be a bit pricey and take a while to produce results, but they\nmake your life a lot easier.\nNo matter how you find your interview subjects, remember to use your\nscreening questions to make sure these potential subjects fit your criteria.\nAfter you\u2019ve found the right subjects, schedule the interviews. Provide very\nclear instructions for everything your interview subjects need to know, such as\nparking availability for onsite visits and your direct contact information. Once\nscheduled, confirm the interview, and consider a reminder call or email the\nday of, too. Multiple tools that help you schedule interviews, such as\nPowWow, will send the reminders for you.\nConducting the Interviews\nNow comes the fun part\u2014talking with real people. Before you begin, take a\nbreath and smile\u2014you\u2019re a friendly researcher right now, no matter what else\nis going on during the day.\nAs soon as you greet your interviewees, make them feel comfortable. You\nwant them to open up and have a conversation with you, not feel like they\u2019re\nbeing interrogated or rushed. Watch the time, but be courteous about it. Talk\nwith them as a human, and call them by their names\u2014don \u2019t call them\n\u201ccustomer.\u201d Make it clear that there are no right or wrong answers\u2014you want\ntheir expertise and you appreciate their time.\nIt\u2019s helpful to get interviewees talking right away by starting with simple\nquestions that the customers won\u2019t have to think too hard about, like asking\nthem how they deal with the topic you\u2019re looking at now. Imagine an arc: start\nwith small talk, go to easy questions, move to meatier questions, recap key\npoints, and then thank them for their time.\nYour job is to be quiet and listen\u2014don \u2019t jump in and start talking when the", "other person takes a breath. You\u2019ll even want to wait a few beats after\nsomeone finishes a thought before saying more, in case she\u2019s thinking and\nplanning on elaborating on her answer. If someone criticizes your product,\ndon\u2019t get defensive; remain neutral and encouraging, getting the person to talk.\nEven smile and sympathize!\nTo make sure you understand what your interviewees said, ask for anything\nyou want clarified, and even restate what they said into your own words.\nYou\u2019ll also want to clarify vague expressions. If someone says, \u201cI hate\nwaiting for this,\u201d find out where his tipping point is\u2014is he OK waiting one\nminute but five feels like a waste?\nIn terms of taking notes, you\u2019ll generally want to record what your subject\nsays verbatim rather than summarizing. This will help you avoid confirmation\nbias, and it\u2019ll make it easier to analyze the conversation later on. It\u2019s very\nuseful to have a notetaker so that you can focus on the person rather than\nwriting. Failing that, use a smart pen like Livescribe, which records your\nconversation and lets you tap on any notes you take to immediately jump to\nthat part of the conversation.\nMake sure to note any non-verbals, and star any emotional utterances (\u201cI\nhate/love this\u201d). One exception to the verbatim-recording goal is if they say\n\u201cmaybe\u201d; write it dow n as \u201cno.\u201d\nAt the end of an interview, thank the subject for his time, and ask if you can\nfollow up later.\nIf you\u2019ve never done an interview before or you\u2019re not sure about your\nquestions, do a practice interview or three with someone you know. It usually\ntakes 5 to 10 interviews to fully get into the zone, and unless you\u2019re changing\nyour questions, 15 to 20 interviews is usually when you stop hearing new\nthings.", "Drawing Conclusions from Interviews\nTake some time immediately after each interview to pull out 5 to 10 of the\nmost interesting points. Focus on things the subject said that validated or\ninvalidated your hypothesis, carried emotion, or surprised to you.\nEach interview should help you figure out if your hypothesis addresses a\nvalid pain point the customer has: whether the customer has tried to solve that\npain point before, whether the customer cares enough about this pain point to\nwant it fixed, and if there\u2019s nothing that\u2019d stop the customer from using your\nsolution. You should have a good sense of how your product would fit into the\nperson\u2019s life day to day, if it\u2019d replace anything, and, if she wouldn\u2019t buy your\nproduct, the specific reasons why.\nMake sure to pay attention to actionable vs. wishy-washy words your\ncustomers use. If they say, \u201cI keep meaning to,\u201d then they don\u2019t actually care\nabout the topic at hand. If they say, \u201cHere\u2019s what I\u2019ve tried and what I do,\u201d\nthen they care. \u201c<This> would help me achieve <this goal>\u201d is meaningful,\nwhereas, \u201c<This> would be interesting to have\u201d and \u201cI think I could figure out\nhow to use it\u201d mean this person won\u2019t use the product. If they say, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t\nuse it, but others would,\u201d no one will use it. Similarly, \u201cMaybe it\u2019s just me\u201d\nmeans lots of people feel that way.\nPull the data from all your interviews together into an overall summary that\nyou update as you go. Categorize what the customers say as appropriate,\nincluding pain points, emotions, existing solutions, and so on. Even try sorting\ntheir words into \u201cvalidates hypothesis\u201d and \u201cinvalidates hypothesis\u201d buckets.\nTry to see if you can identify trends with multiple customers having similar\ncomments.\nIf you haven\u2019t found anyone excited about your idea in five or so interviews,\neither you\u2019re talking to the wrong people or your problem isn\u2019t a real problem", "for customers. Try changing who your target subjects are, and if the trend\ncontinues, you just invalidated your hypothesis. Also, if your questions aren\u2019t\ngiving you the insights you want, change them!\nIf only a few people see your oppor tunity as a pain point they care about, the\npotential market for your product might not be large enough to matter. You\u2019ll\nwant to do more (like a survey, which we\u2019ll cover next) to try to gauge the\nmarket size, but this should be a warning sign.\nSometimes you\u2019ll notice customers discussing the same pain point again and\nagain, even if it\u2019s different from your oppor tunity. Absolutely note this pain\npoint, and analyze if it\u2019s a better oppor tunity (has a bigger value, lower cost,\netc.) than the one you\u2019re looking at now.\nAfter 15 to 20 interviews, you should have a good idea about how valid\nyour oppor tunity hypothesis is.\nSurveys\n\u201cThe plural of \u2018anecdote\u2019 is not \u2018data.\u2019\u201d (This sentence is attributed to Frank\nKotsonis and Roger Brinner.) Interviews are great because they help you\nfigure out customers\u2019 underlying pain points and motivations, but they\u2019re just a\nsmall sample of your user base (or potential user base). They don\u2019t help you\nquantify issues or measure overall attitudes. Analytics don\u2019t provide that type\nof information either. Analytics are great at exposing what customers actually\ndo, but they don\u2019t tell you anything about what\u2019s going on in a customer\u2019s\nmind.\nSurveys occupy this murky area, where we can get a view inside a lot of\ncustomers\u2019 heads. In general, the data surveys provide isn\u2019t as high quality as\nthat from customer interviews, but it\u2019s a low-cost way to see if our\nconclusions from customer interviews scale to a large number of people.", "There are multiple ways to use surveys\u2014on e example is how we used them\nin Chapter 3 to gauge your overall NPS as a potential starting point for finding\nan oppor tunity. We\u2019ll focus now on using them to validate a hypothesis.\nIn the validation step of the product-development cycle, never start with a\nsurvey\u2014you\u2019ll find out better questions to ask and get more real data about\npeople\u2019s needs with interviews, but once you think the interviews have\nvalidated your hypothesis, surveys will help you see if the bulk of your\ncustomers agree.\nCreating Surveys\nGood survey design is also a bit of an art. Because you\u2019re not there to ask\nclarifying questions or to pay attention to non-verbal cues, you need to be\ncareful of how you design them. You\u2019ll also want to test any survey before\nsending it to a broad group.\nLike you would with an interview, start by explicitly focusing on your goal.\nIt should be \u201cto further validate my hypothesis by seeing how many people\nhave this pain, have invested significant resources trying to solve it, are\nunhappy with the solution, and could implement my solution.\u201d\nIn general, keep surveys short! They should take only a few minutes to fill\nout. Survey fatigue is a real thing, and the quality of the answers in the middle\nof a survey drops compared to the beginning and end, especially on longer\nsurveys. To help account for that fatigue, wherever possible, randomize your\nquestions (or more commonly, randomize the ordering for the groups of\nquestions you present).\nYou\u2019ll also want to randomize how the answers are presented to account for\na bias anyone has toward just picking a specific answer number\u2014remember\nwhen you guessed \u201cC\u201d on every question you didn\u2019t know in school?", "It\u2019s critical to keep your questions and answer choices very clear\u2014you\nmight know what industry jargon means, but your customers might not. Even\nphrases that seem obvious, like \u201cQ4,\u201d can be ambiguous\u2014do you mean a\nfiscal or calendar Q4? Just specify the months instead.\nWhen picking questions, you\u2019ll also want an arc for the survey. Start with\nbroad questions, move into specifics, and close with a place for the customer\nto add any extra thoughts. Group related categories together, too, to help the\ncustomer with context.\nLike with interviews, always aim for actual instead of ideal-self questions\u2014\ni.e., ask what customers have done, not what they might do. Also avoid\nleading and loaded questions. For example, rather than asking if the customer\nhas recently used online billing tools, ask how a customer pays bills, with an\noption for online billing.\nComparison questions, whether between what the customer uses now and\nsomething else or between two hypothetical products, are implicitly leading\nbecause analyzing a hypothetical is very hard. It\u2019s better to present the two\noptions separately and to have people rate their experience with or thoughts\nabout each specific option. Later, you can compare the results.\nComparison questions also often ask two questions in one because you\u2019re\nevaluating each product\u2019s value. It\u2019s always better to ask separate, simple\nquestions rather than one question that really includes multiple questions.\nTables that explicitly ask a user to rank her thoughts about specific items are\nuseful to figure out how many customers value this potential pain point and\nhow much, and to analyze how trends change over time. For example, \u201cAre\nyou completely dissatisfied, slightly dissatisfied, neutral, satisfied,\ncompletely satisfied, or n/a with your ISP\u2019s download speed?\u201d is a useful\nquestion, and you can ask it again and again as the speed and what customers", "do online changes. Ranking like this is also great because it lets you build an\nimportance/satisfaction graph with real data. Simple agree/disagree questions\nare frequently biased because people want to please you and are more likely\nto select \u201cagree.\u201d Use a scale instead to get more accurate answers.\nAsk for specifics when a bucket has a lot of variability. Age is a great\nexample because surveys often have questions asking which age range you fall\ninto. But between 18 and 40, there\u2019s a lot of potential variability in your life,\nespecially depending on where you live. People in cities might still be single,\nliving with roommates, and have lots of disposable income at 30, whereas a\nperson in a rural area might be married with three kids. Instead, ask the\nperson\u2019s age specifically, and ask specifics for any other data you need to\ncorrectly segment the customer. And, of course, remember what we\u2019ve\nmentioned again and again about segmentation around pain/needs/jobs being\nmore effective than around demographics.\nAt the same time, allow for flexibility when needed. Fifty years ago, people\nwere much more likely to join a company, stay there their entire career, and\nthen retire. Today, you could be employed and looking for a job, or self-\nemployed but in between contracts (essentially unemployed).\nIt\u2019s totally reasonable to have empty text fields where people can type\nstories, rather than radio buttons where they\u2019re constrained to fixed answers.\nAsking how someone\u2019s last flight experience on an American carrier was will\nyield more interesting results than, \u201cHow satisfied were you with your\nflight?\u201d Make sure that if you ask for a detailed answer, you don\u2019t set a low\ncharacter limit on your survey\u2019s answer box.\nAsking \u201cwhy\u201d questions can be dangerous because people are not very self-\naware. As with interview questions, aiming to understand a customer\u2019s goals\nhelps dive at motivation more explicitly. \u201cWhat\u2019s the top thing you hope to", "learn from this book ?\u201d is a better question than \u201cWhy did you buy this book ?\u201d\n(Please email the authors if we\u2019re not meeting your needs!)\nWhen conducting a survey about an existing product, it\u2019s also good to ask a\nNet Promoter Score question (see Chapter 2), as this will implicitly help you\nmeasure the score over time as you conduct more surveys.\nExecuting Surveys\nThere are many tools to create surveys: Google Forms, SurveyMonkey,\nTypeform, etc. The best tools will let you add conditional sections so that you\ncan ask follow-up questions based on how your customers answer questions.\nIf they\u2019re unsatisfied with something, you might want to dig into more\nspecifics about why to help you validate your hypothesis, but if they\u2019re\ncompletely satisfied, you don\u2019t need to ask more questions.\nFinding people to take your survey is similar to but arguably easier than an\ninterview because a survey is much less of a demand on someone\u2019s time than\nan interview. If you have an existing app, add a pop-up in-app or email\nexisting customers that meet your filter requirements to ask if they have five\nminutes to take a survey to help improve the product. Note how that sample\ntext has the survey\u2019s goal, \u201chelp improve the product,\u201d which explains why\nit\u2019s valuable for customers to take it. This makes it more likely a customer\nwill complete the survey.\nPosting on various forms and social networks where your target market\nresides is useful, too. If you\u2019re doing minimal manual filtering when sending\nthe survey link, though, you\u2019ll want more filter questions at the start of your\nsurvey to make sure only the people you want to hear from are actually\nprogressing through the survey and answering the main questions.\nThere are also services like Ask Your Target Market that have a large", "mailing list, and you can pay to send your survey link to exactly the right\npeople. Paying for targeted ads on Google, LinkedIn, Twitter, Facebook , and\nmore is another way to find pot ential respondents.\nGenerally surveys are unpaid, but companies often offer a lottery-like\nreward at the end to add an incentive for people to participate (\u201cProvide your\nemail address to be entered in a raffle to win a $100 g ift card\u201d).\nAnalyzing Data\nRun your survey until you feel you have statistically significant results or until\nyou stop getting new/useful/different results.\nWhen you\u2019re ready to start looking at results, the very first thing to do is\nvalidate the data. What do you do with incomplete surveys? Do you want to\nignore them or manually look at them to see where\u2014and maybe why\u2014pe ople\nstoppe d answering? If you use the data, you\u2019ll have a different sample size for\neach question.\nNext, do you want to do any partitioning based on background questions?\nPeople who listen to streaming music daily may have different answers than\npeople who listen once a week. What about cohort analysis? People who\ncame from a professional forum might be different than people who started\nreplying only once you added a raffle.\nYou\u2019ll likely want to do a basic data analysis with any numerical questions\n\u2014i.e., convert scales to numbers, look at the mean, median, variance, etc.\nYou\u2019ll also want to look at the distribution to see if it\u2019s standard/normal\u2014that\nis, most people are around a mean\u2014that says the data trends to a point.\nHowever, if it\u2019s bimodal, answers fall into two discrete categories, that tells\nyou something else, and a mean isn\u2019t useful for that question.\nIn general, like with interviews, you\u2019re still looking for anything that", "validates or invalidates your oppor tunity hypothesis. But the other aspect you\nwant to look for with a survey is how many people feel this is a pain point,\nand how significant of a pain point is it.\nIf everyone agrees it\u2019s a pain point but no one has spent any time or money\ntrying to solve it, your oppor tunity is likely not worth building unless a\nsolution is very cheap to build or you have reason to believe your solution\nwill make customers realize the pain point is bigger than they thought. You\ncould imagine what a survey about voicemail would\u2019ve looked like before\nvisual voicemail on the iPhone\u2014finding, listening to, and saving a specific\nvoicemail message was a pain, but no handset manufacturer spent money to\nsolve it because it required service carrier coope ration.\nIf you used satisfaction questions to build up an importance/satisfaction\ngraph\u2014bot h in terms of how customers perceive importance and how you\ninternally rank importance\u2014you can see if your oppor tunity is the right one to\npursue next or if there\u2019s something more important.\nBecause it\u2019s very easy to fall victim to confirmation bias, try focusing only\non data that invalidates your hypothesis before looking for data that validates\nit. At this point, you should have a very good sense of whether your\nhypothesis is valid and if it\u2019s a valuable enough oppor tunity to pursue.\nExperiments\nAn additional way to validate a hypothesis is to run an experiment where you\nbuild something to test your hypothesis. This isn\u2019t always possible, but if you\ncan run one, it\u2019ll yield incredibly informative results.\nExperiments are complementary to customer development, not a\nreplacement, as they\u2019ll help you see what people do when you make a change,\nbut they won\u2019t help you understand why people do it or what their fundamental", "needs are.\nA/B Tests\nOne of the most common experiments to try with an existing product is called\nan A/B test. The idea\u2019s simple: if you make a change to your existing product\nand address the oppor tunity you\u2019re focused on, what impact does it have on\nyour key metric? You\u2019ll implement the change, randomly give some users the\ncurrent \u201cA\u201d version and some users the new \u201cB\u201d version, and then see if the\nmetric changes in a significant way.\nThe hardest part of an A/B test for people to understand is that you\u2019re not\nfully building out the B version in a well-designed and engineered way. The\ngoal is to hack together something quickly and cheaply that will let you\ndetermine if this oppor tunity is worth pursuing in a more thorough way.\nA/B tests are a great way to validate if your hypothesis achieves your goals\nwith iterative/refinement oppor tunities. For example, Google had a hypothesis\nthat the shade of blue used in advertising links affected click-through rates,\nand A/B (and C/D/E, etc.)-testing different shades let Google find a shade that\ngenerated an extra $200 million in revenue, according to Dan Cobley,\nmanaging director of Google UK.\nIt\u2019s most common to A/B-test navigation, user flows, layout, and\nmessaging/content. If your oppor tunity doesn\u2019t fall into these buckets but you\nthink you can A/B-test it anyway, go for it! In fact, sometimes companies beta-\ntesting a completely redesigned, blue-sky-oppor tunity version of their website\nwill randomly direct part of their traffic to the new site and see how the users\u2019\noverall behavior differs from behavior on the main site.\nOptimizely is a very common tool for implementing A/B tests, and its\nexpanding feature set includes support for web, mobile, and desktop apps,", "custom segmenting/test targeting, analytics, and more.\nSimple MVPs\nWe like to talk about two types of minimum viable products, similar to Lean\nStartup (discussed in Chapter 3). The one people most commonly talk about is\nthe version you\u2019ll actually build and release (covered in Chapter 5). The other\ntype is a very simple MVP that you can create to help validate your hypothesis\n\u2014a scaled-back version of your full product vision. These super-simple\nMVPs will be inexpensive to put together and not actually implemented how\nthe real product will be implemented. But they should provide enough to a\npotential end customer that you can gauge if your oppor tunity\u2019s worth\npursuing.\nThe simplest MVP is a preorder MVP. This helps you evaluate if people are\ninterested enough in your idea to open their wallets for it. Create a fake\nmarketing website for your product, describing it as if it already existed with\nthe features you feel are important, and put a \u201cBuy\u201d button at the bottom of the\nsite. Then, market this product like it actually exists, take out different display\nads, and see how many people click \u201cBuy\u201d.\nTo avoid being completely deceptive, we recommend adding a note when\nsomeone clicks \u201cBuy\u201d that says you haven\u2019t finished building this product, are\ncurrently working on it, and they can enter their email address to be updated\nwhen you have new information. This is also a nice way to capture a list of\ncustomer email addresses you can market to when your product is available.\nFor an existing product, you could create a \u201cNew Feature\u201d section on your\nwebsite, see how many people watch an explainer video showing how you\nintend for the feature to work, and use a \u201cLearn More\u201d button instead of a\n\u201cBuy\u201d button to reveal the truth and again capture email addresses.", "Another type of MVP is a concierge MVP (these names are from Eric Ries\nin The Lean Startup). In it, you\u2019ll manually work with your customer just like\na real concierge would to perform a task, where the task is the overall focus\nfor your oppor tunity hypothesis. If you have a hypothesis that people want a\nrestaurant-recommendation app, you\u2019d act like a concierge to help them select\na restaurant. During this process, you\u2019ll want to explicitly focus on the steps\nyou go through to figure out an answer\u2014which questions matter and which\ndon\u2019t, and what\u2019s involved in completing each step\u2014s o that you can\neventually automate them.\nLooking at this restaurant-app idea, if no one asks for your concierge\u2019s help,\nthat\u2019s a big initial sign that something is wrong. Either you\u2019re not appealing to\nthe right customers or you\u2019re not making your value propos ition clear. Then,\nwhen someone expresses interest, you\u2019ll manually discuss with that person\nwhat type of food he likes and dislikes, what type of restaurant\nambience/price point/etc. he\u2019s looking for, and you\u2019ll run a Yelp search for\nhim. You could even offer to arrange transportation.\nAs you go through this process, you\u2019ll find out if customers are interested in\nthe overall idea, which steps are the most useful and what goes into them,\nwhich steps are unexpected but delightful (like arranging transportation), and\nwhich steps customers don\u2019t care about. This helps you refine your hypothesis\nand create a better cost/value estimation. For example, maybe you find your\ncustomers really want a feature that lets them push a button and simply have a\nLyft show up to take them to a nearby open restaurant that they\u2019ll probably\nlike: they care about instant fulfillment over making a reservation and\nplanning.\nMany service start-ups initially began with a concierge MVP, helping them\ngauge interest and better understand the overall problem space and customer", "needs. Wealthfront, an automated investment service, even started with a\nconcierge MVP by having financial advisors manually working with clients.\nA Wizard of Oz MVP is another simple type, sometimes the next step after\nthe concierge MVP. Here, you\u2019ll create a product that looks like it\u2019s fully built\nto an end customer, but humans are doing the work behind the scenes. The\nZappos  founder didn\u2019t start by making an e-commerce site or stocking tons of\ninventory: he took photos of shoes at different shops (with permission), put\nthem online, and when an order came in, he\u2019d manually buy and ship the\nshoes. But to a customer, it looked like Zappos  had a full inventory and was a\nstore by itself.\nThis style of MVP also doesn\u2019t scale, but it\u2019s another way to validate the\ndemand for your oppor tunity. If you can manually keep up with the demand,\nthis idea probably isn\u2019t worth pursuing. But if people love it and you\u2019re\noverwhelmed, that\u2019s a good h int it\u2019s time to automate it.\nThe last type is a fake door  MVP. If you\u2019re thinking about building a new\nfeature into your product, add the UX elements you\u2019d use to trigger the\ninteraction, but rather than actually delivering the feature, provide a\nnotification that the feature\u2019s coming soon. See how many people use your\n\u201cfake door.\u201d For example, if your hypothesis is that people would find a live\ngroup chat feature useful on your online education site, add a \u201cChat\u201d button\nand see how many people click it. If only a tiny percentage do, reconsider if\nit\u2019s worth pursuing this oppor tunity, depending on the value of those customers\nvs. the cost of implementing the feature.\nThe key to remember with every experiment is that you want to keep it\nsimple and cheap. You don\u2019t want to spend so much time designing the perfect\nA/B test or preorder MVP that you\u2019re burned out before you\u2019ve even run the\nexperiment. You\u2019re going to throw away every experiment, regardless of the", "result. If the result\u2019s positive, you\u2019ll have to build the product or feature for\nreal.\nMOVING FORWARD\nAt this point, even if it took a lot of changes and retries because your initial\nhypothesis was wrong, you should have an oppor tunity hypothesis that you\u2019ve\nvalidated as worth pursuing. Woo! It\u2019s time to get going on your roadmap!\nThere\u2019s one more step to think about, and that\u2019s your oppor tunity\u2019s priority\non the roadmap. Even though you\u2019ve found a great oppor tunity, you have\nlimited resources, and another PM might have found a different priority that\u2019s\nmore important to the company\u2019s goals. Every feature has an oppor tunity cost:\nworking on one thing means you\u2019re not working on something else. As a PM,\nyou want to think strategically to make sure you\u2019re always working on the\nthings that matter most. You might have a great idea that you\u2019ve validated, but\nis it what the company should work on next?\nA helpful litmus test is whether this product or feature will help the company\nachieve its current goals. If not, you should likely table it and work on it when\nthe company is focused on the appropriate goal.\nThe Kano model (Chapter 3) provides a useful way to gauge how critical\nyour product or feature is. Is it a basic feature? If so, it\u2019s probably a high\npriority to do next because your users expect it and you\u2019re not doing it\u2014or at\nleast not well enough. If it\u2019s a satisfier or delighter, you can prioritize it based\non its value (how much you think it will provide towards your goal) vs. cost.\nA simple way to compare priorities is to come up with a value vs. cost\nnumber. Work with an engineering lead to put difficulty values on different\noppor tunities. From your customer-development work and other internal\nanalysis, create business-value numbers for each oppor tunity. Use higher", "numbers to indicate more expensive cost, or more valuable. Because it\u2019s\ntough to estimate value and difficulty precisely, use an exponential series\nrather than a linear one\u2014i.e., use 1, 2, 4, 8, and 16 rather than 1 through 5.\nThis way, it\u2019s very clear when one oppor tunity is harder or more valuable\nthan another. Next, for each oppor tunity, figure out a score using score =\nvalue\u00f7cost. Focus on the highest-scoring oppor tunities first, as they provide\nthe most value for the lowest cost. You might choose to change priorities\nbased on other factors, but this will give you a good s tarting point.\nWe\u2019ll conclude this section with a warning: you might have a run of good\nluck where you create hypotheses that customers vehemently validate. Keep\nvalidating your ideas, though; just because you were right before doesn\u2019t mean\nyou\u2019ll always be right. Taking time to validate your idea is a lot more\neffective than skipping this step, building the product/feature, and finding out\nyou were wrong.\nMOOVER\u2019S OPPORTUNITY-VALIDATION STRATEGY\nIn Chapter 3 we came up with a hypothesis for Moove r that if we integrate\ninto the app everything that happened in the follow-up call for planning a\nmove, our customers will be happier. We came up with this from data\u2014NPS\nsurvey results\u2014plus internal discussion. During the internal discussion, we\nessentially did the internal validation, and we agreed it made sense to work\non.\nBut Moove r has a lot of possible things to work on next, and we want to\nmake sure in-app messaging is the right one. This means we want to do\ncustomer development, interviewing real customers. We want to learn if\nmessaging really is an annoyance, if our in-app messaging feature would\nsolve that pain, and if there\u2019s something else we\u2019ve missed that we should", "work on instead.\nHere\u2019s the first version of our interview template:\nHave you moved before, without Moove r? If so, what was it like?\nHow did you hear about Moove r?\nWhat was your experience like using Moove r?\nWhich moving company did you pick, and what made you pick them?\nHow did you communicate with the moving company outside of\nMoove r?\n(If they say \u201cphone\u201d): How many times did you attempt to contact each\nother before you actually talked? (That is, you call them and get\nvoicemail and you miss their return call.)\nHow do y ou feel about talking with someone on the phone?\nCould you tell me what your first and second preferred forms of\ncommunication are (e.g., phone calls, email, SMS, something else)?\nWhat additional information did the moving company need to give you\na final estimate?\nHow long did it take to go from starting to communicate with the\ncompany to providing your information to getting a final bid? Did that\ndelay affect your planning?\nDid you have any special items, like a piano? If so, what was it like to", "arrange moving that?\n(If the move has happened already): How did things go the day of the\nmove? Was there any preparation with the movers that didn\u2019t happen\nthat would\u2019ve made the actual move smoother? Post-move, how did\nthings go with the moving company?\n(If they\u2019ve moved previously): What parts of Moove r saved you time\ncompared to when you moved before?\nIf I could wave a magic wand and change any part of the moving\nexperience (aside from packing and unpacking\u2014say this with a\nlaugh), what would you want me to change?\nOn a scale of 1 to 10, with 10 being \u201cdefinitely\u201d and 1 being \u201cnot at\nall,\u201d how likely are you to recommend Moove r to a friend? (If you\ndon\u2019t think you\u2019ve gotten answers that reflect this number, probe more\nand ask about the single biggest factor that led to their picking that\nnumber.)\nIs there anything I didn\u2019t ask you about communicating with the\nmoving company that I should know?\nWe\u2019ll refine this as we do interviews, but this is a good starting point that will\ngive us a sense of what customers think about the whole experience, if there\u2019s\nanother pain point that comes up commonly, and if communicating with\nmoving companies to figure out details really was a pain point.\nWe\u2019ll also want to reach out to customers who leaked from the funnel at the\nphone-call step to see what was painful about that step. Those interview", "questions will be similar, but we\u2019ll ask questions about what they did to book\nthe move instead of using Moover and what about the phone-call step\nspecifically caused them to choose that alternative.\nAfter doing these customer interviews, if in-app messaging still looks like\nthe biggest pain point, we\u2019ll look at the development effort needed to build it.\nIf it\u2019s fairly low, we\u2019ll just build it. If it\u2019s high, we\u2019ll implement a Wizard of\nOz MVP next. The customer will send a message, we\u2019ll contact the moving\ncompany on the customer\u2019s behalf, and we\u2019ll reply to the customer on the\ncompany\u2019s behalf. We\u2019ll run this experiment for a while and see how the NPS\nnumbers change and if any customer explicitly comments on the in-app\nmessaging. Then we\u2019ll use that data to decide if we should build this feature\nfor real.\n________ \nCHAPTER FOUR TIP\nThis chapter\u2019s tip comes to us from Nik Laufer-Edel.

To do that\nwe know we first have to understand our users. We know we should validate our riskiest assumptions.\nWe know we should gain confidence that our problem makes sense to work on and that our solutions\nactually solve the problem. But there\u2019s more we need to know to make good product decisions.\nOver the years, I\u2019ve designed a simple customer-journey model to remind myself of the context needed\nto define problems and evaluate solutions. The base of the model came about during two years I spent\ndoing customer-development research at an early-stage start-up. It\u2019s evolved since to incorporate some\nof the research around motivation theory as well as concepts discussed in the realm of the Jobs to Be\nDone framework.\nAssuming you\u2019re not trying to create an entirely new behavior, the model acts as a reminder that your\nusers already have a perspective on the problem you\u2019re solving, a way in which they measure success,\nand a means by which they work towards that desired state. These are the basic building blocks of\nunderstanding users and today this information is often captured in personas, metrics, and user flows.\nWhat can be missing from these artifacts is what motivates users to make progress towards a desired\nstate and what holds them back.\nYou can use this model of the customer journey as your North Star when articulating or reflecting on\nany product initiative.\nCURRENT STATE", "What\u2019s the users\u2019 current perspective of the problem? How do they think and feel about it?\nJourney\nWhat are the current steps they take? This is often the flow of your application but might also\ninclude taking steps outside of your app or using competitors.\nMOTIVATION\nWhat about the current solution are they not happy with?\nWhat about the new solution is uniquely appealing?\nDo they believe that following the journey will get them to the desired state?\nDo they believe they have the ability to do what will be asked of them at each step?\nDo they believe they will be supported if they run into problems?\nHINDERANCES\nWhat about the current solution do they like?\nWhat about switching to the new solution worries them?\nDesired State\nHow do they measure success? What is winning?\nHow does getting to this state move them closer to other, larger goals?\nI start all initiatives by drawing out the model to align the team and develop research questions. For\nmature products and iterations on existing features you may already be able to speak to all parts of the\nmodel. For new products or features you\u2019ll discover gaps in the team\u2019s knowledge or risky assumptions\nto tackle through internal or external validation. Ultimately, understanding what winning is for your\ncustomer, their current situation, and the factors that will help them or hinder them from making progress\nwill equip you and your team to make better product decisions. Good luck!", "Finding and validating the right oppor tunity to work on next has gotten you to\nthe starting line of the product-development life cycle. Now we need to run\nthe race and actually build the product. In this chapter we\u2019ll look at how to\ntransition from an oppor tunity to something actionable, and in Chapters 6\nthrough 8 we\u2019ll dive into the entire \u201cget it built and launched\u201d process.\nFundamentally, this chapter is about an important PM soft skill\u2014\ncommunication\u2014and how to effectively communicate, discuss, and finalize\nthe oppor tunity you\u2019ve found with key stakeholders.\nWHY NEW IDEAS STRUGGLE", "A product manager\u2019s job includes anticipating what might cause the product\nto flop and addressing that risk up front. The biggest reason new products\nstruggle isn\u2019t a technical reason\u2014it\u2019s because customers don\u2019t want or need\nthe product you end up building. In other words, it happens because you don\u2019t\nachieve product/market fit. Fortunately, there are things you can do to give\nyour product the best possible chance of success.\nTaking steps to validate your idea, like we went over in Chapter 4, will\nhelp get your product started the right way, as you\u2019ll have made sure there\nwill be some need for your product or feature\u2014from this point we\u2019ll say\n\u201cproduct\u201d for simplicity. But numerous issues that might crop up and prevent\nyour finished product from achieving product/market fit, as you go from\n\u201cidea that we believe customers want\u201d to released product. It\u2019s your job to\nanticipate and prevent these issues before they cause harm to your product.\nHere\u2019s an example. What if there\u2019s a hidden barrier you never learned about\nor addressed that prevents customers from using your product? Remember\nthe Kano model from Chapter 3? There are often basic expectations that a\ncustomer won\u2019t explicitly mention, but if your product is missing those\nfeatures, the customer will be unhappy and might not even use it. Imagine if\nyou booked a hotel room and there was no bed. Or toilet paper. Or sink.\nWould you stay or would you immediately go to another hotel? Early test\nphases with key customers as you build your product can help make sure you\ndon\u2019t miss a hidden barrier.\nBut hidden barriers are just one thing that might prevent you from achieving\nproduct/market fit. Other obstacles include the following:\nIt takes you so long to build and release your product that your\ncustomers\u2019 needs have changed or they found a better solution.", "Your product has so many features, new customers can\u2019t figure out\nhow to use it, quickly getting frustrated and abandoning it. Or if\nyou\u2019re adding a new feature to an existing product, perhaps it ends up\nbeing hidden where no one finds it.\nThe product\u2019s value wasn\u2019t even clear in the first place, and\ncustomers didn\u2019t purchase it because they didn\u2019t realize it would\naddress their needs.\nTo be fair, you won\u2019t be able to anticipate every possible obstacle, nor does\nanyone expect you to\u2014that\u2019s what iteration is about. However, as you start to\nbuild your product, there are steps you can take that will give your product\nthe best chance of success possible. These steps start with writing a few key\ndocuments that will help you clearly establish your goals and desired\noutcomes, create empathy for your customers, and allow for clear\ncommunication with stakeholders. Those traits combine to help you and your\nteam make smart decisions as you build your product, giving it the best\nchance of success.\nWORKING BACKWARDS BY IMAGINING THE FUTURE\nBuilding something new involves imagining the future and making it happen.\nWe frequently find it useful to start development on a new product by\ndescribing what the world will be like when the product\u2019s done. Imagine\nyou\u2019re writing a science fiction story about a near-future world with your\nproduct.\nThere are two great \u201cimagine the future\u201d documents to try writing before\nanyone\u2019s written a line of code. These documents are a press release and a\nproduct review. Amazon often has its product managers write a press release", "when starting development. But press releases are internally focused, and\nthey cover how you imagine talking about the product when it\u2019s done. Writing\nthe product review you want to receive before starting development forces\nyou to think about how you want the product to be perceived externally when\nit\u2019s done.\nBoth of these documents are useful to write, as they help answer key\nquestions up front and help communicate with key stakeholders. When you\nstart to build a new product, writing these documents forces you to take your\nproduct ideas out of your head and get them down on paper, making it much\neasier to share your ideas with other stakeholders. Furthermore, writing\ndown your ideas will help ensure you have initial answers for important\nproduct questions like, \u201cWhat are the key features customers will care about\nthat we\u2019ll want to promote?\u201d\nOver time, as you build out the product, come back to the review and the\npress release, and update them whenever you\u2019re at a critical decision point.\nHow do these documents change if you choose not to build a specific feature,\nfor example? If you\u2019re unhappy with how your review is changing, what can\nyou do to get it back on a good t rack?\nWriting an Internal Future Press Release\nWhile not the most fun prose-wise to write, writing a press release before\nyou start product development forces you to explicitly write dow n your target\nmarket, the problem you\u2019re addressing, how you\u2019re solving it, and the key\nfeatures of the solution\u2014succinctly, in less than a page.\nSharing the press release with stakeholders, including the engineering and\ndesign leads, will also help you start to uncover any internal barriers and\nfigure out what questions you need to answer before the team can start fully", "building this product. Perhaps this product relies on building a new piece of\ntechnology, and you need the engineering team\u2019s help to build a prototype to\nsee if it\u2019s even technically feasible. You\u2019ll need to find time on their\nschedule, and that prototype will be a milestone towards the overall project,\naffecting the release date even before you\u2019ve started planning the project.\nWriting a press release will also help you start to determine how you\ncommunicate the product\u2019s value to customers, along with how customers\nwill find and get started using the product. You\u2019ll likely change both of those\nas you actually build the product, but thinking about them up front helps\naddress two major reasons products flop.\nFurthermore, it\u2019s one final validation step to make sure this is really what\nyou want to do next. If you\u2019re not excited to write this press release, and no\none is excited to read it, are you working on the right oppor tunity? Is there\nsomething else you would be excited to write, and excited for customers to\nread?\nSimilarly, ask yourself if the product described in the press release really\nwill help you hit your goals. You could try writing a press release as if you\nachieved your goal. For example, if your goal is to grow your engaged\ncustomer base to a certain target number, write a press release about how\nyou\u2019ve hit that milestone and the role this product played in hitting it. If the\npress release feels contrived or very hard to write, then perhaps this product\nisn\u2019t the right thing to build to help you achieve your goals.\nA basic product press release usually includes these elements:\nHeadline: If you were to tell your friend about this product in a sentence,\nwhat would you say? Included in that is the key target market, how it helps\nthem win, and a tentative product name that the target market can", "understand. Sometimes you will need two sentences, in which case you\nshould write a headline and a subheading.\nSummary paragraph: The first full paragraph in your press release should\ncall out the most important aspects of the product and how it solves the\ncustomer\u2019s problem. Imagine you\u2019re reading this press release on Flipboa rd\nor Apple News\u2014most people will read only this first paragraph, so it\nneeds to be concise but complete.\nProblem and solution: The next section should elaborate on the problem\nand your solution in more detail.\nSpokesperson quote: Include a quote from you, the product manager, about\nhow this product is great for your customers. It\u2019s fine to include this in the\nsolution text.\nCustomer quote: Include a quote from a fictional customer about how the\nproduct fits into his life.\nConclusion/how to get started: Explain how new customers can find/sign\nup/buy/use this product, and pull everything together with a call to action.\nIf you find you need to write more to help make your thoughts about the\nproduct clear, especially around issues that relate internally to your company\nand how you\u2019ll get the product built rather than around issues related to the\ncustomer, then also write a product FAQ document.\nWriting a Review\nThe other \u201cimagine the future\u201d document you might write at the start of the\nproject, especially for a major new version of a product or a brand-new", "product, is the review you want your product to receive. Imagine if Recode,\nor whomever is appropriate, were reviewing the released version of your\nproduct\u2014what would they say?\nIn a press release you think about how you want to talk about your product,\nbut a review forces you to think about what customers will hear and how\nthey\u2019ll experience the product. Therefore, this is where you need to be honest\nabout what tradeoffs you\u2019re willing to make with the product. Maybe your\nproduct will be amazing but also pricier than the competitors. The reviewers\nwill call this out\u2014Are you OK with that? If not, and you start taking steps to\nreduce its price, what tradeoffs will occur? Will you need more customers to\nmake up for lost revenue? Is that achievable? Will you need to reduce the\nfeature set? What impact would that have on the review?\nSimilarly, what parts of your product do you think a reviewer will focus on,\nand which will they ignore? The parts you discuss the most are the parts\nwhere you\u2019ll later spend most of your design and engineering effort.\nMostly importantly, the review should have a conclusion about why a\ncustomer should buy your product, especially over a competitor\u2019s or\nwhatever the customer is doing now. This conclusion should reflect the\nunique, differentiating value your product offers. If it\u2019s something minor, such\nas identical features at a slightly lower cost, then your product might struggle\nto stand out\u2014if a competitor has a sale, there\u2019s suddenly no difference in\nyour products, and you\u2019ll be seen as a copycat.\nWriting that conclusion will force you to connect the concepts in the\nprevious three chapters: What are your company\u2019s core competencies? How\ndo those connect to this oppor tunity? For example, especially at first, Google\nDocs was much more limited than Microsoft Word. But it was cloud-based,\ncollaborative, and platform-agnostic\u2014in addition to being free. Those three", "factors are how Google used its strengths to build a differentiated word\nprocessor. If it had been a free app you downloaded and installed on your\nMac or PC, a review would\u2019ve concluded that it was a very limited free\nword processor, and that\u2019s it\u2014that product wouldn\u2019t have taken advantage of\nGoogle\u2019s strengths.\nJust like your press release, your review should be concise. Most product\nreviews don\u2019t exhaustively look at every feature. They give customers\nenough information to help them know what problem the product solves, if it\nsolves the problem well, what tradeoffs the product has, and if they should\nbuy the product.\nDefining a Minimum Viable Product\nClearly defining the MVP you want to ship and working backwards to\ndetermine how to achieve it is another way to help set your product up for\nsuccess. In Chapter 4 we talked about using one type of MVP\u2014simple ones\nhacked together and not built like the actual product\u2014to validate your\noppor tunity hypothesis. Now let\u2019s look at MVPs from a \u201cwhat will we\nactually build?\u201d perspective.\nAs you wrote your press release and product review, you were forced to\npick out the most important parts of your product to talk about. The single\nmost important aspect of your product, the one that delivers the real value for\nyour customers, is the starting point to define the MVP. You\u2019ll prioritize\nbuilding that part first, and at some companies that will also be the initial\nproduct you release.\nBefore we go further, let\u2019s clear up a big misconception about MVPs.\nMinimum doesn\u2019t mean bad. Your product is still going to be designed and\nengineered well, tested thoroughly, and, most importantly, it will deliver", "value to the user. It should be a product that people are willing to buy and\nuse. Even if it\u2019s not fully featured, it should work well enough that it becomes\nyour customers\u2019 go-to solution.\nImagine a product that has only one button. It\u2019s easy for customers to use\nthis product, because their only option is to press a button. Now imagine you\nadd a second button. Suddenly the product is a lot harder to use because\ncustomers have to choose which button to push. Every button or feature you\nadd increases the friction for customers\u2014it makes them have to think more\nabout what they\u2019re doing.\nMinimum simply means the fewest buttons or features you need to build to\ndeliver the most important value. This prevents you from building features\nthat no one ends up using, or, worse, making the product so complex a\ncustomer doesn\u2019t use it at all. In an ideal world with lean methodology,\nyou\u2019ll release your MVP to real customers and then determine what to do\nnext based on what they\u2019re actually doing with the product and what\nlimitations they encounter. In other words, you\u2019re always just building MVPs\nand iterating.\nUnfortunately, we often end up in non-ideal situations where we iterate less\nfrequently, like building a major new version of our product, and we\u2019ll be\nexpected to ship more than just the pure MVP. In these cases, defining the\nMVP will help you prioritize the pieces you absolutely have to build to\ndeliver on the product. For the beyond-MVP features, rather than arbitrarily\npicking features to build, test your MVP with key customers before release.\nThen, use their feedback to figure out what extra features to prioritize. Even\nthough the end release will be more than an MVP, this approach helps you\nuse an MVP internally, effectively.\nSo how do you come up with your MVP? Using your press release and", "product reviews as a guide, let\u2019s make a list about your product.\n1. Write down the overall thing you\u2019re doing and why you\u2019re doing it.\nThat is, what value will it deliver for your customers and what goal\nwill it help you achieve? Explicitly put this statement at the top.\n2. List the features you think you need to achieve that top-level goal,\nalong with why that feature\u2019s important. Rather than just writing\n\u201ccloud data store,\u201d write \u201ccloud data store so that customers can\naccess their data from any device.\u201d\nNow here\u2019s the kicker: as you work on this step, you\u2019re not allowed\nto add any new feature category not listed in the press release and\nproduct review. You\u2019ll define each feature in more detail (e.g., you\nmight need a way to log in, so that people can access your service,\nand a way to reset passwords), but you can\u2019t add something major.\nFor example, if you wrote a fictional press release about the iPhone\n5S and never mentioned Touch ID, you can\u2019t suddenly list Touch ID\nas part of the MVP. Whether you realized it or not, writing the press\nrelease and review helped you prioritize the most important parts of\nyour product, which in turn helps define the MVP.\n3. Go through your feature list and cross out whatever items customers\ndon\u2019t actually require to address their core need. This step is the\nreally hard part\u2014MVPs should be uncomfortable. You as the product\nmanager should feel like the MVP is not feature-rich enough, but\nthere should be enough functionality that customers can accomplish\ntheir goals. For example, even though two-factor authentication is\nmore secure, is it really critical to your customer or can it have a", "lower priority?\nEliminating features might even eliminate certain personas from\nusing your product. That\u2019s OK, as long as it doesn\u2019t prevent your key\ntarget market from using the product. If your product is very risky,\nsuch as relying on technology engineering hasn\u2019t built yet, you might\neven define a \u201csingle use case MVP,\u201d which can be used by only one\npersona for one situation\u2014a risky one. If the MVP works for the key\nmarket, then over time you can build the needed features to support\nmore personas.\nBy the time you\u2019re done, you should have what you believe is a clearly\ndefined MVP, along with explanations about why each feature is part of the\nMVP.\nMVPs, Plussing, and the Kano Model\nWe love MVPs because they let you focus on delivering a product your\ncustomers want and will use. But remember, minimum doesn\u2019t mean bad. You\nneed to be continuously seeking ways to make sure what you\u2019re doing is\ngreat. In Chapter 3 we talked about the Kano model, and we introduced the\nidea of delighter features, features that customers don\u2019t ask for but that\ndeliver a huge return in customer satisfaction.\nAs you\u2019re defining your MVP, it\u2019s easy to inadvertently dismiss delighter\nfeatures as non-essential work, after all, customers aren\u2019t explicitly asking\nfor them. But it\u2019s your job as a PM to advoc ate and to keep these features\npart of the MVP when possible, as they\u2019re critical to building innovative,\ndifferentiated products that your customers love.\nTo help you think about these features, we want to share an idea from Walt", "Disney. He came up with the idea of \u201cplussing,\u201d which is simply finding\nways to make a good idea great and to deliver beyond what people expect.\nSound familiar?\nDisney historian Les Perkins tells a story from the early days of Disneyland.\nWalt was holding a Christmas parade, which cost $350,000. His accountants\nbegged him not to spend that money, because people would already be in the\npark. Walt\u2019s reply was, \u201cThat\u2019s just the point. We should do the parade\nprecisely because no one\u2019s expecting it. Our goal at Disneyland is to always\ngive the people more than they expect. As long as we keep surprising them,\nthey\u2019ll keep coming back. But if they ever stop coming, it\u2019ll cost us ten times\nthat much to get them to come back.\u201d\nTo this day, The Walt Disney Company\u2019s culture has integrated plussing in\neverything they do. At a park, a cast member might go out of his way to\nunexpectedly help your family skip a long line, and this unexpected delight\nmakes your day even more awesome. The sunken ship and sharks explosion\nsequence in Finding N emo was a lot of fun, and the final shot with two birds\nsitting on the water completely plusses it (we\u2019re not going to spoil the\nsurprise in case you haven\u2019t seen it). The results of continuously delivering\nmore than people expect, in both revenue and customer satisfaction, speak for\nthemselves\nWhen you\u2019re defining your MVP, an extra filter as you\u2019re cutting potential\nfeatures is to ask, \u201cDoes this plus the core idea?\u201d If it really does, spend\nsome extra time considering if you should cut it or not. Conversely, if you\u2019re\nstruggling to find ways to define delighter ideas, ask yourself, \u201cHow could I\nplus this?\u201d\nWhile plussing is arguably not fully in line with lean thinking, you\u2019ll likely\ndiscover that plussing your initial MVP is key to building products that", "customer\u2019s don\u2019t just use, but also love.\nNext, let\u2019s look at how to effectively discuss the MVP and the project as a\nwhole with other stakeholders.\nCOMMUNICATING VIA A PRODUCT REQUIREMENTS\nDOCUMENT\nOne of the most importantly tools to help you communicate is a well-written\nproduc t requirements document (PRD). A PRD is an explanation of the\nspecific product you\u2019re building. It clearly explains why you\u2019re building this\nproduct, both for your internal goals and for your customers, along with the\nexact scope\u2014the features and functionality\u2014of the product. Similarly, it\nshould convey what you\u2019re not building.\nFor better or worse, PRDs have become a controversial topic in the\nproduct-management world. In very waterfall-oriented companies, a PM will\nspend a long time writing a very detailed PRD. These huge documents, often\n20 pages or more, specify every aspect of a product up front, they are\ndifficult to read, and they are essentially immutable once finished\u2014this is\nwhat the team is going to implement no matter what. Advoc ates of lean\nmethodology use the PRD as an example of everything wrong with waterfall\ndevelopment. Specifically, they believe in quick iteration and using new\nknowledge to plan what to do next, and long and detailed specifications for\nwhat you\u2019ll do a re contrary to that approach.\nWe believe that a PRD, if done well, is a fantastic communication tool, and\nwe\u2019re going to help you create effective ones that others will read.\nFurthermore, we view a PRD as a living document. You\u2019ll update it as the\nproject progresses, documenting changes in scope along with key decisions\nand fleshing it out with relevant information like user design tests. Unlike", "when product management first emerged and people created detailed PRDs\nbefore a project began, we believe that the PRD is finished only when the\nproduct\u2019s released.\nThe PRD is a tool for everyone involved in the product. At first you\u2019ll use\nit to get all the key stakeholders on the same page and help the team\nunderstand the project. Having an initial PRD can be reassuring and inspire\nconfidence in your project, as it\u2019s clear to others in the company that you\nhave an idea for where to take the project. We believe that, throughout the\nproject, the PRD should be the project\u2019s home page\u2014or at least the very first\nlink on the project\u2019s homepage. As you near release, your support and sales\nteams will use it to find out everything they need to know about the product.\nAnd when you\u2019re done, it\u2019s a historical reference for why you made certain\ndecisions.\nWe should mention that you won\u2019t need a PRD\u2014or an imaginary press\nrelease/product review\u2014for every oppor tunity you pursue. A bug fix, for\nexample, won\u2019t need a PRD. There\u2019s no exact division as to when you do\nand don\u2019t need to write a PRD. Our recommendation is to write one for any\noppor tunity that is more of a project, involving communication between\nvarious teams and pot ential confusion rather than a clear, small change.\nLet\u2019s look at what goes into a PRD and how to use it as a communications\ntool.\nBreaking Down a PRD\nThese are the key sections in a PRD:\nTitle: Give this project a distinct name.\nChange history: Provide a description of each important change to the", "PRD, including who changed it, when, and in what specific way.\nOverview: Briefly, what is this project about? Why are you doing it?\nObjectives: What will this let the customer do? What are our high-level\ninternal goals for doing this project?\nSuccess metrics: What are the success metrics that indicate you\u2019re\nachieving your internal goals for the project?\nMessaging: What\u2019s the product messaging marketing will use to describe\nthis product to customers, both new and existing?\nTimeline/release planning: What\u2019s the overall schedule you\u2019re working\ntowards?\nPersonas: Who are the target personas for this product, and which is the\nkey persona?\nUser scenarios: These are full stories about how various personas will use\nthe product in context.\nRequirements/features in: These are the distinct, prioritized features\nalong with a short explanation as to why the features are important.\nFeatures out: What have you explicitly decided not to do a nd why?\nDesigns: Include any needed early sketches, and link to the actual designs\nonce they\u2019re available.\nOpen issues: What factors do y ou still need to figure out?", "Q&A: What are common questions about the product, and answers to those\nquestions?. This is a good pl ace to note key decisions.\nOther considerations: This is a catch-all for anything else, such as if you\nmake a key decision to remove or add to the project\u2019s scope.\nThe exact format of a PRD varies company to company, but the overall\ncontent is similar. Let\u2019s dig into each section in more detail.\nTitle and Change History\nThe PRD\u2019s header contains the title, which is a unique, identifying name for\nthe project. This might be a code name or it might be something simple, like\n\u201cMoove r Web App\u201d for the first version.\nThe change history is just a way to quickly tell if there\u2019s new information so\nthat readers don\u2019t have to reread the entire document only to find out\nnothing\u2019s changed. Some wiki tools have automatic change-tracking widgets,\nso if you\u2019re writing your PRD online, this section is automatically written for\nyou.\nOverview and Objectives\nNext, you write an overview paragraph that will be very similar to the first\nparagraph of the press release you wrote. It will describe what this project is\nand why you\u2019re doing it now. You\u2019ll also create a short bulleted list\nexplicitly listing what you want the customer to get out of this project and\nwhat internal goals you\u2019re trying to achieve\u2014your objectives.\nSuccess Metrics\nYou\u2019ll also explicitly list the most important success metrics, the key\nperformance indicators that you will need to be able to measure to figure out", "if you\u2019ve achieved our goals.\nAs you start to write the PRD, you might find you have a general sense of\nyour goals (increase the number of users), but not necessarily a detailed goal\n(increase our user base by 10%). Write whatever you can and add some\nplaceholder indicator, like \u201c???\u201d if you\u2019re not certain or need to more clearly\ndefine something. You will also call out this uncertainty in the \u201cOpen Issues\u201d\nsection.\nNew PMs often make the mistake of listing every possible metric they could\nmeasure. Instead, focus on the key success metrics you want to watch for, and\nlater in the PRD as part of the features section or within the Q&A, list the\nspecific metrics you want to measure that will affect the success metrics.\nMessaging\nMessaging is how you\u2019ll explain the product to a current or new customer in\na short sentence, and we\u2019ll cover it more in Chapter 8. It\u2019s quite likely that\nyour product messaging won\u2019t be clearly defined at the start of the project.\nTake a stab at writing something, indicate it is tentative/uncertain, if it is, and\nadd figuring out the exact messaging to the \u201cOpen Issues\u201d section.\nTimeline/Release Planning\nEven though you\u2019re most likely not acting as a project manager and owning\nthe project schedule, you\u2019ll want to include some rough timing information\nhere and eventually provide a link to the full schedule. Maybe your marketing\nand sales team want to release the product for a holiday push\u2014this means it\nneeds to be for sale by mid-November. Knowing that date might significantly\nimpact your development planning and how much you\u2019re able to build and\ntest in time.", "Personas\nCall out the key personas this product is intended for. If you have personas\ndefined elsewhere, link to the full personas and remind the reader of the key\ntraits in the PRD. If they\u2019re not fully defined elsewhere, define them here so a\nreader understands what the eventual customers will be like, and their goals.\nUser Scenarios and Storytelling\nNow we come to the secret sauce of our PRD format: user scenarios. We\nbelieve user scenarios will help you write PRDs a cut above  everyone\nelse\u2019s, making people want to read them. In a user scenario, you\u2019ll combine\npersonas, customer development, and empathy to write full-paragraph stories\nabout how your customers will use your product in different scenarios.\nStories are the oldest form of entertainment we have, and scientists have\nargued that narrative experiences are the basis for far more of our lives than\nsystematic logic. Think about the last bad presentation you saw. Chances are\nthe presenter had slides chock-full of bullet points and just read each\none. After three minutes, you were checking your email, daydreaming about\nbeing anywhere but in that seat. And when you looked at the bottom of his\nslides and saw \u201c3/101,\u201d  you started praying for a fire to get out of the\nroom. Poorly presented content can make even the most fascinating of\nsubjects boring.\nConversely, think about a TED Talk. These presenters easily hold your\nattention for 15\u201320 m inutes and make you want to hear more. Each starts with\nthe presenter sharing a personal detail about her life, and the slides, if there\nare any, are images with no text. Instead of reading bullets, we listen to the\nworld the presenter crafts for us and imagine ourselves in it. TED Talks are\nformatted as stories, and these stories engage our brains.", "There\u2019s scientific evidence that our brains are wired to think in stories, not\nlists of bullets. Scientists have found that just reading a list of bullet points\nactivates the language-processing parts of the brain (Broca\u2019s area and\nWernicke\u2019s area), but when we read a story, areas in the brain that we\u2019d use\nwhen experiencing the events are activated, too. If we read about a person\nwalking down the street, the same parts of the brain that activate when we\nwalk down the street will activate. Stories let us imagine another\u2019s\nexperience.\nOne of the big reasons a product manager needs to communicate effectively\nis to make everyone on the team empathetic with the customer so that they can\nclearly understand the customer\u2019s needs and how the product fits into his life.\nWriting stories to talk about the customer and the product you\u2019re building is\nthe most effective way to help your team empathize with the customer\nbecause it makes your teams\u2019 brains behave as if they\u2019re the customer,\nimplicitly communicating the results of your customer-development work.\nStorytelling also provides a way to take vague oppor tunities and raw data\nand make sense of it. When we\u2019re young, we\u2019re taught that there\u2019s one right\nanswer to a problem. 2 + 2 = 4. Even in English class, we\u2019re taught to write\nto one right answer: write an intro, hypothesis, supporting data, and\nconclusion. The way most schools work are a relic of preparing students to\nwork on assembly lines where there is only one way to do e ach task.\nProduct management isn\u2019t like that. We have a lot of seemingly\ndisconnected data that we have to weave together to create a product\nnarrative. And there\u2019s not always one perfectly clear, right answer for every\nproblem. Instead, we want to focus on the customer\u2019s underlying needs and\nmotivations to make sure whatever answers Design and Engineering come up\nwith will solve the problem. Stories are an effective way to give meaning to", "data and to express that need in an understandable way. They let us imagine a\nworld that doesn\u2019t exist and think about the steps we\u2019ll take to get there\u2014\nwhich is also useful when crafting a product roadmap.\nWriting user scenarios is a great way to turn a list of customer needs and\nproduct requirements into a format that others will understand and want to\nread. Storytelling will help you not only craft great PRDs but also give\neffective presentations, explain your product clearly, and more.\nCrafting Great Stories\nFortunately, good stories aren\u2019t hard to write! By reading book s, watching\nmovies, and just being human, you already implicitly know how to tell a\ngreat story. Let\u2019s make that knowledge explicit. All stories have a similar\nstructure. They first give you context: they set up the world. For a user\nscenario, who\u2019s the persona? Remind us quickly about the customers that\npersona represents. What situation is he in? What are the key details we need\nto know\u2014Is he in his car? Holding a baby?\nThe transition from the setup to the next part of the story, action, is the\n\u201cinciting incident.\u201d The inciting incident is when conflict shows up. What\nproblem causes the persona to need your product, or to need a specific\nfeature in your product if he was already using it in the setup? Why does he\nthink to use your product? If he\u2019s a new customer, how will he find/buy your\nproduct?\nNow is the action section. This is where \u201cstuff\u201d happens. When the persona\nis using the product, what\u2019s he doing? What happens as he tries to use it?\nWhat roadblocks or conflicts does he encounter while trying to use the\nproduct, and what product features help him eliminate those roadblocks? In a\nuser scenario, this is where you\u2019ll justify why various other features are", "important.\nFinally, what\u2019s the result? Now that he\u2019s addressed his need, how does his\nworld change? It\u2019s fine if it\u2019s a small change, not every product is saving the\nworld. \u201cHaving scratched his itch with the Acme backscratcher, Jeff puts his\nbackscratcher down within easy reach, knowing it\u2019s the perfect tool to\nscratch his back.\u201d Hopefully you see how even that simple result implies that\nwe\u2019ll achieve a customer satisfaction/engagement goal in the end.\nSetup. Action. Result. That\u2019s it. The challenge is in the execution! As you\nwrite the story, include the relevant details to help a reader imagine the\nsituation you\u2019re describing, but just like when writing personas, you don\u2019t\nneed to include every possible detail. If you\u2019re not sure what to include, start\nby writing a detailed story and then begin eliminating details. If the overall\nmeaning doesn\u2019t change and the customer need/how the product addresses it\nis still clear, then you likely don\u2019t need those details.\nWrite your stories so that if a customer in your target persona were to read\nit, she\u2019d go, \u201cI\u2019ve been in that situation before, and this product sounds\nfantastic!\u201d Also, your customers likely don\u2019t know your jargon, so avoid\nusing it as much as possible. This will also help other stakeholders to\nunderstand the story clearly\u2014there\u2019ll be no ambiguity because you used\njargon they don\u2019t recognize.\nLast, as we\u2019ve mentioned before, be authentic. You want your stories to be\nreal and believable, as that will help you figure out your potential\nweaknesses, both in terms of execution and where your customer might\nencounter friction. Once you know your weaknesses, you can take steps to\naddress them!\nLike product management, crafting great stories is easy to learn but can take\na lifetime to master. Keep using stories for your PRDs, presentations, and", "more, and you\u2019ll become a better and better storyteller.\nWriting User Scenarios\nIn a PRD, you\u2019ll likely write multiple user scenarios covering different\npersonas and their use cases. Your MVP definition will help you figure out\nthe most important stories to write and what features to focus on in those\nstories\u2014each use case or major aspect of a use case will be one user\nscenario. If you find yourself not mentioning features that are on your MVP\nlist, adjust your list accordingly. Everything in your MVP list should be in the\nuser scenarios, but not every feature called out in the user scenarios will be\npart of the MVP. If you narrate how each feature will help the user win\u2014that\nis, how will customers will use it to address their problems\u2014you\u2019ll make\nthe feature\u2019s value clear to your readers. For new products or features, don\u2019t\nforget about the onboarding part of the user scenario: How will a customer\nfirst encounter this product and learn to use it?\nThere are three key tips to keep in mind when writing user scenarios. First,\nremember that your goal is to make readers feel like they\u2019re sitting next to\neach persona, using the product in each scenario. Provide the relevant detail\nso that readers know what\u2019s going on in the customer\u2019s life when they use the\nproduct, but don\u2019t drown the reader in unnecessary detail.\nSecond, you want these stories to be as truthful as you can imagine, as being\nauthentic will help you get the best possible understanding of your customer\nso that you can make smart product decisions\u2014we\u2019re reiterating this because\nit\u2019s that important. If one of your product requirements is a 100-page user\nmanual, is that reasonable? When was the last time you read a product\nmanual? Why should we believe the characters in your user scenario will\nread a long manual?", "We once read a PRD where each user scenario ended with \u201cand then the\ncustomer tells all her friends about the product and everyone buys one.\u201d\nWhile it\u2019s nice to have a happy ending, that wasn\u2019t authentic about what\npeople actually did! Instead, try to be realistic about what impact each\npersona\u2019s product use will have related to your goal. A realistic statement is,\n\u201cBecause this is an ongoing problem and the customer was so happy with our\ntrial product, she signed up for the monthly plan.\u201d\nBeing authentic can also help you eliminate unnecessary product features. If\nyou find yourself trying to force what you thought was a key feature into the\nstory, that\u2019s a great hint that the feature isn\u2019t essential.\nLast, do not define in too much detail or be too prescriptive about what the\nsolution entails. As we\u2019ll discuss more later, we want to leave the PRD\nfocused on goals and requirements rather than specific solutions to a\nproblem. Design and Engineering will figure out the right solution to help the\ncustomer achieve her goals and to meet your requirements. For example,\nrather than describing how a customer turns a doorknob on a restroom door\nto leave, describe how the customer exits the restroom with clean hands.\nMaybe Design will conclude that using her foot to open the door is a much\nbetter solution than a doorknob in this case. Being prescriptive to Design or\nEngineering is an easy way to get those teams annoyed with you\u2014you need\nto trust them to do t heir jobs.\nRequirements/Features In and Features Out\nNext up in the PRD structure is a feature list, which is sometimes also called\na list of requirements or, more confusingly, user stories (these are not\nactually stories). This section is a list of what features you\u2019re going to build\ninto the product, ideally with some rough prioritizing around essential, really", "want, and nice to hav e.\nYou already have the basis for this: your MVP definition list. Each of the\nitems on your MVP list should be prioritized as essential. Your user\nscenarios will provide the rest of the list\u2014go back through them and\nexplicitly break down the prose into tasks. Note that the prioritization labels\naren\u2019t set in stone. As you develop the product and share early versions with\ncustomers for feedback, your feature prioritization will likely change.\nIt\u2019s OK if you don\u2019t have the full knowledge for how to break down the top-\nlevel tasks into specific subtasks. When you share the PRD with the design\nand engineering leads, you can work with them to break down each item into\nmore specific user stories.\nJust like the user scenarios, you\u2019ll want to avoid being prescriptive and\ninstead focus on goals and requirements. An easy way to do that is to write\neach item in this format: \u201cAs a <persona>, I want <specific feature goal> so\nthat <reason>.\u201d Some PMs prefer to use the Given-When-Then format:\n\u201cGiven <some context>, when <some action is done>, then <a set of\nobservable behaviors happens>.\u201d While Given-When-Then makes it easier\nthan other ways of writing requirements to tell when the user story is\nimplemented completely, be careful, as the When and Then blocks can easily\nbecome prescriptive.\nRegardless of what format you choose for your user stories, it should be\nclear what the feature will do and how to measure success/proper\nimplementation of the feature.\nWe\u2019ve found it also useful to explicitly list \u201cfeatures out\u201d\u2014that is, what\nyou\u2019re not doing and why. For one, multiple readers might ask about adding a\nfeature/supporting a use case, and this preempts the question. Second, if you\nchoose to reduce the scope of the product and cut out a feature, you will note", "the feature, that decision, and the date on this list. This list can also be a\nsource of inspiration for the next product iteration. It\u2019s also a great place to\nwrite down suggestions others give you that don\u2019t fit in the current scope so\nthat the people who made the suggestions feel like you listened to their\nfeedback.\nDesigns\nHaving defined the product\u2019s requirements, in the design section you start to\nlook at the solutions. Even though you don\u2019t want to be prescriptive,\nsometimes it\u2019s effective to create a low-quality, high-level \u201cnapkin sketch\u201d of\na possible design to help everyone understand what you\u2019re talking about. A\npicture can be worth a thousand words! The design section is the place to\ninclude those sketches.\nWe\u2019ll cover working with the design team in the next chapter, but we\nrecommend making these sketches very rough so the designers don\u2019t think\nyou\u2019re trying to do their job! And even if you were a designer before\nbecoming a product manager, you\u2019ll want to make your sketches rough. You\nneed to trust that the design team will do a better job designing a solution\nthan you will. You\u2019ll add links to the actual designs as they become\navailable.\nOpen Issues, Q&A, and Other Considerations\nThe last few sections in the PRD are a catch-all. Especially on your first\ndraft, there are likely some parts of the project you\u2019re unsure of, from what\nyour specific success-metric goals are to if you should include a use case or\nnot. Note these questions under Open Issues.\nAs you discuss your PRD with others, you\u2019ll find some common questions", "come up again and again. Include a Q&A to provide the answers. If you\ncreated a product Q&A to go with the press release, you might already have\na good start to this section! The Q&A is also a great place to address edge\ncases\u2014how will you handle them?\nThe last part of the PRD is a general Other section in case something comes\nup that doesn\u2019t fit anywhere else. As you write the PRD, we recommend\nincluding all of these headers even if the only content is \u201cnothing yet\u201d so that\nthey\u2019re there when you need them.\nUsing a PRD\nNow that you have a PRD, here\u2019s how to use it to get stakeholder buy-in and\nas a tool for communication with your team/company.\nWe recommend you write the first draft of your PRD in a private format,\nsuch as a Word doc or a non-public Google Doc. It will change the most in\nthe first few drafts, and you don\u2019t want someone stumbling upon it and\npanicking! You\u2019ll define the core of the product in these early drafts, and you\nwant to make sure everything on the page is coming from the work you\u2019ve\ndone to identify, validate, and scope the oppor tunity.\nAfter you\u2019ve written it, you\u2019ll start sharing it with others for feedback. Even\nthough you\u2019ll want to listen and address their feedback collaboratively,\nremember that product isn\u2019t design by committee. You\u2019re the person\nresponsible for the product, and you should approach these discussions from\na perspective of \u201cThis is what I believe is right. Did I miss anything?\u201d as\noppos ed to \u201cWhat do y ou think we should build?\u201d\nHowever, this does not mean you should approach this sharing process as\njust telling people, \u201cThis is what we\u2019re building. Now, go do i t.\u201d You\u2019ll want\nto solicit and address feedback, both to make the product better and to keep", "your relationship with various stakeholders productive and respectful.\nThe first people to share your PRD with are leads and fellow product\nmanagers. People who have been at the company longer, have experience\nwith the product, or have more experience in general might have valuable\ninsight to make the product\u2014or the path to getting it built\u2014be tter.\nOnce your team is on board, engage the other key stakeholders, such as the\ndesign and engineering leads. Again, view this as a conversation\u2014you\u2019re\nseeking their feedback, and you\u2019ll incorporate their thoughts into the PRD.\nPerhaps the engineering manager will note a technical issue you need to\nfigure out, and you\u2019ll add that to the Open Issues section. Or maybe the\ndesign lead will have an idea for a solution that changes the technical scope.\nMaybe the marketing lead will really want you to have something for a\ncertain release date. They might also ask you to break down one of your user\nstories into more detail to make the project\u2019s scope explicitly clear.\nSometimes you hear people say that a PM owns the problem, Design owns\nthe solution, and Engineering implements it. We\u2019ve found a much better\napproach is to define the problem and generate solutions together. You, the\nPM, might take the first stab at the problem\u2019s definition, but that doesn\u2019t mean\nwhat you write is perfect and that Design doesn\u2019t have valid input. Similarly,\nif you used to be an engineer, perhaps you\u2019ll have a valuable insight as to\nhow Engineering could implement a solution. When conflicts arise,\nremember your core role and focus on the product\u2019s requirements, not how to\nbuild it. A lot of conflict comes about when someone tries to do someone\nelse\u2019s job, such as a PM trying to design the solution or a designer wanting to\nchange the product\u2019s scope.\nAfter discussing the PRD with this group, you should all be in agreement\nabout what you\u2019re trying to build and why, along with what your key success", "metrics are. You should have a basic idea about if the project is feasible with\nthe defined scope and on the desired timeline. You\u2019ll also likely come up\nwith various questions and answers for the Q&A section, and the other leads\nmight have ideas that impact the user scenarios and feature list.\nNow is the time to start sharing the PRD more broadly. If you have an\ninternal wiki, move the PRD to a wiki page and make that the product\u2019s\nhomepage, or, at the very least, link to it from the product\u2019s homepage. Start\nsharing the PRD with the teams who will be working on it. Be sure to\nincorporate their feedback, as people in the weeds day to day often have\nvaluable practical insights.\nLast, it\u2019s quite possible that you\u2019ll be asked to share the PRD with a\nbroader group, be it at a company all-hands meeting or even at a board\nmeeting. In this situation, don\u2019t read the PRD or your user scenarios to the\naudience verbatim. Instead, distill the PRD down to the essence of what\nyou\u2019re doing and why, and present that information to the group. The press\nrelease you wrote can be a great guide. It\u2019s OK to call out specific things to\nmake the project\u2019s scope clear, but try to leave plenty of time for questions.\nAnd while you\u2019re sharing the PRD with broader audiences, the design and\nengineering teams are starting to actually work on the product! In the next\ncouple of chapters we\u2019ll look at how you\u2019ll work with them to shepherd the\nproduct.\nMOOVER.IO\u2019S DOCUMENTS\nAfter validating the idea we came up with in Chapter 3, that Moover should\nadd in-app messaging so that customers don\u2019t have to play phone tag with\nmoving companies, we\u2019re going to clearly define our ideas. We\u2019ll do so by\nwriting an imaginary press release, working on an MVP list, and then writing", "the PRD.\nSample Press Release\nMove on Your Schedule With Moover\u2019s Latest Update\nThe leading app-based moving service now provides easy in-app communication with moving\ncompanies.\nMoover, the iPhone app bringing moving into the smartphone age, is proud to release its latest update.\nThis update removes the need to exchange phone calls and emails with moving companies, completely\ndigitizing the moving experience. Rather than having to schedule a phone call and email photos back in\nforth, with Moover you can now message with each moving company in-app, dealing with questions and\ncontracts at your convenience to finish planning your move.\nSince its release six months ago, Moover has transformed urban moving. Instead of having to search\nout moving companies, call them, and deal with an annoying game of phone tag just to get an accurate\nbid, Moover brings moving companies to you. Enter a few details about your home and when you want\nto move, and moving companies will compete for your business, with bids appearing in-app. The latest\nupdate simplifies the process by providing in-app messaging with each moving company so that you can\nshare photos and address your home\u2019s unique traits. This new feature ensures accountability and lets\nMoover guarantee that the bid you receive is the price you pay.\nProduct manager Jane Doe believes, \u201cin-app messaging is the biggest win for customers since we\nreleased Moover. It means you can provide answers to the moving company\u2019s questions when you\u2019re\nhome at night, thinking about the move, instead of having to stress during the day to call the moving\ncompany at work between meetings.\u201d\nRecent customer John Smith tried a prerelease version of messaging and \u201cstarted planning the move\nat 11pm, sent photos of the apartment two days later at 2am, and moved the next weekend.\u201d He went\non to share, \u201cThis is the third time I\u2019ve moved, and even though I have more furniture now than ever\nbefore, this was the first hassle-free move I\u2019ve had.\u201d\nDownload Moover from the App Store today to get started planning your first hassle-free move.\nSample MVP List\nGoal: Add in-app messaging so that customers cay stay in-app and don\u2019t", "have to exchange phone calls/emails with a moving company to get a bid or\ncomplete a move.\nMVP Requirements\nInitiate a conversation with the other party so that I can address\nquestions to provide a more accurate bid or finalize the moving\ndetails.\nSee when there are new messages so that I know I have information\nto deal with.\nRespond to messages to keep a thread going.\nFeatures We Removed from Moover\u2019s MVP\nSend documents like photos, videos, and PDFs as attachments to\nfurther help avoid email while communicating beyond words.\nSee a history of all communication/attachments with each company\nfor accountability and reference.\nSample PRD\nHere\u2019s what the first version of a PRD for our Moove r messaging feature\nlooks like. Notice how we call out an MVP with our prioritized-feature list\nin the PRD, and it\u2019s definitely an uncomfortable MVP. However, the PRD\ndoesn\u2019t just talk about the MVP features. It talks about a range of features to\ngive a complete view of the product and how the product manager expects\ncustomers to use all of the features together. Non-MVP features just have a\nlower priority in the requirements list.\nAs a product manager, you really hope Engineering will be able to do some", "of the lower-priority features to make the overall messaging feature more\nfunctionally complete. But, as long as you get the highest-priority features\ndone, all the personas will be able to achieve their goals, even if it takes a\nlittle more work than if every feature were implemented. This also gives you\nflexibility to release just the MVP version, get feedback, and then adjust what\nyou\u2019re working on next rather than building the entire PRD feature list before\nconsidering the product release-ready.\nTitle\nIn-App M essaging\nChange History\nFirst version\nOverview\nOur mission is to be the Uber of moving companies, making it convenient to\nbook  a move on your smartphone. We\u2019ve done a great job bringing the first\npart of moving to your fingertips\u2014finding vendors and getting initial rough\nbids\u2014bu t we\u2019ve found that there\u2019s a second part. Despite using Moove r, our\ncustomers still have to talk on the phone to figure out details, get exact bids,\nand finalize their moves. That means move prep still has to take place from 9\nto 5. We\u2019re going to bring the second part of the moving process into the\nsmartphone era by adding in-app messaging. This will make it convenient for\nour moving companies and customers to interact to plan details, allowing the\nmoving company to message from 9 to 5 and the customer to reply when\nconvenient.\nObjectives", "Improve customer satisfaction by continuing to reduce the hassle of\nmoving\nIncrease revenue by having more completed moves\nSuccess Metrics\nImprove the number of completed moves by a significant margin.\n[??? What\u2019s our precise goal? 10% ?]\nMessaging\nMoving on your schedule [???]\nTimeline/Release Planning\nSummer is a popu lar time to move, so we want to have at least the MVP done\nby May. That gives us about eight weeks. Ideally we will release the MVP by\nApril so that we have an iteration or two of the feature by the time the\nmoving season really starts.\nPersonas\nOur primary target is Ant Moving, our mid-sized moving company. They\u2019re\nthe ones who will have to ask for more information, so we need to make this\neasier for them than using the phone. Really Busy Rob is our second target,\nour persona who doesn\u2019t mind paying a premium to use app services over\ntraditional services. We\u2019ll need to provide an intuitive\nmessaging/notification system so that he doesn\u2019t have to look up a help page\nabout how to talk with the moving company.\nUser Scenarios", "Ant Answers a Bid\nLinda is the office manager at Ant Moving. Ant Moving signed up for\nMoove r when it first became available, and it\u2019s given the company a nice\nbump in its business: Moove r is now promoting Ant to potential clients,\nwithout Ant having had to do anything more. Linda is happy with Moove r and\nis willing to be a first adopter on new features to help the business keep\ngrowing.\nCurrently, Linda gets an email from Moove r when there\u2019s a new bid\nrequest. The email has the basic information for the bid and a link to the\nMoove r web dashboard. When Linda clicks the link, she\u2019s taken to a website\nthat lets her reply to the bid, see its status: unanswered, bid sent, or customer\naccepted/rejected. She can then link back to a master list of all bid requests\nreceived and the status.\nIf the customer accepts the bid, Linda then receives the customer\u2019s contact\ninfo, and she can call him to finalize details and give a more accurate bid.\nAlthough Linda\u2019s bids are pretty good, sometimes unexpected things happen.\nMoove r has the standard field for how many stairs are in each location, but it\ndoesn\u2019t account for tight staircases you can\u2019t fit furniture dow n, for example.\nNow, with Moover\u2019s latest version, when Linda gets a bid request she still\nlooks over the basic information and clicks a link to open the dashboard.\nHowever, there\u2019s a new group on the customer page with messaging\ninformation. Since she noticed the customer said he has stairs inside the\ncurrent unit, Linda uses the messaging tool to ask the customer if he could\ntake a photo of the stairwell and the rooms upstairs, with the furniture inside\nof them, so that Linda can look for any potential problems.\nRob is the customer book ing the move. He receives a notification that", "there\u2019s a new question waiting for him in Moove r. He checks it and makes a\nreminder to take photos when he\u2019s home that evening. At home, Rob takes\nand sends the requested photos to Ant.\nThe next day, Linda gets an email from Rob, via Moove r, with the requested\ninformation. The stairwell looks quite large, with no sharp turns, and there\u2019s\nno obnoxious furniture upstairs that could cause a problem. Linda determines\nher bid, provides it to Rob via the dashboard, and moves on to the next\npotential customer. Being an office manager at a moving company keeps\nLinda busy! She appreciates that the new Moove r messaging feature lets her\nnot play phone tag with customers, too!\nMoove r archives the conversation so that later, should Rob accept the bid\nand need to reference his photos, he can look them up on his customer page\non the web dashboard. Furthermore, Linda can continue the conversation\nwith Rob since he accepted the bid, finalizing any details. If he\u2019d rejected\nAnt\u2019s bid, Linda could see the previous conversation but not initiate a new\nconversation. While that means she can\u2019t reach out later and offer him a\ncoupon, it also provides her incentive to give Rob the best price up front.\nRob Answers Ant\u2019s Questions and Asks for Insurance\nInformation\nLiving in downtown Metropolis, Rob loves app services. He uses Lyft to get\naround, Rinse for his laundry, and more. He\u2019s about to move apartments\ndowntown, and he\u2019s trying Moove r for the first time.\nAfter downloading Moove r and answering a few questions about his old\nand new places, he sits back and waits to receive bids. The next day, he gets\na notification from Ant Moving asking to see photos of his staircase and\nupstairs rooms. No worries\u2014he takes the photos that night and sends them", "in-app to Ant. Ant gives him a bid, and it looks good.\nHowever, that afternoon he gets an email from his landlord, reminding him\nthat moving companies have to meet a certain minimum insurance\nrequirement to comply with the homeowner association (HOA) rules, and he\nhas to provide a copy of the company\u2019s insurance certificate unless it\u2019s an\nHOA-approved mover. Ugh! Ant isn\u2019t on the approved list, but its bid is half\nthe amount of the HOA-approved movers.\nRob goes to the Open Bids section on his app, and creates a new message\nto Ant. He provides them with the requirements, asks if they meet them, and\nasks if they\u2019d be willing to provide a copy of their insurance information for\nthe HOA if so.\nLinda at Ant gets the new message notification and is prepared. She\u2019s had\nthis request from other clients. She double-checks the numbers, Ant meets\nthem, and she replies with that confirmation. Since she already has a copy of\nAnt\u2019s insurance as a PDF, she attaches it for Rob, too.\nRob gets a notification about this reply, and when he checks it he sees that\neverything looks good. He even can open and save the PDF attachment. He\naccepts the bid and sends the insurance PDF to his landlord and the building\nHOA to get the move process started on their end.\nLinda promptly sends him the contract PDF. He saves it and signs it using a\nPDF app on his phone, and he sends the completed contract back to Linda via\nMoove r\u2019s message attachment feature.

As product managers, it\u2019s easy to focus\non the customer-facing side of defining the initial problem\u2014and then, later, actually overseeing the\nbuildout of the solution. But the portion of work and preparation in between can be the difference\nbetween a product properly launching to address the actual problem, and going off track before the\nbuild-out even begins.\nClearly defining the problem and requirements through well-organized documentation as described in\nthis chapter is one way to properly prepare your team. Consider supplementing your documentation with\nan experiential immersion with your entire team.\nAn experiential immersion is simply finding a real-world experience that your entire team can go\nthrough together that will allow you all to really live through the problem you\u2019re solving for. Even if your\nteam members are generally not your target market and aren\u2019t who you\u2019re designing your solution for,\nyou should all become method actors and live as if you were.\nIn the case of Moover, your team could actually become a moving company for a day. Set up a\nsimulated office for your moving company. Assign roles to different people\u2014including those who play\nthe customer. Spend a couple of hours doing the type of back-office work that you might envision at a", "Moover client moving company. If the Moover team were to go through this experiential immersion,\nthey might start to get an even keener understanding of why the problem they\u2019re solving for needs to be\naddressed. Or even better, it might bring up serious questions about whether any of your core\nassumptions about the problem you\u2019re solving for should be reconsidered.\nHow to do this?\n1. As a team, pick the core problem that you feel you\u2019re ultimately solving for.\n2. Identify a customer persona that experiences this problem often.\n3. Create a scenario where your team can \u201cact\u201d and simulate actually being the customer\nexperiencing the problem.\n4. Allow your team to live through this problem together for a while\u2014at least a couple of hours.\n5. Discuss as a team what it felt like to live the problem and whether any of your core\nassumptions have been even further validated, or need to be readdressed.", "So far, you\u2019ve been responsible for each step in the product-design life\ncycle. You\u2019ve found and validated an oppor tunity, communicated it to your\nstakeholders, and gotten everyone onboard. Now we\u2019ll shift into the\nexecution phase, which starts by figuring out the product\u2019s user experience\nwith the design team. A lot of thought goes into this phase to ensure we craft\na great product! Put another way, now that we\u2019ve figured out we\u2019re building\na house, we need to draw up blueprints and sketches, to figure out everything\nfrom where the toilets go, to how thick a wall needs to be to support the roof,\nto how we want to decorate.", "WHAT IS USER EXPERIENCE DESIGN?\nPut simply, user experience (UX) design is about how we interact and\nengage with the product. Because building products is fundamentally about\nmaking a new experience or making an existing experience better, a good\nuser experience is fundamental to a great product. This includes everything\nfrom the box\u2014if there is one\u2014for the product, to how a customer achieves\nher goals within the product, to what the product looks and feels like.\nThere are two primary approaches to design. The first is that the customer\nshould adapt to the product, and the second is the product should work in a\nway the user expects/understands. For a long time, UX took a backseat to\nengineering. Because the engineers who built the product were also\nresponsible for the design, the UX directly represented how the product\nworked internally. In those cases, if there was a design team it was relegated\nto making nice icons for the interface the engineering team created. This is\nwhy many people think design is just about making something look pretty.\nPeople are adaptable, and this approach worked\u2014a nd continues to work\u2014\njust fine for many products, but the result is a product that most people don\u2019t\nwant to use. Figure 6-1 shows an application where the UX matches the\nengineering. Each field and option in the UX maps directly to the software\u2019s\ninternals, and the result is a confusing mess. With some time and effort (and\ncheat sheets), we all could figure out how to use this product, but very few of\nus would want to.\nOver the past few years, the second type of design, called user-centered\ndesign, has become far more popu lar, and it\u2019s what we\u2019ll focus on. In this\ntype of design, the product\u2019s UX is a well-thought-out solution to help the end\nuser effectively achieve her goal using the product. Compare the design of\nthe original iPhone to the Blackberry and other smartphones of the time, for", "example.\nFigure 6-1. This app\u2019s UX is a visual representation of its internals, and the results aren\u2019t pretty!\nIn many ways, Apple\u2019s iPod and iPhone are responsible for the design\npriority change. Mac OS put design front and center for years, always trying\nto create a great experience, thereby building a loyal customer base. But its\nmarket share was so small most people never had a chance to appreciate\nwhat a difference a good UX made\u2014software design on Windows tended to\nreflect how things worked internally. When the iPod came out, its\nfunctionality was the same as that of many other MP3 players, but its overall\nexperience, from putting music on to it to finding and playing the song you\nwant, was so great it crushed the competition. (Figure 6-2 shows the original\niPod\u2019s competition.) The iPhone kicked this into high gear with an incredibly\nintuitive touch experience. Even toddlers can use iOS. Apple\u2019s earnings\nreports show the result of this focus on user-centered design.", "Figure 6-2. The Creative Nomad Jukebox had a 6GB hard drive compared to the iPod\u2019s 5GB, but can\nyou guess how you\u2019d select a song? User experience matters!\nAs people used the iPod, the iPhone, and other products with a great user-\ncentered design, they came to appreciate how much easier the products were\nto use, letting them achieve their goals\u2014from listening to music to checking\ntheir voicemail\u2014faster. People began to want great experiences in all of\ntheir products, whether it was HR software or a thermostat. When faced with\ntwo products that solve a problem, they often picked the better-designed one.\nSlack, for example, has seen exponential growth by taking a product that\u2019s\nbeen around for years\u2014group chat\u2014and building a much better UX around\nit. This trend has led to far larger design teams and making design a full part\nof the product-development life cycle rather than an afterthought.\nBack in Chapter 2 when we discussed enterprise vs. consumer software,", "we mentioned that for a long time UX design mattered very little, in\nenterprise products especially. As long as the product solved a problem,\ncustomers would adapt and learn how to use it. But as people started to\nexperience well-designed UX in the consumer products they used at home,\nthey wanted better experiences at work. This had led to significant disruption\nin enterprise software lately, with new, well-designed tools like Basecamp\nreplacing big, traditional tools like Microsoft SharePoint.\nSo what goes into making a great, user-centered experience? At a high\nlevel, UX designers need to understand the customers, come up with ideas\nfor how to address their needs, help define requirements for the solution, and\ncreate a specification that they work with Engineering to build. This should\nsound similar to a product manager\u2019s role, and it absolutely is. In fact, this is\nwhy some start-ups won\u2019t hire a PM\u2014they feel a UX designer can do it all\u2014\nor conversely a start-up will want a PM to handle design tasks. However, the\ndifference is in the details, and while the roles are complementary, they\nreally do n eed different skills!\nProduct Managers vs. Designers\nTo use an analogy, a PM is like the typical president of the United States and\nthe lead designer is like the typical secretary of state. This fits nicely with\nGuy Kawasaki\u2019s claim that a product manager has \u201call of the responsibility\nand none of the power.\u201d The president will set policy goals and provide\nreasons he picked those goals, but it\u2019s up to the secretary of state to work out\nthe details of achieving the goals. The secretary of state will also make\nrecommendations to the president to help him make good decisions and craft\nuseful goals. Essentially, the president focuses on strategy and not tactics,\nand the secretary of state is tactical. The president works with people beyond", "the secretary of state, too, be it the secretary of education or Congress\u2014he\nhas to keep a broad view every day! And while the secretary of state isn\u2019t\nresponsible for education, she should still have some knowledge of the\npresident\u2019s goals for the secretary of education\u2014she can\u2019t just work in a\nvacuum.\nThe product manager owns and writes the product requirements and goals.\nShe will lead the product requirements document (PRD), roadmap, cross-\nteam communication, and sometimes even the budget to help get the product\nbuilt. The lead designer will own the user-experience strategy: What UX do\nwe want to create, both short-term and long-term, to help deliver the best\noverall product experience? However, the lead designer will also likely do\nuser research and come up with requirements. Her research can help the PM\nfigure out what the final product requirements are, and design will also be\ntactical and determine how to meet those requirements. Like the typical\npresident, the PM will work frequently with every team, not just the lead\ndesigner, to shepherd the product, so the PM will have to balance everyone\u2019s\nneeds. And a good lead designer will have a basic understanding of the\nproduct\u2019s business context so that she\u2019s not working in a vacuum and can help\nthe product manager understand tradeoffs for different design decisions.\nTHE DESIGN PROCESS AND KEY DESIGN SKILLS\nThe design process generally breaks dow n into six primary phases:\n1. User research\n2. Information architecture\n3. Interaction design\n4. Prototyping", "5. Visual design\n6. Content strategy\nEach phase requires a different dom inant skill. While some of these skills are\ncomplementary, you rarely find one person who\u2019s great at every part of the\ndesign process. That means you usually have a design team with different\npeople specialized in each tactical element, or some combination of\nelements.\nDuring each phase, you\u2019ll give feedback on the work the design team\ncreates, answer questions about the project\u2019s requirements and\ncustomer/business needs for the design team, facilitate any needed\ncommunication with the engineering lead and other stakeholders, and\nshepherd the process along. One way to help keep things moving is by having\na reoccurring Design/Engineering/Product meeting each week for the project,\nbut make it clear you\u2019re always available to answer questions the design\nteam has beyond those meetings.\nLet\u2019s look more at the typical design process and the types of designers\nyou\u2019ll encounter. The design process starts before you\u2019ve written the PRD, as\nyou work with the lead designer and a user researcher, if that\u2019s not the same\nperson, to figure out the right strategy and scope of your oppor tunity. Just like\na product manager, a user researcher is focused on understanding the\ncustomer, what his needs and goals are, what he\u2019s using now to address those\nneeds, and what we might do to make his life better. The lead designer and a\nuser researcher will often accompany you to customer interviews, and you\u2019ll\nwork together to figure out the user value you want to deliver, business goals\nto focus on, and the features/functionality you need to meet those goals and\ndeliver the value. They will likely have valuable input to your PRD, and as", "we mentioned in Chapter 5, take that input constructively.\nUser researchers also help with user testing. That is, later in the design\nprocess, once you\u2019ve built a prototype, user testing will help you learn how\nwell the customer accomplishes key tasks using your prototype.\nOnce you\u2019ve figured out what to build with a user researcher\u2019s help, an\ninformation architecture (IA) designer will figure out how to model and\norganize the data we\u2019re working with. IA is very much a structure step,\nasking what information a user should see first, second, and so on. IA might\ncreate a data model, explaining how the underlying product will conceptually\nbe presented to the customer, along with block diagrams expressing in what\norder to present the information. Figure 6-3 shows a sample IA diagram for\nMoove r\u2019s messaging feature.", "Interaction designers then take the information architecture and figure out\nhow to present it in the product. They\u2019re the ones who focus on how a\ncustomer navigates through the product, what UI controls you use (e.g.,\nshould you use a slider or a text field?), how many steps it takes to achieve\ncommon tasks, and more. As the skill implies, they\u2019re the ones really focused\non how you use the product. It\u2019s quite common to find designers who\nspecialize in IA and interaction design. This is also the step where the\nengineering lead will start to get involved, providing the design team with\nfeedback about the technical feasibility of its designs.\nThe most common delivery from this phase is a set of wireframes. These\nare rough, block diagrams showing how a user will interact with your", "product, like we see in Figure 6-4 for Moove r\u2014we\u2019re showing only one\nwireframe, but typically you\u2019ll have a series representing various views and\nkey interactions. Wireframes help you visualize where your customers will\nfind various pieces of information, how they will navigate through your\nproduct, and more. Wireframes are not interactive, and they might even be\nsketches on paper rather than digital assets.\n", "Design teams will often have prototyping experts who turn these static\nwireframes into interactive prototypes using anything from HTML to\nspecialized tools like Balsamiq and InVision. Prototypes are incredibly\nhelpful for three reasons. First, they help everyone working on the product\ninternally to understand what you\u2019re building, be it people on the direct team,\nyour boss, or beyond. Having something visual is more easily understandable\nthan a written PRD, and having something interactive is even better. Second,\nthe prototype helps Engineering provide more accurate estimates for how\nhard parts of the product will be to build. Using a standard UI control might\ntake minutes to implement whereas a custom control the design team created\nmight take days, for example, and all the teams will have to discuss if the", "custom control is worth the time tradeoff. That decision will then affect the\nprototype. Third, prototypes help with usability testing.\nAfter prototyping, you will have a great idea of how the product will\nwork/flow, but you won\u2019t know what it will look like. Visual design is the\nfocus on how the product will look. Your team\u2019s visual designers will often\nwork in parallel with the people creating wireframes, establishing the\noverall look and feel of your product. They will create mock-ups, like Figure\n6-5, usually based on the wireframes, that look pixel-perfect but aren\u2019t\nfunctional. These mock-ups are designed to help the product\u2019s overall team\ngauge how everything will come together, and the end product will visually\nlook similar to the mock-up.\nVisual design is more than just making the app look pretty, though. Visual\ndesigners need to consider usability (e.g., is the font large enough to read and\nare the buttons large enough to tap accurately on a phone?), emotions\n(conveyed through colors and icons), and consistent brand messaging. Visual\ndesigners will often work with marketing to create a company style guide that\ninfluences everything from customer announcement emails to the marketing\nwebsite to the actual product.\nSometimes visual designers and prototypers will create a higher-fidelity\nprototype using the mock-up and wireframes, giving the prototype a more\nfinished feel to help you judge the product more effectively.\nAfter you\u2019ve created your wireframes and mock-ups for Engineering to\nimplement, a content strategist will help make sure your product is using the\nright media and text, such as how to word an alert. Like visual design,\ncontent strategy applies to marketing, too, and you want to use consistent\nwords and have a consistent tone. It detracts from the overall experience and\ncan confuse your customers because of misaligned expectations if your app is", "very formal and your website is very whimsical. Some companies will have\none copy manager who is responsible for all text, be it in-product or in an ad.\nThe main design process is done when your prototypes and mock-ups are\nvalidated as a solution and Engineering has agreed to their viability. As you\nhand the designs over to Engineering, you will likely discover questions\nabout how part of the product should behave, unanticipated edge cases that\nneed to be designed, new alerts you need the proper wording for, and parts of\nthe design that are problematic to implement.\nYour primary role throughout this process will be facilitator, but you\u2019ll also\nwant to make sure early test customers are happy with the designs and able to\nachieve the product goal satisfactorily. You\u2019ll likely want to keep running a\nmeeting with the design and engineering teams throughout the project to make\nsure everyone is on the same page and to address early user feedback and\nadditional engineering needs. For example, if you have a ship-date deadline,\nyou might need to cut a feature and change part of the product\u2019s design so that\nthe feature doesn\u2019t appear to be missing. The entire design process isn\u2019t truly\ndone until the product ships.\nUsability Testing with Prototypes\nAs your design team builds a design, it\u2019s useful to test various aspects of it\nwith customers when possible to see if the design is easy and pleasant to use\nand ensure that your customer can complete tasks the tester gives them with\nthe design.\nUser researchers and prototypers will work together to perform this testing.\nTools like UserTesting (which lets you get videos of random people that meet\nspecified criteria performing tasks with your website, mobile apps, or\nprototype), and UsabilityHub (which provides data, including heat maps,", "about how people perform tasks with your static mock-ups across different\ncategories) help simplify the task.\nUsability testing is critical to making a successful user-centered design, but\nit isn\u2019t perfect. It doesn\u2019t test for questions like \u201cIs this product valuable to a\ncustomer?\u201d The hypothesis validation you did in Chapter 4 should have\nanswered that type of question. If you\u2019re testing a new feature in isolation\nfrom the main product with a prototype, usability testing won\u2019t test whether\nexisting customers are able to find and use this new feature. It also can\u2019t\naccount for things like taste. A test might reveal that customers are most\nsuccessful when you use an orange-and-green color scheme for the feature,\nbut unless you\u2019re building a pumpkin-themed product, you might choose to\ntrade some usability value for a better aesthetic.\nOnce in a while, even a user-centered design team has to make choices that\nseem more like they force the customer to adapt to the product rather than\nbeing user-centered. Sometimes this is due to an internal limitation, such as\nengineering or design resources. Other times it\u2019s because this choice is in\nline with the company\u2019s vision and general attitude, such as Apple\u2019s not\nproviding removable storage on the iPhone. A great design team will also\nthink about the future and the roadmap, and this might lead to making choices\nin the current product that seem weird but are better for the future, like\nremoving the floppy  drive and serial ports from the original iMac. While\ntesting is important, design is often more of an art than a science.\nHowever, this doesn\u2019t mean you should ship an unusable design because it\u2019s\nin line with your company vision! If a customer can\u2019t use your product to\nsolve his problem, or if it\u2019s very hard to use your product, he\u2019ll look for a\ndifferent solution. Your product must be usable in addition to providing\nutility!", "Just like how you created an oppor tunity hypothesis and then worked to\nvalidate it, design will create various UX possibilities and then work to\nconverge on the main design. Just like your oppor tunity hypothesis, bigger\nideas will need more work to validate. Some small projects might not\nrequire any design iteration. If you\u2019re responsible for the schedule, make sure\nto incorporate the appropriate time for design to iterate.\nWORKING WITH DESIGN\nWhile product and design will often have a fantastic relationship, all too\noften they have a frustrating relationship. Let\u2019s dig into why that happens and\nlook at some tips to help you work well with your design team.\nJudging and Giving Feedback About Design\nAs a PM, you will be expected to give feedback about designs and to have\ninformed opinions. While we highly recommend you take the time to learn\nabout design, reading book s like Donald Norman\u2019s seminal The Design of\nEveryday Things, it is possible to have an educated opinion about design\nwithout being an expert. We can form that opinion by using a framework with\nspecific criteria and then looking at how the design meets those elements.\nThe most important criteria we\u2019re going to set is \u201cDoes this design let the\ncustomer achieve his goal with the least friction possible?\u201d As you look at a\nwireframe and imagine using the product step by step or as you actually try a\nprototype, are you able to accomplish the key tasks the product promises?\nDoes the design ask for irrelevant information or require complex actions\nthat prevent you from achieving your goals?\nAsk yourself this question for every use case, and you\u2019ll be amazed what\nyou find. On some cameras, for example, it\u2019s easy to put the battery in", "backwards because the battery\u2019s a rectangle with no special groove s. The\nonly indication that you\u2019ve put it in wrong is when the camera doesn\u2019t turn\non. A design change might have spared users the hassle of putting their\nbatteries in wrong!\nWith software, is the information users need easily at hand, or are they\nconstantly having to bounce between parts of the app to get the needed data?\nWhat about the sign-up process\u2014do you have a simple one that lets users\nimmediately engage with the app, or do you ask a lot of irrelevant questions\nbefore they can start using it?\nTo go a step further in our criteria, we\u2019re going to recommend using Dieter\nRams\u2019s 10 principles of \u201cgood design.\u201d Rams is a well-known designer,\nprimarily having worked at Braun throughout his career. His designs are\nhighly regarded, he\u2019s influenced numerous designers, including Jony Ive, and\nhis 10 pr inciples are easy to understand.\nGood design is innovative. Technological innovation is constantly creating\noppor tunities for new and innovative designs. This doesn\u2019t mean that you\nneed to reinvent the wheel with every design. Often, there are standard\ndesign elements that will make sense for your product, like a button. But\nespecially when you\u2019re building an innovative product, it\u2019s worth asking if\nyou\u2019re being innovative with your design or applying old design ideas to\nsomething new.\nGood design makes a product useful. We want our products to be used\nand loved, which means they need to be useful. The design has to make the\nproduct functional but also psychologically pleasing. Dental headgear is a\ngreat example of a functional product that\u2019s not psychologically pleasing,", "which means a customer won\u2019t want to use it.\nGood design is aesthetic. Quoting Rams, \u201cThe aesthetic quality of a\nproduct is integral to its usefulness because products are used every day\nand have an effect on people and their well-being. Only well-executed\nobjects can be beautiful.\u201d\nGood design makes a product understandable. Design can help make a\nproduct\u2019s intended function clear, and great design makes the product usable\nwithout any training. When it fails to make the product understandable, the\ncustomer often gets frustrated trying to use the product or remembering how\nto use it.\nGood design is unobtrusive. Products exist to help a customer be awesome\nand achieve a goal, not to be revered by themselves. If a design is neutral\nand restrained, it lets the focus be on the customer rather than calling\nattention to itself.\nGood design is honest. A well-designed product doesn\u2019t make the\ncustomer believe it does something that it doesn\u2019t actually do or that it is\nsomething more valuable than it actually is. Painting the product gold won\u2019t\nmake it actually be as valuable as if it were made out of gold.\nGood design is long-lasting. While it can be tempting to make something\ntrendy and fashionable, good design will last so that even as styles change,\nyour product won\u2019t go the way of the mullet.\nGood design is thorough down to the last detail. You want to think out\nevery aspect so you make sure that no matter how customers interact with", "your product, they\u2019re encountering a great experience.\nGood design is environmentally friendly. Design can help us preserve our\nplanet for future generations by minimizing the resources it needs, whether\nwe\u2019re talking about compute cycles that require power or physical design\nthat needs raw materials.\nGood design is as little design as possible. As Rams puts it, \u201cless, but\nbetter.\u201d As you evaluate a design, ask yourself if you can eliminate\nelements. Focus on reducing the design to its essentials, as that purity and\nsimplicity will help make your products aesthetic, understandable,\nunobtrusive, and honest.\nNot every principle will apply to every design with equal weight. When\nyou\u2019re building an app, you likely don\u2019t care as much about its long-lasting\nor environmentally friendly nature. But when a designer gives you a\nwireframe, prototype, or mock-up and asks what you think, these criteria give\nyou a way to provide thoughtful and precise feedback.\nDesign Relationship Skills\nThe biggest source of conflict is that both product and design feel like they\nrepresent the customer. Both groups do represent the customer, just in\ndifferent ways. Like we said earlier, PMs have to think about the big picture\nand about different teams\u2019 needs, whereas the design lead will be more\ntactical and focused primarily on a great design. A handy way to think about\nthe difference is that product managers focus on the ideal customer, whereas\nlead designers often focus on the ideal user.\nLet\u2019s look at an example to understand the difference. If you were designing", "a keyboard, your goal would be to help users type quickly and accurately.\nThe design team would come up with a fantastic keyboard layout, and it\nalmost certainly wouldn\u2019t be the most common keyboard layout, QWERTY.\nQWERTY has been proven to not be the ideal design for fast or accurate\ntyping.\nBut QWERTY keyboards have been around for a long time. They\u2019re\neverywhere, from your computer to your smartphone to some TV remotes!\nCustomers know how to type on them relatively quickly and accurately. A\nnon-QWERTY keyboard will have a potentially steep learning curve,\nmeaning customers won\u2019t type quickly or accurately while they learn the new\nlayout.\nWhile our design team could come up with a new keyboard layout for the\nideal user whose goal is to type quickly and accurately, the ideal customer\nmost likely wouldn\u2019t buy it because of the short-term tradeoff.\nTo understand customers comprehensively, it\u2019s useful to focus on their\npersonas. In addition to their goals, what other factors are at play that will\naffect the customers\u2019 behavior? In our keyboard example, while their goal\nwas to type quickly and accurately, their prior familiarity with QWERTY is a\nbig factor that affects our product choices.\nSometimes, especially with consumer products, it\u2019s easy for PMs to believe\nthey represent the target persona accurately, even when they don\u2019t. These\nPMs often ignore the details of the persona, using their own taste, not persona\ndetails, to make product decisions. This can be frustrating to designers, as\nthis can make the PM\u2019s decisions feel arbitrary.\nMicromanaging every decision design can cause friction between the design\nteam and the PM, too. PMs are ultimately responsible for the success or\nfailure of the product, and that responsibility can cause them to try to tell the", "design team how to design the product. We mentioned earlier that\nwireframes, mock-ups, and prototypes are great because they\u2019re so much\nmore immediately comprehensible than the PRD. The flip side is that\nbecause design is so visible, it\u2019s easy to have an uninformed opinion. Trust\nyour design team to make smart decisions, and use criteria like Rams\u2019s\ndesign principles to assess if they\u2019re good decisions and to give informed\nopinions.\nSo how do you build a constructive relationship with the design team? A\nsimple but important step is to get to know the team. Building individual\nrelationships with the people you work with will help you respect each other\nas people and deal with conflict more productively.\nBeyond that, in no particular order, there\u2019s a variety of things you can do to\nhave a great relationship with your design team. We recommend that you\nlearn a bit about design, if you don\u2019t know about it already. You don\u2019t need to\nbe an expert, but you should be able to talk about why you think a product is\nwell-designed or not. For software, learn common design patterns and\naccepted layouts for functions like search, settings, and more, especially for\ndifferent platforms. This will help you learn not to force an Android app to\nlook just like an iOS app or  vice versa, for example.\nAs you learn about design, focus on developing an appreciation for what\ngoes into design so that when you see a wireframe, you can ask good\nquestions about why the designers made certain choices and understand the\nimplication of those choices rather than arbitrarily telling them to do certain\nthings. Words like \u201cwhite space\u201d and \u201chierarchy\u201d should eventually be part\nof your vocabulary.\nSimilarly, don\u2019t overstep your bounds. In the PRD, do not specify the\ndesign. Your job is to give requirements and constraints along with how", "you\u2019ll consider the problem solved, and let Design and Engineering find the\nsolution. For example, rather than incorporating mock-ups of a new\nonboarding process, specify what data is required and what\u2019s optional for a\nuser to enter, then let design create a wireframe showing how to enter that\ndata. Even if you used to be an amazing designer, your primary job as a PM\nis to focus on giving clear personas, requirements, and goals.\nYour design team will love you if you\u2019re clear on those three elements. This\nclarity will be part of a well-written PRD and true at the highest level\u2014the\noverall project objective\u2014and with individual user stories. Rather than just\nsaying, \u201cWe need to improve the onboarding process,\u201d explicitly say who the\ntarget customers are, what you need the onboarding process to achieve, and\nhow you measure its success.\nFurthermore, never, ever vaguely say a product is for \u201ceveryone.\u201d There is\nno such persona, and no product is perfect for every single person. Instead,\nmake sure your target market is a clear part of the requirements in the PRD\nand that a persona is defined so that design can make the right choices to\naddress that persona\u2019s needs.\nOnce in a while, you\u2019ll find that you really, really want to sketch out a UX,\nas it\u2019ll be the fastest way to share your thoughts, be it in early conversations\nabout the product or even in a PRD. When you first join a new team, you\u2019ll\nneed to work with other stakeholders and earn their respect. We recommend\nputting together a whiteboarding session with the design lead (and maybe the\nengineering lead) to discuss initial, rough ideas. Together, you can draw on a\nwhiteboard and then take photos of the board to incorporate into your PRD or\nshare with others.\nAfter you\u2019ve worked with a team, you\u2019ll usually find it\u2019s OK to sketch out a\nUX concept on your own rather than only including photos of whiteboards,", "but you need to recognize and make clear to others that this sketch is just to\nconvey what you mean, not to imply design answers. The best way to do this\nis via a napk in sketch. A napkin sketch is a drawing that\u2019s low quality and\ncreated quickly, as if you drew on the back of a napkin with a pen. We\nrecommend using a tool like FiftyThree\u2019s Paper for the iPad instead of a\nprototyping tool like InVision or Balsamiq for any UX sketches you create.\nThis will make sure your sketch is clearly hand-drawn and force you to\ncreate something unpolished but give you a digital drawing with a nice stroke\nquality.\nAs the design team starts to ideate using your PRD, work with them and\nother stakeholders to discuss the pros and cons of each idea beyond just if\nit\u2019s a good design or not, especially thinking about the ideal user vs.\ncustomer. Furthermore, ask if the team\u2019s thought through all the implications\nof the design. If you\u2019re designing a social network and the design team has a\nflag button in the design to mark inappropriate content, what happens when a\ncustomer presses that button? Does that button mean someone on the support\nteam will manually have to look at the content and possibly remove it? Does\nthat team have resources to do s o?\nAll of this advice rolls up into one key point: your job is to provide clear\ncommunication between all stakeholders while keeping the end goal\u2014\nmaking the customer awesome\u2014in everyone\u2019s mind. You are not here to do\nthe stakeholder\u2019s work\u2014you left Design/Engineering/Support/etc. behind to\nmove into product management. You need to keep everyone moving towards\nyour goal.\nThere\u2019s a great story about when President Kennedy visited NASA in 1962.\nThe president asked a janitor what he was doing, and the janitor replied,\n\u201cWell, Mr. President, I\u2019m helping put a man on the moon.\u201d NASA did a great", "job making sure everyone knew what they were working towards, and that\nhelped every individual think about how his actions affected that goal. You\nmight feel like a broken record sometimes, but if you focus on keeping your\nproduct\u2019s goal front and center in everyone\u2019s mind, you\u2019ll be amazed at how\nthe whole team rises to deliver on that goal.\nGOOGLE DESIGN SPRINTS\nGoogle Ventures came up with a great way to use design thinking to solve\ncritical business questions. It has used this process with its portfolio\ncompanies to solve problems ranging from \u201cIs our new business viable?\u201d to\n\u201cHow do we develop this new feature for existing products with millions of\nusers?\u201d\nWe like design sprints because they\u2019re collaborative (involving key\nstakeholders from each department), focused, effective, and user-centered\nways to solve big problems. Furthermore, as we\u2019ve just spent a long time\nexplaining, PMs often have to be hands-off with the actual design work, but\nin a design sprint you get to be hands-on. This can be fun, letting you use your\ncreativity, and it will help you gain an appreciation for what your design\nteam does day to day.\nThese sprints typically last a week. You start the week with a specific\nchallenge to solve, and you end the week with a design the team\u2019s agreed\nupon and that you\u2019ve validated with real customers. Of course, once in a\nwhile you end up invalidating the design and/or raising new questions, but\nthen you can run another sprint using what you learned. Let\u2019s dive into how to\nrun a design sprint!\nSprint Preparation", "Start by picking a sprint master. This person will set the context for the\ndesign sprint and facilitate each stage of the sprint. This will usually be\nsomeone who is familiar with UX research and interaction design, but this\nperson should also be able to lead a meeting productively and get every\nparticipant contributing. The sprint master will do a fair bit of planning\naround content and logistics before the sprint to make sure it runs smoothly.\nGoogle recommends about one day of preparation for each day of the sprint.\nFor content planning, the sprint master will write a design brief that clearly\ndefines the challenge (the PRD can be a great reference here), the\ndeliverable, and the timeline to launch. She might also do a design audit\nbeforehand, pulling together the current designs, user research, and more, to\nprovide context to the sprint team. This is especially critical if the team has\nalready done work on this problem, as there will be existing learning you can\nbuild from.\nFor the sprint logistics, she\u2019ll start by determining the right team to have on\nthe sprint. The best teams are five to eight people and include the PM,\ndesigners, engineers, and other experts or stakeholders. Sometimes,\nespecially in start-ups, the CEO will be part of the sprint team. It\u2019s also\npossible to have multiple teams working in parallel on the same challenge.\nThe sprint master will even schedule the room and make sure she has all the\nneeded supplies, including paper, tape, sticky notes, voting stickers, a timer,\nand pens.\nUnderstand\nThe first part of the sprint is devoted to understanding the problem you\u2019re\ntrying to solve, why you\u2019re trying to solve it, who the customers are, those\ncustomers\u2019 needs and capabilities, and more. As we discussed in Chapter 2,", "understanding the overall context for your customers and company/product is\nalways the first step towards creating new solutions.\nThe sprint master might arrange short talks, user interviews, field visits to\ncustomers, competitive overviews, or beyond to facilitate this step. If you\u2019ve\ndone previous research or work with this sprint challenge, this step is when\nyou\u2019ll present that previous work.\nYou as the product manager will likely play a key role here in helping the\nrest of the team understand your goals and strategy.\nDuring the first day of the sprint, you\u2019ll also schedule your customer-testing\ninterviews for the last day. This will put pressure on your team, forcing you\nto create something to show customers, given real people are coming to see\nyour work. After all, the best creativity happens when you have constraints!\nDefine\nAfter the team understands the problem space, come up with a clear problem\ndefinition. This is when you narrow the problem and come up with the key\nprinciples and goals to help you measure your solution. You might define\nyour design objectives, such as building a \u201cfun to use\u201d product, or you might\nthink about the messaging and tag line for your solution, like \u201ca thousand\nsongs in your pocket.\u201d\nDiverge\nAfter you clearly know the problem and what you want your solution to\nachieve, you and the sprint team will brainstorm as many ideas as possible\nfor how to solve the sprint challenge. You might have everyone work\nindividually to generate ideas using \u201cCrazy Eights,\u201d where you fold a piece\nof paper in half three times, to create a page with eight segments, and take", "five minutes to draw eight ideas, one per segment.\nOr perhaps you\u2019ll work together to brainstorm ideas. Make sure not to\nreject anyone\u2019s ideas during this phase\u2014your goal is to generate as many\nideas as possible, even bad ones. In fact, sometimes working together to\ncome up with the worst possible solution can help you think of new ideas for\nthe best solution.\nYou don\u2019t need to be able to draw well to participate in the Diverge phase.\nBut you should make sure anything you draw or create is understandable on\nits own, without an explanation from the creator. It\u2019s OK to put some text on\nyour drawings or to use multiple drawings to show a flow. Give the concepts\ntitles to help you refer to them. However, don\u2019t put the creator\u2019s name on\neach. You don\u2019t want any company politics to influence which ideas you\npick.\nGet crazy, get creative, and don \u2019t filter yourself. Ideate, ideate, ideate.\nDecide\nOnce you\u2019ve come up with a lot of ideas, you\u2019ll pick the best ones, so far, by\nvoting.\nFor the first round of voting, everyone gets an unlimited number of voting\nstickers, and you vote on what ideas, or pieces of ideas, you like the best.\nYou can use lots of stickers if you love something.\nEven though each idea should be self-explanatory, spend some time\ndiscussing each one. For example, take three minutes to look at each idea,\nand discuss what you like about it, what you don\u2019t like, what could go wrong,\nand more. Don\u2019t let the creator explain the idea first, as it should stand on its\nown, but if the others miss an aspect of the idea, the creator can point it out.\nDon\u2019t worry about achieving consensus during this first round\u2014talk about", "what you like with the various ideas.\nAfter you\u2019ve discussed each idea, you\u2019ll super-vote. This is the decision-\nmaking vote. Each team member will get a limited number of voting stickers,\nand the CEO and PM will get extra voting stickers. Again put these stickers\nnext to what you believe is the best idea, or part of an idea. This voting\nprocess will help you uncover the best ideas, regardless of who created\nthem.\nPrototype\nAfter picking a key idea or two, create a prototype. Building this prototype\nwill take the most time of all the steps, but you will emerge with a mock-up,\ndemo, ph ysical prototype, or other way of demonstrating the idea that you can\nshow to real people.\nYou might end up having multiple prototypes to test the overall utility of the\nsolution separate from the usability or to test the usability of different ideas.\nThe key in this step is to make some artifact that will help you validate your\nsolution. After all, you\u2019ll be showing it to customers shortly!\nUser Testing\nThe final step in the sprint is showing your prototype to real customers and\ngetting feedback. Try to find out what they like and dislike, if the solution\nwill meet their needs, and if there are hidden factors that could stop them\nfrom using this solution.\nYou can also ask for feedback to measure how well you achieved the goals\nyou set forth in the Define step. For example, ask each user to rate how much\nfun they had using your product and what made it less fun.\nMake sure to validate this solution with the key stakeholders, including the", "engineering team, too, to confirm that this is the solution everyone is onboard\nwith pursuing and believes can be implemented.\nWhen user testing is finished and the sprint is over, take some time to\nreview the process and analyze how it went. Did these customers like the\nsolution, or did the design not work? Do you need to do another sprint?\nIdeally, you\u2019ll have a basic design that you know has promise, which you can\ntake, flesh out, and turn into a real product.\nIf you like this approach and want to run your own sprints, we highly\nrecommend reading Google Ventures\u2019s book  Sprint: How to Solve Big\nProblems and Test New Ideas in Just Five Days. This book  contains lots of\ntips from Google Ventures\u2019s experience running sprints, to help you run the\nbest sprint possible.\nAt this point, you should have an appreciation for what design involves and\nsee that it\u2019s more than just making things look pretty. You should also have an\nidea about how to work collaboratively with the design team. Remember, we\nsay that design is done when our prototypes and mock-ups are validated as a\nsolution to the problem we\u2019re trying to solve and Engineering has agreed to\nthe designs\u2019 viability. Now that we\u2019ve drawn up the blueprints for our\nproduct, let\u2019s turn our attention to how we\u2019ll work with Engineering to get\nour product built.\n________ \nCHAPTER SIX TIP", "Conrad Albrecht-Buehler, an amazing designer who\u2019s also worked as a\nproduc t manage r, provides us with this chapter\u2019s tip. Conrad has designed\nan award-winning in-car interface for BMW, designed some of the first\nmobile applications for VMware, and worked on several produc ts at Apple.\nIn addition to being a designer, he has worked as a software engineer, a\nproduc t manage r, and a user researcher. He lives in Munich and the Bay\nArea with his wife, two kids, and a Shi ba Inu.\nBEING OPEN AND FLEXIBLE\nAaron Sorkin, who\u2019s written some of my favorite television and films, recently said that for many\nepisodes of The West Wing, he would start with just an idea for a moment, and then let the story build as\nhe wrote it. To paraphrase: he didn\u2019t always know exactly what he was writing until he wrote it. In\ninterviews, many of my favorite authors and, yes, even designers, have said the same thing. It\u2019s not\nbecause they lacked discipline or were not methodical in their work, but stories and products are\ncomplex, and, until you get deep into creating either one, much of that complexity isn\u2019t\nrevealed. Because of that, as a PM working with a designer\u2014be it a user-experience designer, user\nresearcher, or industrial or visual designer\u2014my advice is this: be open and be flexible.\nAs a designer works to accommodate requirements from product and from engineering (and myriad\nother sources described in previous chapters), compromises must be made on one aspect or another. Be\nflexible, rather than authoritarian. Don\u2019t try to push a singular agenda an call it a \u201cvision.\u201d Be open to\ncompromise as the deeper complexities of the product reveal themselves. The best designers learn how\nto make the best compromises. But not without your help and the help of all stakeholders and\ncontributors. However, as the PM, you may have to referee the debate around these compromises, and\nthat\u2019s always tough because you will never be a neutral observer in those debates.\nThe various sides of the debate will be framed in terms of cost vs. benefit. Most stakeholders will see\nthe costs in terms of financial costs or time costs\u2014things that impact the company and employees. The\ndesigners will see the costs in terms of impact to the user. That is where things go off the rails most\nfrequently. Another stakeholder will claim, \u201cI\u2019m a user, and I\u2019d be fine with this.\u201d Maybe the customer\nwill be, as well, but it is the responsibility of the designer to know how people who are not just like the\ndesigner will perceive and interpret the product. Even if all the debate participants claim that they, as", "users, would also be fine with a compromise, don\u2019t treat that as a majority of a sample size and imagine\nthat the designer arguing for something else is obviously mistaken. Be open to their experience, and\nvalue the time they\u2019ve spent trying to get into the heads of people different from themselves to help you\npredict how a customer will see, use, and value your product. It may help you make the best, if not\nalways the most expedient, compromise as you address the complexities of a product.", "Now that you\u2019ve figured out your product\u2019s requirements and come up with\n\u2014and hopefully tested\u2014a  design, it\u2019s time to actually build your product! In\npractice, this phase of the product-development life cycle is where you will\nspend the bulk of your time as a product manager. You\u2019ll work closely with\nEngineering day to day to help oversee the product that\u2019s being built, making\nsure it meets the product requirements, making scope changes if key features\nare taking longer than expect to develop, prioritizing the backlog, and\neliminating whatever obstacles you can for the engineering team.\nYou\u2019ll want to do your best to establish a strong relationship with the\nengineering team because although a great relationship doesn\u2019t guarantee", "success, a bad relationship guarantees failure.\nWhile this phase can be a lot of fun as the product comes to life, it can be\nvery hard for product managers for two reasons. The first is that if you\nstarted your career as an engineer, you might unintentionally frustrate the\nengineering team or imply you know better than they do. Alternatively, if you\ndon\u2019t have an engineering background, you might not understand how\nengineers work\u2014or how to work with them\u2014causing them to not respect\nyou. Fortunately, these problems are avoidable! Let\u2019s start by looking at soft\nskills, interpersonal relationship skills that will help you work with\nengineering. Then we\u2019ll look at common ways engineering teams work and\nsee how you as the PM fit into those workflows.\nPRODUCT/ENGINEERING RELATIONSHIPS\nJust as design is more than just creating pixels, engineering is more than just\ntyping code. Programming is very much like an art form: you\u2019re building\nsomething from nothing, and all of the pieces must function pretty much\nperfectly or the whole product won\u2019t work. This artistic complexity leads to\nsome common traits in engineers worth knowing about, as understanding\nthese traits will help your interpersonal communication and relationship with\nengineers.\nIn general, engineers are highly intelligent people motivated by working on\nhard problems and learning something new. They\u2019re often very independent\nand care more about crafting an elegant solution to a complex problem than\nabout specific business needs. Engineering is hard, and every product needs\nengineers. Given that, their skills are incredibly in demand and talented\nengineers are worth their weight in gold!\nHowever, because their skills are in demand, if engineers feel like they\u2019re", "not being respected or mentally challenged, or if they don\u2019t believe in the\noverall product and direction, they\u2019ll likely look for a new oppor tunity.\nReplacing an engineer is very costly, both in terms of actual cost and\nproductivity costs. PMs can help engineers, and the whole company, by\nmaking sure engineers feel respected and recognized and have confidence in\nthe product.\nSo how do you keep a great relationship with Engineering? You\u2019re starting\noff the right way by recognizing that it takes work! The biggest thing you\nshould keep in mind is that coding is hard and you should trust that your\nengineers know their craft\u2014contrary to what some designers and PMs think,\nengineers are not just code monkeys typing on keyboards. Especially if you\nhave an engineering background, one of the worst things to say to an engineer\nis \u201ccan\u2019t you just\u2026.\u201d Those three words imply that whatever the engineer is\ndoing is easy and that you know better.\nWe recommend that you view working with Engineering as an educational\nexperience, both for you and for them. For example, ask them to help estimate\nhow hard a task might be. And if the estimate is higher than expected, ask if\nthey could explain what goes into that estimate and where the tricky parts are.\nThis will help you understand the full scope of the task, and if the engineer is\nmaking assumptions because you hadn\u2019t accounted for something, perhaps\nyou can decide to limit the scope of the task and make the engineer\u2019s life\neasier. As a simple example, if you\u2019re building a streaming-video player, it\ntakes a lot more work to make a 4K video stream efficiently than a normal\nHD one. If it makes sense, you could make a product choice to not support\nstreaming 4K content, thereby reducing Engineering\u2019s workload.\nAnother big mistake that PMs make with Engineering is that they don\u2019t take\ntime to get to know the engineers and how to best work with each person.", "Some engineers work best when they have a to-do list, and they don\u2019t care\nabout the broader picture or why you\u2019re making certain choices. But other\nengineers get frustrated when you don\u2019t clearly explain why you made certain\nchoices. To those engineers, this makes you come across as dictating, not\ncollaborating. A well-written product requirements document (PRD) like we\ndescribed in Chapter 5 can help both of these situations, as it makes the\ninformation available for the engineers should they choose to read it.\nAs you continue throughout the development cycle and have to make hard\ndecisions, cut features, etc., make sure to work with the engineering lead and\nperhaps individual engineers to understand the technical side of these\ndecisions. They\u2019re the only people who can tell you how technically feasible\nsomething is and provide an estimate for how difficult it will be to build.\nThis doesn\u2019t always mean Engineering just has bad news for PMs.\nSometimes they\u2019ll even tell you that something you thought impossible is\nactually feasible! Do make sure to write down key decisions, such as in the\nPRD or in key user stories\u2014or in epic requirements if you\u2019re using scrum\u2014\nso that there\u2019s no confusion about what the state of that decision is.\nFurthermore, change and tradeoffs happen in every product. Projects often\nget behind schedule because many small things pile up, such as someone\nbeing out sick for a while, family emergencies, jury duty, and more. If you\nwork closely with Engineering to watch the balance between time (When are\nwe aiming to have this done/shipped?), quality (Can we take on some\ntechnical debt now?), and money (Would more people or overtime help us\nget this project done?), you\u2019ll keep the process collaborative and deliver the\nhighest-possible-quality product on the best-possible schedule.\nWorking on projects that have a lot of technical debt can also be very\nfrustrating for engineers, as accumulated debt can make even polish and bug", "fixes painful. We\u2019ve talked before about how it\u2019s important to the project\u2019s\noverall momentum to periodically pay off any technical debt. It\u2019s also\nimportant to your engineers\u2019 sanity and your relationship with them to\nperiodically do s o.\nA lot going on in an office inherently conspires against engineers.\nSpecifically, solving hard problems requires deep concentration.\nInterruptions, whether for meetings or to reply to high-priority messages via\nemail, Slack, HipChat, etc., can be very frustrating and tough to recover from\nmentally. Open office plans make things even worse, as there are so many\ndistractions and so much noise that developers often wear large, noise-\ncancelling headphones so that they can focus on their work.\nWhile some of this is beyond your control, like floor plans, there are some\nthings you can control, especially around communication. Do what you can to\ngive the engineering team time to focus on getting its work done, even if it\nmeans you have to wait for an answer to a question. Not every question you\nhave is urgent, and interrupting someone\u2019s coding flow for a non-critical\nquestion is never appreciated.\nAs Engineering completes each task, make sure to provide feedback,\nwhether it\u2019s that they did a great job and exceeded your expectations or that\nyou found a bug or something isn\u2019t quite right. And when the project\u2019s over,\nmake sure the engineers\u2014and everyone else involved\u2014g et their share of the\ncredit for getting the project done. Don\u2019t hog the credit\u2014be  humble!\nTo be clear, the engineering team is not the PM\u2019s boss\u2014you don\u2019t need the\nengineers\u2019 approval on everything, and they\u2019re not the most important people\nin the company. But they\u2019re the ones building the product and the ones you\u2019ll\nspend a lot of your time with. If you put in the extra effort to do your best for\nthem and to help them feel like part of the overall project team and not just", "code monkeys, they\u2019ll feel happier and more respected, and the work they do\nwill be higher quality.\nFinally, no two engineering teams are the same. While you should keep our\nadvice in mind on the whole, sometimes with junior teams you need to step in\na little more and make sure they\u2019re following best practices. For example,\nyou might need to explicitly encourage them to add more automated test\ncoverage and to take time to do t horough code reviews.\nSOFTWARE-DEVELOPMENT METHODOLOGIES\nA development methodology is simply the framework you use to structure the\nwork to build the product. These methodologies are really more about\nproject management, not just how developers write code. We\u2019ve touched on\ntwo of these methodologies\u2014waterfall and lean/agile\u2014 previously, but they\nhave such a profound impact on how your engineering team works, we\u2019ll\ncover them in detail here. We\u2019re going to focus on various software-\ndevelopment methodologies, but many of the same principles apply to\nhardware development.\nAt one end of the spectrum, you have workflows where you, the PM, create\na detailed spec and the engineering team disappears for months\u2014likely more\nthan you anticipated\u2014reemerging with the product built exactly as specified.\nAt the other end, the engineering team divides the project into the smallest\ntasks possible, programmers work in pairs on the same computer to complete\none task, and then they come back to see what task they should do next. The\nnext-up tasks might change while the programmers are working on their\ncurrent task, and it doesn\u2019t matter to the programmers. Let\u2019s compare the two\nmost common approaches along this spectrum, waterfall and agile.", "Waterfall Development\nThe waterfall method is the oldest style of software development. Early\nsoftware engineers simply adopted stages from the hardware world\n(manufacturing), and over time this approach became more refined. In 1985,\nthe US Department of Defense formalized the waterfall process in its DOD-\nSTD-2167A  document, which specified that its contractors would use this\napproach to write software along with detailed descriptions of how they\u2019d\nuse it and the deliverables they\u2019d create.\nAs you might guess, the waterfall method is very structured, with explicit,\nformal stages. It\u2019s even called \u201cwaterfall\u201d because you can\u2019t move to the next\nstage until the current stage is done\u2014everything goes from one stage to the\nnext in a big dump, like water over a waterfall. Waterfall development starts\nwith the requirements phase, where the PM has the most to do, finding the\nright opportunity and writing a very detailed PRD. Unlike the PRDs we\ndiscussed in Chapter 5, waterfall PRDs need to be detailed and complete,\nspecifying as much of the project up front as possible. They are not living\ndocuments, but rather large and detailed bibles for the product.\nAfter the requirements phase, Engineering and Design take over, beginning\nwith a design phase, a coding phase, and a testing and integration phase.\nProducts often ship with known bugs, as they\u2019d never release if you fixed\nevery bug. PMs are often involved in prioritizing bugs to make sure the ones\nthat will affect customers the most are fixed before release.\nWaterfall has a few benefits. For one, everyone will have a great idea of\nwhat the final product will look like early on since you create a detailed\nspec. Furthermore, since you do a lot of work up front creating the\nrequirements, you might find and fix an issue in that phase. It\u2019s significantly\ncheaper to fix a problem early on. Because the scope is fixed early on,", "Engineering can make close-to-optimal design decisions for the project\nrather than designing for potential unknowns. Third-party development firms\noften like working with waterfall with clients because they can budget a\nproject based upon the work they\u2019ve agreed to do. Clients (and PMs) often\nlike it because they don\u2019t need to be involved day to day in managing the\nproject. Management also often likes the clear and easily understandable\nmilestones in a project, and you can measure progress by what percentage of\nthe spec is implemented.\nBut there are also significant drawbacks to waterfall that have caused many\nsoftware teams to move away from it. These problems include the following:\nCustomers might not know their exact requirements up front. Because\nwaterfall focuses on specifying and building something complete rather than\non fast iterations, what you build initially might not meet the customers\u2019\nneeds. And by the time you have a new version addressing their needs, you\nmight find that the customers have long since stoppe d using your product\nand sought out another answer.\nThere\u2019s no good  way to handle changes. After the requirements stage, you\nmight find new data that affects the product, and waterfall doesn\u2019t let you go\nback upstream to change decisions in earlier stages.\nThere is no time-boxing on each step, and the release often slips. One of\nthe most common problems is that there were technological unknowns and\ncoding the solution took much longer than intended, so a three-month project\nestimate actually took six months to complete. You had to invest those extra\nthree months because otherwise you wouldn\u2019t have a product.", "It can take so long to move through stages that a good  decision you\nmade initially might be the wrong decision when you release the\nproduct. For example, maybe you thought customers wanted a certain\nproduct, but after building it you discovered the market conditions changed\nand they no longer wanted it.\nIf you\u2019re working on a product where the requirements and technology are\nwell known, waterfall is a reasonable approach. If your company is using a\nwaterfall system, the best thing you can do as a PM is validate the PRD as\nmuch as possible initially to prevent changes later, and try to learn quickly if\nthe market likes your idea.\nIn most cases, waterfall\u2019s shortcomings outweigh its benefits. Many\nsoftware teams\u2014including that of the Department of Defense\u2014have\nswitched to more iterative development approaches. There are numerous\nones with various names, and some are still very waterfall-ish, but\neventually you will encounter the second main development methodology,\nagile development.\nAgile Development\nAgile development is fundamentally about being flexible, iterating quickly,\nand embracing changes. Unfortunately, \u201cagile\u201d has become a somewhat\ngeneric and vague term much like \u201cbig data.\u201d Many companies claim to\nfollow agile practices or use words from agile methodologies to describe\ntheir process, when in fact their workflows aren\u2019t at all agile. Let\u2019s look at\nwhat agile really means and then at specific implementations.\nThe Manifesto for Agile Software Development defines key principles of\nagile, including these:", "Individuals and i nteractions over processes and tools\nWorking software over comprehensive documentation\nCustomer collabor ation over contract negotiation\nRespondi ng to change  over following a plan\nInstead of a fully fleshed out, staged approach, agile follows an incremental\napproach. With agile you plan out a relatively small unit of work, build what\nyou need to, and evaluate what you built. Then you use that knowledge to\nplan the next work to do. These small units of work can be organized either\naround time, in which case they\u2019re called a sprint, or around the number of\ntasks a team can work on at once, called a cycle.\nThere are multiple agile development methodology implementations you\ncan use as starting point for your team\u2019s agile workflow, and you can adapt\nan approach for your team\u2019s dynamic. What matters is that you\u2019re open to\nchange, iterating quickly, and building working software, not focused on how\nyou get there.\nFor agile to be truly effective, you need to embrace the lean principles\nwe\u2019ve advoc ated throughout this book , like building a minimum viable\nproduct (MVP) rather than the fully featured product. In other words, build\nsomething small as quickly as possible, learn from it, and then iterate in the\nnext sprint/cycle.\nShort sprints\u2014one or two weeks\u2014or continuous deployment are ideal with\nagile, as they let you move quickly and get feedback. If you were to try to\nexecute an agile process with a six-month sprint, you\u2019d encounter many of the\ndisadvantages we listed for waterfall, like how the customer\u2019s needs might\nchange while you\u2019re building the product and you have no mechanism to get\nfeedback or make changes during a sprint.", "Agile and lean also lead to a breadth-first approach where each sprint or\ncycle will\u2014ideally\u2014produce a usable piece of software that you can use to\nget feedback from customers or clients. In waterfall you\u2019re much more likely\nto schedule milestones so that part of the product is deemed feature-complete\nbefore moving on to another part, scheduling for depth. With agile,\nsprints/cycles are usually focused on getting to a very minimal but functional\napp initially and then adding features to each section as needed, scheduling\nfor breadth.\nFurthermore, the team will do incremental testing on the code during each\nsprint/cycle, which leads to a higher-quality product with fewer bugs.\nStudies have shown it\u2019s up to 20 times cheaper to find and fix bugs as you\nbuild a product rather than doing separate development and testing stages\nlike in waterfall.\nUnfortunately, there are some downsides to agile, especially for PMs. Agile\nworkflows frequently put a lot more demands on you, sometimes even having\nyou handle quality assurance/bug testing in addition to everything else you\u2019re\ndoing.\nHaving more milestones more often also puts additional demands on you to\nkeep validating builds with customers, but you\u2019ll need to work to find the\nright balance of wanting feedback and deciding which builds to validate.\nMaking sure a customer wants something before spending tons of time\nbuilding it really is a big net win. After all, if you find you\u2019re building the\nwrong thing, you can pivot before spending more time on it. But it would take\nall of your time and not always yield useful information if you tried to\nvalidate every build.\nSimilarly, in an agency model clients sometimes dislike agile because they\nhave to be more involved in the project, consistently scheduling and", "prioritizing.\nOne of the biggest criticisms of agile, however, comes from developers. If\nyou\u2019re building something new/trying to solve a hard problem, agile\u2019s heavy\nfocus on delivering something usable within a sprint (and the various\nassociated practices) is counter to thinking deeply and solving a problem.\nOften, developers discover that the best way to find a creative solution to a\nhard problem is to isolate oneself, focus deeply, experiment, and reemerge\nwhen they have a solution. There are ways to avoid this shortcoming, such as\nleveraging scrum spikes\u2014a user story to investigate something\u2014or having\nexplicit R&D sprints where a developer\u2019s only task is to try to solve one\nproblem. Just being aware that this is a frustration for developers will help\nyou make planning decisions that take it into account.\nAgile can also be tricky to scale to large teams. See the \u201cFurther Reading\u201d\nsection for information about Agile Release Trains to help scale. There\u2019s\nalso a ramp-up curve before you hit full productivity when implementing an\nagile workflow.\nAgile critics say that it leads to reactionary development, as you\u2019re\nresponding to what customers want now, rather than planning out a roadmap\nand maintaining a product vision. We feel it\u2019s quite possible to have an\noverall thematic roadmap with projects defined and communicated by PRDs,\nbuilt using agile/lean methodologies, where the exact details change as you\nfind out how customers use your product.\nDespite the various criticisms, the Standish Group, an IT advisory center,\ntracked 50,000 projects from 2011 through 2015 and found that the success\nrate (shipping a working product) of agile products was 39% vs. 11% with\nwaterfall. That\u2019s a huge difference, but note that even with agile 61% of\nprojects don\u2019t have a working product by the end.", "Let\u2019s look at two of the most popu lar ways agile methodology is\nimplemented: scrum and Kanban.\nScrum\nScrum development is based on an idea from rugby, specifically that a team\u2019s\nfunctioning as a team, and not as a group of individuals, is key to success,\nand the best teams are given direction but can devise their own tactics for\nhow to achieve their goals. Scrum came about in the early \u201990s whereas agile\nwas formalized in the early \u201900s, but scrum\u2019s architects were part of the\ngroup that created the Agile Alliance.\nAt a high level, with software development, using scrum means that the\nteam comes together to prioritize what to do next and set short-term goals for\nwhat work to finish. You as the PM will have very strong input into that part\nof the process. Then the team goes off and figures out how to best do that\nwork. You\u2019ll check in with the team members at the start of each day as they\nwork, addressing any questions, and you\u2019ll validate the work when they say\nit\u2019s ready. But you don\u2019t micro-manage them or change their goals before\nthey\u2019re done with the current set.\nScrum is one of the most common approaches to agile because it has a very\nclearly defined project structure with clear team roles. This makes it easy for\na company transitioning from waterfall to agile to adopt scrum. And even if\ncompanies don\u2019t fully implement scrum, they often borrow ideas from it, such\nas daily stand-up/check-in meetings.\nScrum uses time-boxed sprints, most commonly one or two weeks. Each\nweek, you meet with the engineering team to perform backlog grooming. A\nproduct\u2019s backlog is the collection of all the bugs and suggestions, generally\nwritten as user stories, for the product.", "Grooming simply means you make sure the bugs and sugs are organized and\nhave enough clarity to act on. For example, we\u2019ve all seen\u2014and maybe sent\n\u2014poor ly written software bugs that just say \u201cit crashed.\u201d That\u2019s not helpful.\nIn grooming, you\u2019d do what you could to add steps to reproduce the crash\nand attach a crash log to the issue so that the team could eventually fix the\nbug. In addition to adding clarity, during grooming you will make sure each\nnew item for the backlog has acceptance criteria: How do you know the item\nis done properly?. Furthermore, we like writing backlog tasks as user stories\nbecause that format helps explain why something is an issue so that Design\nand Engineering can determine the best approach to address the issue.\nAlso during the grooming meeting, the engineering team will assess the\ncomplexity of the new or updated stories, breaking them down into sub-tasks\nif necessary. It\u2019s tough to know exactly how hard a task is or how many hours\nit will take, so you\u2019ll often see complexity measured using relatively\nweighted story points. Teams might assign one point to an easy task, two\npoints to a medium task, four points to a hard task, and eight points to a very\nhard task. The idea is that you don\u2019t know exactly how hard something is, but\nyou can say that one thing should be twice as hard as another.\nAfter assessing the complexity, your role as the product owner will be to\nprovide rough prioritization for any new items along with existing backlog\nitems based on customer need, business value, and longer-term goals/needs.\nYour goal with this prioritization is to have the most important thing to work\non next at the top of  the backlog.\nBacklogs often grow quite large, and there\u2019s usually a big chunk of stuff on\nit that you\u2019re just not going to be able to get to, along with things that are cool\nbut not relevant in the immediate future. Teams often create a second list,\ncalled an icebox, for these less-immediately-relevant-but-things-you-don\u2019t-", "want-to-forget stories. Stories in the icebox can be \u201cunfrozen\u201d and moved to\nthe backlog, but you won\u2019t actively work on icebox items. As we discussed\nin previous chapters, there will be a lot of potential features and ideas to\nmake the product better. You will be saying \u201cno\u201d a lot to make sure the\nproject doesn\u2019t get out of hand! Putting something in the icebox instead of\nexplicitly saying \u201cno\u201d is a nice way to make people feel their input is valued\nwhile avoiding feature creep.\nLater, you\u2019ll have another planning meeting where you determine the sprint\nbacklog. The sprint backlog is simply the list of user stories the team intends\nto complete during the sprint. You\u2019ll pick the key things you want to work on\nbased on priority/business value, and the engineering team will agree on\nwhether they can commit to it during the sprint.\nA common question is, how do you know how many backlog items to pick\nfor a sprint? Over time, you\u2019ll find that the team tends to complete n story\npoints per sprint. That number is called the sprint velocity. During this\nplanning meeting, if you add up the story points on the tasks everyone agrees\nto do, i t should come out to that velocity.\nIf you\u2019re struggling with how to prioritize what to do, try calculating a\npriority score by adding a Business Value field to each story, like we\nsuggested in Moving Forward section at the end of Chapter 4. Factors that go\ninto the business value can include how much you believe this will help you\nachieve a goal, how many customers are asking for this, if there\u2019s an\nimportant technical reason you need to do this, and so on. Then, calculate a\npriority score by dividing the business value by the complexity. High-value,\nlow-complexity stories will have a high score. High-value, high-complexity\nstories will have a mid-range score. Low-value, high-complexity stories will\nhave a low score. This approach is especially useful if your team is", "responsible for multiple products and you have to balance each product\u2019s\nneeds during sprint planning.\nNote that you won\u2019t change the sprint backlog during the sprint, as that\ndisrupts the team and can throw off the sprint velocity, which affects\nplanning. This lack of change encourages you to have shorter sprints,\nespecially when priorities are shifting, so that you can balance reacting to\nchange with letting the team function effectively.\nYou\u2019ll also find that scrum requires more attention to the balance between\nbuilding the right thing (what PMs want), building the thing right (what\nengineers want), and building it fast (what scrum masters want so they can\nget feedback quickly). It\u2019s quite likely that you will accumulate technical debt\n\u2014that is, the code will have some funkiness in it that Engineering had to\nbuild to deliver something in time.\nIt\u2019s OK to have a little technical debt to get short-term customer value, but\nlots of technical debt can reduce your team\u2019s velocity. During sprints, you\u2019ll\nperiodically need to accept work that pays off that technical debt even though\nthere\u2019s no visible customer value. For example, if we rewrote Moove r from\nObjective-C to Swift, there wouldn\u2019t be any immediate customer value, but it\ncould make it easier to add new features going forward, improving the team\u2019s\nvelocity.\nDuring the sprint, you\u2019ll have short, 15-minute meetings called stand-ups at\nthe start of each workday, where each team member states what she did\nduring the past day, what she aims to accomplish today, and if she has any\nblocking issues.\nAt the end of the sprint, you\u2019ll have a demo meeting with key\nstakeholders/the customer/the client to show what you\u2019ve built and gauge\ntheir feedback, and an internal sprint retrospective to assess how the sprint", "went.\nWhen done well, while combining scrum and lean methodologies, scrum\ntends to provide a very nice balance of planning ahead and tolerating change,\nwhich we\u2019ve found valuable. Since each sprint ideally produces something\nusable, you can break down a bigger plan specified in a PRD into smaller\nmilestones and validate what you\u2019re building at key points with customers\nand stakeholders to make sure you\u2019re on the right path. If you\u2019re not, pivot\nbefore building more.\nWhen you start a new project, scrum is especially helpful. Early on in a\nproject, there\u2019s a lot of risk (business, technical, and more). By focusing on\nsprints and tasks that de-risk the project, you might have low initial customer\nvalue but enable rapid progress later.\nFor example, when planning Moove r\u2019s new customer messaging feature, we\nmight focus on making messaging back and forth between customers and\nmovers work initially, not paying any attention to a good user experience.\nThis will let us test and make sure that this core piece works. If the\ndevelopment team finds out that its initial approach has some big limitation\n(e.g., maybe it\u2019s constantly blocked by a firewall), the team can come up with\na better solution. And if it turns out that the core piece isn\u2019t do-able, you can\nreassess what you\u2019re building without the team\u2019s wasting time on non-core\npieces.\nScrum also makes project management easier, as you can use story points\nand the total story points for outstanding items in the product backlog to\ncreate trend lines. These trend lines let you estimate when the project will be\ndone with a feature set, along with how much work will be done on a certain\ndate.\nIf you have to make a schedule tradeoff, we\u2019d recommend reducing the", "project\u2019s scope rather than extending the schedule. That way you make sure\nyou have something done by the deadline, and if you finish early you can\nincrease the scope.\nUnfortunately, scrum has some problems. Some of these problems have\neven led to cries that \u201cagile is dead.\u201d The heart of that argument is that the\nagile movement was suppos ed to be about individuals and interactions and\nresponding to change. Scrum has become synonymous with agile, yet\nimplementing scrum is often more about process over individuals, and\nchange has been limited to enable better planning. In other words, \u201cagile\u201d has\nbeen bastardized to be just as rigid as waterfall.\nStand-up meetings are a great example of that rigidity. The goal is to keep\nthe team apprised of what\u2019s going on and to help unblock any issues at the\nstart of each day. But if your team starts its day at different times or works in\ndifferent time zones, stand-up meetings aren\u2019t effective because they\u2019ll be at\nthe start of the day for one person but hours into the day for another. Plus,\nthese check-ins all too often become an easy way for managers to micro-\nmanage while claiming it\u2019s part of scrum. Despite these shortcomings, the\nteams still hold their stand-ups because that\u2019s what scrum says to do. A  better\napproach would be to create new ways to communicate, like agile\nencourages, such as posting a status update to Slack at the end of the day\nrather than holding a stand-up.\nScrum can also create headaches for you. It\u2019s often up to the product\nmanager to do acceptance testing, making sure each user story is completed\ncorrectly and without bugs. This can be very demanding of your time, and\nwhen you combine it with everything else you have to do, it\u2019s easy to get\nsloppy  and miss bugs that a dedicated QA team would have caught.\nA final downside to scrum is that while you\u2019re seeing progress more", "frequently than with waterfall, in the best-case scenario you still have to wait\na whole sprint to see the latest and greatest. While that might be fine for a\nnew feature, it can be very frustrating for bug fixes! Given how easy it is to\nrelease software in today\u2019s world, such as with web apps, there are alternate\nagile approaches worth looking at, such as Kanban.\nKanban\nKanban development comes from Toyota, which came up with this\nmethodology by looking at how supermarkets stock shelves. Specifically,\nsupermarkets aim to be \u201cjust in time\u201d so that the shelves are neither empty\nnor overstocked with wasted, expired food. W hile Toyota used this technique\nto build cars efficiently, it is often applied to software, too.\nKanban\u2019s goal is to match the team\u2019s capacity to do work with how much\nwork is actually happening. Additionally, there should be a few tasks ready\nto go so that if a team finished n story points of work, they can immediately\nstart working on a task requiring another n points to complete. This is nice\nbecause your future priorities can change with very little impact on the\nteam\u2019s current work.\nIn Kanban, you will typically create a task board showing what\u2019s up next\n(to-do), in progress, ready to be tested/verified, and done. Tasks will move\nfrom one column to the next, and you\u2019ll know how much work the team can\nhandle at once along with how many things it can verify at once.\nWhile many agile methodologies are time-based, Kanban isn\u2019t. Instead, the\nPM will work with the dev team to reprioritize the backlog and make sure\nthat the most important items are always next up and their difficulty estimates\nare accurate. This leads Kanban teams to focus on cycle time: how long it\ntakes from the moment you start a unit of work until it ships.", "Many little things can hurt cycle time, such as one person having\nspecialized and required knowledge for the task, along with multitasking.\nTherefore, Kanban encourages teams to learn skills outside their domains\u2014\nso that everyone could test, for example, if there\u2019s work piling up in the\n\u201cready to be verified\u201d queue and holding up the next phase\u2014and to stay\nfocused by keeping the amount of work in progress small.\nOne of the biggest benefits to Kanban is that it enables continuous\ndeployment. Once a change moves through the cycle, it\u2019s ready to be\nreleased. Especially for web apps, this is quite nice and enables immediate\ncustomer feedback.\nKanban is also nice because it can be implemented on top of other\nmethodologies. It\u2019s really just a focus on incremental, continuous\nimprovement to the product. In general, if your team is already using a\nworkflow and executing well, Kanban might help the team move to the next\nlevel. But if your team needs help becoming more efficient in general,\nshaking things up by focusing on implementing another agile process, Kanban\nmight not be the right place to start. That\u2019s because Kanban is a much less\nformalized method than scrum, and it can be harder to understand how to\nimplement it initially.\nSometimes you\u2019ll see Kanban combined with scrum\u2014called \u201cscrumban\u201d)\n\u2014which was originally intended as a way to transition from scrum to\nKanban but has become a methodology of its own. Here, the team will have a\nplanning meeting, execute a very short sprint, and then have another planning\nmeeting when the work in progress falls below a certain number of story\npoints. There are no predefined roles or fixed schedules, and the iterations\nare focused on points delivered rather than time.\nHowever, while Kanban is great for development teams, it can be very hard", "on PMs. PMs are frequently quite busy, working with customers, shepherding\nproducts, working with marketing, and more. Kanban requires us to also be\navailable continuously to verify each task is completed (acceptance testing)\nand to make sure the next set of tasks is prioritized and ready to go (backlog\ngrooming). If you don\u2019t continuously do these tasks, you might become the\nbottleneck for the whole team!\nOverall, remember that with agile, individuals and interactions are the most\nimportant element\u2014more important than processes and tools. This means that\nyou shouldn\u2019t worry about following a word-for-word implementation of a\nspecific methodology. Start somewhere and figure out what works best for\nyour team. And don \u2019t be afraid to try a new approach.\nWORKING WITH REMOTE TEAMS\nA common challenge PMs face is how to work with development teams that\naren\u2019t in the same physical space or even the same time zone. While there\u2019s\nno one right answer, clear communication is the key. This doesn\u2019t mean an\nexpectation of non-stop communication and constant availability, but rather\nhaving regular check-ins and using tools like Google Hangouts to see each\nother and remember that you\u2019re working with a person.\nYou can play a big part in helping remote teams be successful by over-\ncommunicating requirements, goals, decisions, and the definition of \u201cdone\u201d\nfor the project so that everyone feels like they\u2019re on the same team and has a\nclear understanding of what they\u2019re working towards, regardless of where\ntheir desks sit. Sometimes important decisions or clarifications happen in a\nhallway conversation, and unless you pay attention, a remote developer might\nnot hear about that decision, or might feel left out of the decision-making\nprocess.", "Creating a culture where people don\u2019t think twice about having a quick\nvideo chat can help replicate the face-to-face interaction that happens\nnaturally in a single location. Too often, we still think of a video conference\nas a formal, scheduled time\u2014it doesn\u2019t have to be that way.\nFurthermore, be aware of when people are starting or ending their days. Is\nthere something that team A can do at the end of its day that you need for the\nstart of your day? Or is there something you can get done by the end of your\nday so that when team B starts, it\u2019s not blocked? It can even be helpful to\nestablish \u201cgolden hour\u201d handoff meetings so that these needs get\ncommunicated clearly at the start and end of each team\u2019s workday.\nAgile helps a lot with remote teams because it forces you to think about the\nadaptable nature of agile to figure out workflows that work well for you. For\nexample, scrum works well with remote teams because you can plan what to\ndo, let people work independently, and still conduct daily stand-ups.\nDepending on what time zones people are in, you might have to conduct daily\nstand-ups asynchronously via email or instant message throughout the day\nrather than having everyone together at the same time. Additionally, at the\nreview meeting, rather than trying to accommodate everyone\u2019s schedule and\npossibly making the meeting inconvenient for the stakeholders, try having the\nproduct owner, rather than individual developers, present the overall team\u2019s\nwork to the stakeholders.\nThe biggest thing that remote teams miss out on is the natural team-building\nthat happens when people spend their days together. It\u2019s important to get your\nteam together in the same place periodically, even if it\u2019s just for team-\nbuilding exercises. Product managers should have empathy for their teams,\nnot just for their customers. Spending time together is a good way to develop\nsolid relationships.", "WORKING WITH THIRD-PARTY DEVELOPMENT\nTEAMS\nIf you\u2019re a software PM, there\u2019s a good chance that at some point you will\nwork on a project with a third-party development team. This means that the\nproject\u2019s developers aren\u2019t company employees, but rather employees of a\ndevelopment agency you\u2019ve hired. Companies usually engage a third-party\ndevelopment team when they\u2019re resource-constrained\u2014a  start-up may not\nhave had time or funds to build a full-time development team, or in an larger\ncompany may want to take on a project its internal team doesn\u2019t have time to\ndo. Sometimes you\u2019ll also hire a third-party team because they have a\nparticular skill that you have a short-term need of, such as expertise in a\nspecific API.\nAs a product manager, you\u2019ll handle a lot of the interaction between your\ncompany and this team, and you can do a few things to ensure success. The\nbiggest is to make sure you\u2019re communicating the requirements, goals, and\ndeadlines to the third-party team clearly. Take the time to address any\npotentially confusing elements as they arise. Writing everything down on a\nshared project-management resource such as Basecamp will help ensure\neveryone has access to the same information and key decisions. Coordinate\nthe timelines and progress with any stakeholders internally to make sure\neverything looks good. It\u2019s often better to over-communicate, especially at\nfirst.\nIt\u2019s also very helpful if you establish frequent milestones with the external\nteam. If that team is internally using an agile process, this should be easy. The\nbenefit is that you can see what they\u2019re building, and if something isn\u2019t\nheading in the right direction\u2014whether because of a miscommunication or\nbecause you made a mistake in what you needed to build\u2014y ou can address it", "early. Just like with an internal development team, if you give a third-party\nteam a large spec and then only check in three months later, what they\u2019ve\nbuilt might, unintentionally, not be what you wanted or what you need.\nHaving a solid short-term plan is also very helpful, as it lets agencies\nschedule their developers efficiently on your project. In fact, some agencies\nprefer to let work queue up until they have a sprint\u2019s worth on your project\nbefore prioritizing it. Frequently changing what you\u2019re asking for is\nfrustrating for development agencies, as it makes it hard for the agency to to\nplan the project longer term and to gauge when it\u2019ll finish your project and\nwhen it can take on new work.\nAbove  all, just like you would with an internal team, look at an external\ndevelopment agency as a partner. Be respectful of the agency\u2019s skills, time,\nand needs, and it\u2019ll likely do g reat work for you.\nHowever, while there are many great external development firms, there are\nsome sketchy ones, so you should know a few warning signs. Like when\nyou\u2019re buying a used car, if your contact keeps telling you what a great value\nyou\u2019re getting, he\u2019s likely overcharging you. If your contact never asks\nquestions to clarify each user story or make an effort to clarify and deliver\nthe acceptance criteria, you should be wary. If your contact ignores questions\nyou ask except on your check-in calls, you should also be alert.\nBe watchful of how agile agencies assign story points to user stories for\nwhich they use a pre-built in-house framework. Specifically, many agencies\nhave built up libraries of common functions, such as server code for account\nmanagement. A good agency that\u2019s using its library to complete user stories\nwill estimate these user stories as \u201ceasy.\u201d This is honest and lets you\ncalculate sprint velocity effectively. A sketchy agency will list a hard\nestimate for the user stories, claiming all the original work it took to develop", "the library as part of your story, even though it\u2019s trivial for the agency to\nimplement. Then the agency will tell you how much it kicked butt for the\nsprint because its team accomplished hundreds of story points, even though it\nreally only did 10 story points\u2019 worth of work. That claim messes up the\nsprint velocity and planning calculations, and it\u2019s a sure sign you should find\na new agency.\nNo matter where your team members are located, whether they\u2019re in-house\nor external, and whether they use Kanban or waterfall, we say that the\ndevelopment phase of the product life cycle is done when working, tested\nsoftware that meets your product requirements is ready for release. Your role\nduring the development phase comes down to providing clear requirements\nfor the engineering team members, working with them to prioritize and\nreprioritize as needed, and trusting them to build great code. Now that we\u2019ve\nbuilt our product, let\u2019s look at how we launch and market it.\n________ \nCHAPTER 7 TIP\nMoham mad Musa, a Produc t School instructor, provides this chapter\u2019s tip.\nMoham mad is cofounde r of a stealth start-up focused on virtual reality for\nenterprises. He used to work at Google on company wide efforts to enable\nteams to build produc ts more effectively. He worked specifically on\ninfrastructure produc ts for tracking user-centered metrics, bug\nmanage ment, and user-feedbac k loops . Prior to that, he was the head of", "Launc h & Readiness at Google Apps for Work, where he led a cross-\nfunctional team managi ng product launc hes, produc t roadm ap, trusted\ntester, and launc h communications. Before joining Google, Moham mad\nworked in software engineering and technical sales positions in the video\ngames and s emiconduc tor indus tries, mostly in small start-ups.\nWORKING WITH JUNIOR DEVELOPMENT TEAMS\nIf you are a software PM, you will need to work hand-in-hand with the software engineering manager\n(often called tech lead manager or TLM in companies like Google, Facebook, and Twitter). The TLM\nmanages a number of software engineers with variable seniority levels. The more senior engineers are\noften referred to as tech leads (TLs). The TLs may or may not have management responsibility over\nthe other team members.\nThe TL reports to the TLM and handles most of the day-to-day work assignment and helps the team\nunblock technical challenges for a particular project.\nIf you are lucky, you will be working with an experienced TLM and/or TL who has mentored and\nmanaged many engineers in the past. The TLM or TL will take care of training and advising the junior\ndevelopers on the team without requiring extra cycles from you as the PM.\nHowever, in reality you don\u2019t always get an experienced TL or TLM. Or sometimes you may get a\ngreat but busy TLM that has 15-plus engineers reporting to him/her. In these cases, your role as the PM\nwill need to expand to best help the team succeed. In my experience, I found that working with junior\ndevelopers requires the PM to do more work around scrum management, quality, and product or feature\ndefinition.\nFirst off, with regards to scrum, the junior developers are not used to user story estimation. Their\nestimates are usually off and they often think that a story is complete while there is still a lot of work left\nto be done. These premature stories can cause embarrassment in front of stakeholders if not enough\nQA has been completed. Second, and closely related to the first point, you really need to do a lot more\nQA around the work that junior developers have completed. You may not have a QA team at all and\neven if you do, the scripted tests may not catch all the errors that have been introduced by someone\nwho does not know the system very well. This is exacerbated in complex software systems that are\nalready suffering from coverage and quality problems.\nFinally, around requirements and definition: As the PM, you need to assume that the junior team", "members are like new users who have only casually used your product. You can\u2019t count on quick\nhallway or chat conversations to agree on minor details and just move on. You really have to document\nand make sure that junior team members have internalized what you are asking them to do. This will\ninclude more detailed user story descriptions, detailed mocks and user journeys/scenarios, and detailed\nacceptance criteria.\nWithin six to eight sprints, the junior members will better understand the product complexities and\nrequirements. To speed up understanding and shorten the learning curve, it would be ideal for your team\nto develop more user empathy. Encourage your engineering team to monitor user research sessions or\nconduct informal customer-discovery conversations with users directly (if possible). More knowledge of\nthe user persona and their pain points helps the entire team become more experienced and helps junior\ndevelopers take more ownership and pride in their work.", "At this point you\u2019ve found an opportunity, validated it, gotten your team on\nboard, and built a product. You\u2019ve done a lot! In fact, if you come from an\nengineering or design background, you might feel like the hard work\u2019s over\nand you can take a vacation. But for a product manager, there\u2019s still more\nwork to do to get your product into the market successfully. As the team at\nPragmatic Marketing, a product-marketing-focused agency, puts it, \u201cLaunch\nisn\u2019t the end of development but rather the beginning of selling.\u201d\nAs much as we\u2019d like to believe that if we built the perfect product it will\nsell itself, the harsh truth is that it won\u2019t. If none of your target customers\nknow about, find, or buy your product, it will flop. If the wrong people buy", "your product, they won\u2019t be happy and your product will flop. Unless you\nhave a solid plan to bring your product to market, it will most likely flop.\nFortunately, marketing and sales teams exist to make sure the right customers\nlearn about, find, and buy your product!\nTo ensure a successful launch, you will work closely with the marketing\nteam. Some companies even have a second role within marketing related to\nproduct management, the product marketing manager (PMM). Put simply, the\nPMM is focused externally and is an expert on the customer\u2014and the buyer, if\nthat\u2019s not the same person, such as in enterprise software\u2014whereas the PM\nwill focus internally on getting the product built. Companies that have a PM\nand a PMM call the PM \u201cinbound\u201d and a PMM \u201coutbound\u201d to reflect this\ndiffering focus.\nWorkflow-wise, the PMM will often handle customer development and\noutreach, the PM will take that feedback and research and get the right product\nbuilt, and the PMM will step back in for launch. During launch, a PMM is\nresponsible for figuring out how to explain the product to the customers,\ncrafting the right go-to-market (GTM) plan to bring the product to market\nsuccessfully, and helping the sales team. We\u2019ll go through this chapter as if the\nPM and the PMM are the same person to give you the best understanding of\nhow product and marketing come together during launch.\nBy representing the customer, the marketing and sales team will often ask for\nthe PM\u2019s input when forming strategies. For example, if your product is aimed\nat teens, the PM will know that teens currently use Snapchat and Instagram\nmore than Facebook . The marketing team will use that input as a starting point\nto determine where to buy display ads. While you won\u2019t be responsible for\nthe details of buying display ads, your input will affect where those ads are\nand what they say.", "Throughout this chapter, we\u2019ll look at launch preparation, at the launch itself,\nand a bit at post-launch activities. Launch preparation starts way before the\nproduct launches with understanding your customers and product messaging.\nEven though we\u2019re covering this material after the product\u2019s been built, you\nwill implement this advice while you\u2019re building this product.\nWhether you\u2019re releasing a new version of an existing product with minor\nfixes or releasing a completely new big product, the advice in this chapter\nwill help you. You\u2019ll just adjust the scale appropriately. A bug-fix release\ndoesn\u2019t need a press tour, for example.\nUNDERSTANDING CUSTOMERS\nTo market your product successfully, you\u2019ll need to know how your customers\nmake decisions. Thinking about marketing early on, even when you\u2019re doing\nyour initial customer development, will help your product enter the market\nsuccessfully. For example, your customers might expect to buy your product at\nBest Buy. It can take months for your sales team to set up the relationship so\nthat your product is available in store, which means you can\u2019t wait until\nlaunch to start the process.\nBack in Chapter 3, we introduced the Business Model Canvas and the Value\nPropos ition Canvas. At the time, we used them to help look for a product\noppor tunity. We can use the same tools to understand how to best market our\nproduct to the right customers by looking at different parts of the canvas. For\nreference, Figure 8-1 shows the Business Model Canvas (also shown in\nChapter 3 as Figure 3-5).", "Figure 8-1: The Business Model Canvas, from http://strategyzer.com, provides insight for how to\nmarket your product.\nThese are the key areas to focus on from a marketing point of view:\nCustomer segments: Who are the key personas?\nValue propositions: What\u2019s the benefit/value each persona will gain\nfrom your product?\nChannels: How does the company reach each persona?\nCustomer relationships: What communication level and type does\neach persona expect?\nRevenue streams: How much and how often will the customer pay?\nAs you do your customer research, you\u2019ll want to fill out these blocks and\nexpand your persona to include the marketing side. Here are some specific\nthings to make sure your personas address:", "How the persona would consider your product a success\nHow the persona perceives your product/company (if you have an\nexisting product)\nWhat buying criteria the persona has\nHow the persona evaluates products (e.g., does he expect a free\ntrial?)\nHow the persona perceives your competition\nWhat influence this persona has on the buying process\nBy fleshing out the marketing side of a persona, you\u2019ll help the marketing team\nmake successful decisions. For example, your persona might focus on new\nparents who look for advice online. Then the marketing team will do\nadditional research to determine what parenting websites and blogs the actual\ncustomers read, along with where they buy diapers and other supplies. In\nother words, once you know what your personas are, you and the team can\nfigure out what channels the customers they represent use to learn about and\npurchase new products. That lets your team make choices, like where to buy\nadvertising, so that the right people find your product.\nThe Customer Relationship block will help your team determine how to\nreach these customers, too. With an enterprise product and a high-value\ncustomer that purchases a lot of licenses, the customer likely expects her\naccount manager to talk to her personally and maybe even come to her office\nto give a demo. Again, make sure the choices you make for customer\nrelationships match your customers\u2019 expectations.\nSometimes, especially if you\u2019re releasing a completely new version of a\nproduct, you\u2019ll want to call out any customer segments the product isn\u2019t ready\nfor yet. For example, when Apple released Final Cut Pro X, which was a", "completely rewritten version of Final Cut, it left out certain advanced features\nand waited for customer feedback to determine which to add back in. This\nalso meant that Apple explicitly didn\u2019t market the product to customers they\nknew needed those advanced features, as those customers wouldn\u2019t have been\nsatisfied with this new version.\nProduct Messaging\nOne of the most important things the Business Model Canvas and the Value\nPropos ition Canvas can help you and your team determine is the right product\nmessage. Specifically, how do you communicate your product\u2019s value to\ncustomers and explain why they should care and what problems your product\nsolves? These canvases can help because they specifically ask you to think\nabout your customers\u2019 needs, problems, and goals along with what problems\nyour product solves and what benefits it provides to your target customers.\nFraming your product in this way\u2014why should the customer care?\u2014helps\nwith everything from how you\u2019ll sell the product to what features really\nmatter. It\u2019s so important that back in Chapter 5, we recommended including at\nleast a first pass at your product\u2019s core message in the PRD. If you don\u2019t think\nabout the customers you\u2019re trying to reach and why they should care, then it\nwill be much harder to find customers. For example, if you\u2019re working on a\nnew version of a student-loan product, your focus will be on getting students\nand recent graduates to care about and buy your product.\nBefore you start creating your product\u2019s message, make sure you really\nunderstand the customer personas you\u2019re targeting and how your product fits\ntheir life. The Value Propos ition Canvas, especially, will help you see those\nconnections. In an ideal world, we\u2019d come up with one universal message that\naddresses all of your personas, but we\u2019ll likely need different messages for", "each persona.\nUsing the same message for every persona is like starting every letter you\nsend with \u201cDear sir,\u201d even if the recipient is a woman. And the same way that\nyou wouldn\u2019t greet someone in person with \u201cDear sir,\u201d you\u2019ll likely have\ndifferent messages for different mediums, from website to email to video ad.\nIn other words, it won\u2019t just be the message language that changes. Different\npersonas will want different value propos itions and care about different\nfeatures/use cases. A stay-at-home dad will likely care more about a car\u2019s\nsafety rating than its horsepower, whereas a dad having a midlife crisis will\ncare more about horsepower.\nPMs are frequently responsible for the first pass at a product\u2019s messages and\nwill have input into the various forms these messages takes. Let\u2019s dive into\nhow to craft a great message. We\u2019re going create a message by putting some\nnotes together around the elements that go into a message and then putting\nthose notes together into a message.\nKey Elements of Your Product\u2019s Message\nWe\u2019ll start our notes by thinking about the product\u2019s themes, which we talked\nabout in Chapter 2. There are three key questions our theme should answer:\nWhy is this product/company important? Why are you doing this? What\u2019s\nspecial about your company\u2019s mission that will make a customer want your\nproduct over a competitor\u2019s? Ideally there will be one fundamental theme that\nanswers those three questions. Grab a blank sheet of paper and start writing\ndown what you think your company\u2019s core theme is. Revise what you write as\nneeded to make sure that theme applies to all three questions.\nLet\u2019s write down Moove r\u2019s theme. Moove r\u2019s founders created the company\nbecause they found planning a move to be overwhelmingly stressful,", "especially while working full-time. Their core theme is making moving as\nstress-free as possible so that it\u2019s easy for you to get to where you want to\nlive. While we might never explicitly say those words to customers, that\ntheme will guide our product messaging.\nAnother element to look at is what\u2019s fresh and new about the product: What\nare we building a message for? On your sheet of paper, create a new section\nwhere you list what\u2019s fresh and new. In Moove r\u2019s case, it\u2019s the chat feature.\nNote that the \u201cfresh and new\u201d part might differ for new versus existing\ncustomers. With Moove r, we can specifically tell existing customers about the\nmessaging feature. But when we try to reach new customers, we likely have to\neducate them about Moove r in general first, and the chat feature will be a\nbullet point beneath the main message. This is a common problem companies\nface, and it\u2019s just another reason you\u2019ll need different messages for different\ncustomers.\nRather than telling people about these fresh and new features, though, we\nwant to talk about the benefits they provide to the customer, using the\nunderlying theme and the customer\u2019s problems/needs to affect our diction.\nNext to each new feature you listed, write why the customer should care and\nhow this feature relates to the theme.\nMoove r\u2019s chat feature lets customers communicate with moving companies\nat the customers\u2019 convenience, not only from 9am to 5pm. We could rephrase\nthis to explain why a customer should care by writing, \u201cNever stress about\nmissing a phone call from the movers: talk with them on your schedule.\u201d\nContinuing with crafting your message, how is your product different and\nbetter than what the customer\u2019s doing now? This is especially relevant in the\nmessaging for new customers. In another section on your paper, create \u201cNow\u201d\nand \u201cFuture\u201d columns and write out what the customer\u2019s doing now and why", "your product, especially with this new feature, is better.\nRight now, Moove r\u2019s customers, both existing and potential, have to stress\nabout answering phone calls and not missing emails from moving companies,\neven when they\u2019re really busy dealing with life. We could further refine our\nmessage by saying, \u201cWe\u2019re taking the hassle out of talking to movers.\u201d This is\ngreat because it quickly encompasses all types of communication: \u201ctalking\u201d\ncan mean via phone or email. And we\u2019re saying why Moove r is better: it\u2019s\nhassle-free. This version of our message is also strong because it\u2019s positive\n(the previous message started with the negative \u201cnever\u201d) and it\u2019s in the\ncustomer\u2019s diction (\u201ctalking\u201d rather than \u201ccommunicating\u201d and \u201chassle\u201d rather\nthan \u201cstress\u201d).\nAnother aspect of your message is to address what someone\u2019s first\nimpression of your product might be, and whether you need to influence that\nimpression. Our first impressions have a big effect on our attitudes. For\nexample, the first time you see 3D software like Unity, it will look\noverwhelming and complex. Unity addresses this on its website by\nspecifically stating, \u201cYou can create any 2D or 3D game with Unity. You can\nmake it with ease.\u201d As another example, CleverPet is a game console for\ndogs, and at first glance it looks like it\u2019s just the memory game Simon even\nthough it costs $299. CleverPet\u2019s website explicitly calls out that it\u2019s \u201cOne\nhub. Unlimited games.\u201d This wording influences your first impression to know\nthat it\u2019s more than just Simon, and it helps justify the $299 pr ice.\nIn your notes for your product, write down what you feel each persona\u2019s first\nimpression of your product will be. If you need to influence that impression,\nwrite dow n how you want to shift the perception.\nFinding Your Company\u2019s Voice", "After you\u2019ve assembled your notes, you\u2019ll want to think about your voice.\nThis refers to the diction and tone you will use in your marketing and\nadvertising materials, possibly also even inside the product, such as in alert\nmessages. Basically, do you want to have a very formal tone with your\ncustomers, a casual tone, a \u201chip\u201d tone, or something in between?\nEnterprise products traditionally have taken a formal tone to create a\n\u201cbusiness\u201d feeling and consumer products have adopted a casual tone to\ncreate a friendly and accessible feeling. The overriding trend now for both\nenterprise and consumer products is to have a more casual and authentic tone.\nHowever, some B2B products in highly regulated fields like medicine and\nfinance still have to use very formal and specific voices because the wrong\nlanguage can get you into legal trouble.\nSome companies will create formal style guidelines for their brand\u2019s voice\nand require everything, from alert panels in the product to every ad, to\nconform to those guidelines. This can make it hard to adapt your message for\ndifferent customers. Instead, we recommend having a general sense of the\nvoice you want your brand to have, but use that as a starting point and not a\nrequired approach. Just make sure you stay consistent within each\nmedium/message! It\u2019s confusing if you start a letter with \u201cDear sir\u201d and then\nswitch to \u201cHey, dude\u201d in the next paragraph.\nUsing similar diction to your customers can help your customers quickly\nunderstand your value propos ition. With consumer products, this means not\nusing industry jargon\u2014you\u2019ll likely need to cross out and rewrite some of\nyour \u201cwhy should the customer care?\u201d descriptions. For example, Microsoft\ndescribes its Surface devices as \u201cthe most productive devices on the planet\u201d\nand goes on to describe the Surface Book as \u201cthe ultimate laptop.\u201d Right\naway, you know if you\u2019re looking for a high-end laptop, this is the product you", "want to look at. If you want something to just browse the web, you also know\nthis isn\u2019t the right product. If Microsoft had instead listed each device\u2019s CPU\nspecs, most customers wouldn\u2019t know which product to look at.\nWith enterprise software or specific, targeted products, you often want to\nuse certain buzzwords that a customer is looking for. For example, if a head of\nIT at a hospital is looking to buy a medical records system, he likely cares\nabout compliance with government regulations. Calling out a specific\ncompliance level as part of the message helps him quickly know this product\nexactly meets his needs.\nA simple way to make sure you\u2019re using the right diction is to ask how a\ncustomer would tell a friend about your product. If their diction is similar to\nyours, excellent! If it\u2019s very different, reconsider your word choice. You want\nyour message to match how your customers see the world. Your message gets\nbonus points if it really creates images and evokes emotions in a customer\u2019s\nmind.\nPutting the Message Pieces Together\nIf you were following along, you now have a few pages of notes and ideas for\nhow you could tell a customer about your product. That\u2019s excellent because,\nagain, there\u2019s no one message that works for all personas on all mediums. For\nexample, what you write in a press release will be different from what\u2019s on\nthe product\u2019s web page, and that will be different from how you advertise the\nproduct on TV. As another example, how many websites have you gone to that\nessentially ask you to pick your persona by choosing between text like \u201cFor\ndevelopers\u201d or \u201cFor designers\u201d? The messaging will be different on each\npage, focusing on the things each of those personas cares about.\nWhile you won\u2019t be responsible for creating ads, it\u2019s worth looking at ads to", "understand how other companies express their messages. Spend some time\nlooking at websites and watching ads for products you use, or know about.\nWhat is the company saying about each product? Is the message explicit or\nimplicit? What diction or imagery does the company use?\nVideo advertising is really interesting to analyze because the message is\noften implicit, and you\u2019ll have to think about what the company was trying to\nsay. Then note how it chose to convey it: What personas did it appeal to?\nHow did it make those personas clear? What emotions did the ad create?\nWatch Apple\u2019s classic 1984 ad or Google\u2019s Parisian Love ad to see two\nfantastic examples. 1984 focuses on how Macintosh enables you to stand out\nand break free of your constraints. Parisian Love examines how search\nchanges your life by giving you the answers you need. It\u2019s also worth\nexplicitly noting that these ads don\u2019t focus on the product\u2014they focus on your\nlife, the experience you want, and how the product helps you have that\nexperience.\nIn general, it\u2019s good to figure out the shortest possible message that appeals\nto the most personas. You\u2019ll likely use that message a lot, whether as a sound\nbite during a meeting with the press or as the headline on the product\u2019s page.\nThen, create different, more specific, and more targeted messages as needed,\nusing your notes to guide you.\nWe highly recommend taking a stab at determining this short message early\nin the product-development life cycle and then revising it as needed. This will\nhelp keep any product decisions focused (do they enhance/detract from the\nmessage?) and provide a starting point for discussions about how to bring the\nproduct to market.\nJust like writing user scenarios for stakeholders is the secret to good PRDs,\nwriting your message as a story can help it become clear and resonate more", "with customers. You can even use it to give increased value to something new\nthat might not seem exciting. For example, if your new feature is a tutorial\nsection on the website, tell a story about how the customer can use these\nsimple tutorials to become an expert on the product very quickly, leaving their\npeers in the dust.\nFinally, remember that your message is not about what the product does, it\u2019s\nabout what the product lets the customer do. Customers buy your product to\nmake their lives better. Make sure your message clearly highlights how your\nproduct will help your customers improve their lives.\nGOING TO MARKET\nIt\u2019s tempting to think that once development\u2019s done and you\u2019ve put together an\ninitial product message in the PRD, you can just give the product to\nmarketing/sales and let them do their thing. But what happens if during launch\nyour server crashes and your engineering team is out of the office celebrating?\nOr worse, what if the marketing team didn\u2019t fully understand the product\u2019s\nnew features, targeted the wrong PR/advertising outlets, and no one showed\nup for the launch?\nMany companies create launch checklists, preset templates of the\ninformation the marketing team needs to launch a product. But the problem is\nthat not every product launch is the same, either in terms of the product you\u2019re\nlaunching or how people receive information. For example, a big product\nlaunch might warrant an event that you live-stream. Five years ago, live\nstreaming wasn\u2019t an easy option. In a couple of years, live streaming in virtual\nreality or some other way we can\u2019t imagine now might be the norm. And if\nyou\u2019re launching a new version of a small feature, you likely don\u2019t need a live\nstream at all.", "A great way to launch a product is to identify a launch owner early on, to\nform a team with representatives from each key group (Design, Engineering,\nProduct, Support, and Marketing), and to establish clear launch objectives and\nresponsibilities within a go-to-market (GTM) plan. Sometimes the launch\nowner is the PM, but PMs are often busy enough that someone else from the\nmarketing team will take on this role. Although the launch owner will\norganize and manage the GTM plan, each department will contribute to it.\nEach week, the team will meet to make sure everything is on track to ensure a\nsuccessful launch, and they\u2019ll communicate any delays or issues and discuss\nsolutions.\nFor these meetings, it\u2019s helpful to create a launch tracker to organize the\nlaunch. Three sheets in a spreadsheet are sufficient. The first sheet will\ncontain the action items. These are specific tasks, assigned to a particular\nperson/team, along with when each task was assigned, when it was due, and\nany comments/status updates appropriate for the task. The second sheet will\ncontain caution items. These are possible problem issues along with who\nraised them, when they raised them, when each issue was resolved, and any\ncomments. The last sheet will have key decisions, including who made them,\nwhen, and any comments. In the same way the PRD is a living document that\nacts as the key product resource as you build the product, this launch tracker\nwill be your launch reference.\nA lot of the work you\u2019ve done so far, from identifying your target customers\nto analyzing the competition to developing product messages for each\npersona, will inform your overall strategy and influence the decisions you\nmake within the GTM plan. Keep those in mind as you read this section!\nAt a high level, the GTM plan is subdivided into three sections: prelaunch,\nlaunch, and pos tlaunch. Let\u2019s look at each.", "Prelaunch Planning\nThe main things to decide during prelaunch are the key launch goals, how\nyou\u2019ll make sure the product is ready for that launch, when and how you\u2019ll\nlaunch the product, and what assets you need to launch.\nLaunch Objectives\nLaunches have different purposes. For some products, like the latest Google\nPixel smartphone, the goal is likely to get as many customers as possible\nupgrading to this phone or new customers buying the phone. For enterprise\nsoftware like Salesforce, the goal might be getting a subset of customers\nengaged with a new feature. Sometimes the goal is simply awareness of a new\nfeature so that when customer enter their buying cycle, your product is on their\nmind.\nIdentifying your key goals up front will let you make other launch decisions,\nsuch as when to aim to launch your product.\nLaunch Timing\nAfter the launch objective, most launch teams identify when they want to\nlaunch the product. Sometimes this is a specific date, but usually it\u2019s a date\nrange. For example, consumer product launches tend to happen at the start of\nthe year, in late April/early May for the \u201cdads and grads\u201d window (Father\u2019s\nDay and graduation), or after the summer but before Black Friday.\nIt\u2019s important to pick this launch window as early as possible because it can\naffect your product\u2019s development. If you\u2019re selling a consumer product and\nthe development team thinks it will be ready to launch December 26, then\nyou\u2019ll have missed the entire window from Black Friday to Christmas, when\nconsumer products sell well. If you want to have the product available for\nholiday shopping, you\u2019ll need to reduce your product\u2019s scope to have it ready", "in time.\nBusinesses sometimes have buying periods, too, that you might need to time\nyour launch around. Schools often purchase products in the spring and\nsummer, before the start of the next school year. Sometimes companies have\nextra money in their budget they need to spend before the end of the year, so\nthey\u2019ll buy more in December. Understanding your customers and their buying\nhabits will help you identify the best launch window for your product.\nFor feature releases for existing products, the launch timing depends on the\nlaunch type and goal. If it\u2019s a big update that will encourage new customers to\nbuy your product, then you\u2019ll likely treat it like a new product and align the\nrelease with your customers\u2019 buying habits. Smaller releases\u2019 timing varies a\nlot. The only rule of thumb for these smaller releases is to release earlier in\nthe week so that if any support issues arise your team doesn\u2019t have to work\nover the weekend to resolve them.\nIf the feature is a bug fix for a critical security issue, then your launch goal is\nto get this into as many customers\u2019 hands as possible, as soon as possible. If\nit\u2019s a small update designed to improve the product for existing customers,\nyour goal will also be to get as many existing customers as possible to update,\nbut it\u2019s not as urgent. If your customer has to explicitly take an inconvenient\naction to upgrade, like restarting a computer, you\u2019ll want to schedule your\nreleases to balance the value of the release with the inconvenience of\nupgrading. Fortunately, newer tools like the Mac App Store and the Windows\nStore are making upgrades easier for customers, automatically handling the\ninconvenient actions like restarting when customers are away from their\ncomputers.\nA common question is, What does launc h mean and how do you pick a date\nwhen you have an agile team, producing usable products at the end of each", "sprint or cycle? It depends! For small features and bug fixes, often companies\ndon\u2019t even bother with a launch plan, and just deploy the feature when it\u2019s\nready (just not on Friday). For larger releases, such as an important new\nfeature, the company might choose to deploy the code internally but not\nrelease it publicly until a certain date.\nScrum makes this easy because you will pick a sprint whose date aligns with\nyour launch window to be the release sprint. Velocity calculations and story\npoint estimations will give you a good idea about what work will be\navailable on that date. It\u2019s always smart to have the prerelease sprint be\ndevoted to any last-minute, launch-related tasks that come up, and during the\nprelaunch phase you can make sure that each sprint is on track towards\nrelease. During each launch team meeting, one discussion point will be, Is\neverything still on track product-wise? If you find the velocity dropping, you\nmight have to adjust your release plans.\nOnce you\u2019ve picked a possible launch date, you\u2019ll establish a work-back\nschedule to determine what tasks you need to do when in preparation for\nlaunch\u2014i.e., the week before launch, you\u2019ll do press briefings\u2014two weeks\nbefore, all video assets need to be ready\u2014and so on.\nTesting\nAs part of getting ready to launch your product, it\u2019s important to put a plan\ntogether to test it with real customers so that you can make sure the product\nwill deliver on its success metrics. Generally, companies first do an internal\nrelease of a product. The goal is to make sure everything works as expected\nand to catch major bugs before showing the product to any external customers.\nNext, companies do a broader beta, where they open up the product to a\nsmall group of external customers. This might be via an exclusive invitation to", "the top contributors on your support forum or via some automatic opt-in.\nThe former is a better approach for bigger releases, where you have specific\nnew features you want customers to test. Creating a select group of customers\nto give early access is useful because it gives you a group of people who\nactively use your product, and they\u2019re the most likely to use the new features\nand to have valuable feedback. Early access also makes these customers feel\nspecial, and they\u2019ll often want to share that status with the world when your\nproduct is released. Specifically, this group often becomes product experts,\nproviding tips and support to other customers and advoc ating for your product\namong their peers.\nAutomatic opt-in is most common with web apps with a large number of\nusers, where you can enable the feature for a short period of time for 1% of\nyour customers and get valuable feedback. Automatic opt-in is fantastic\nbecause it gives you real data from real customers, likely exposing the\nproduct to far more customers than would manually opt in to a beta test. But it\nmakes it hard to keep the new product a secret, just look at how often people\nreport seeing new Facebook  features before there\u2019s an official announcement.\nAutomatic opt-in might also generate complaints or a temporary drop in your\nsuccess metrics, but that data will help you improve the product so it has a\nsuccessful launch. Many companies have built internal tools to allow for\nselective feature roll-out/testing, and LaunchDarkly has built a general-\npurpose tool that anyone can use.\nThe key to planning a beta is thinking about how perfect your launch needs to\nbe. If your product is a mobile app and new customers find it buggy, they\u2019re\ngoing to delete it and likely never reinstall it. Hardware is even less forgiving\nbecause a customer will return your product, and that costs you money to deal\nwith. Web apps tend to be very forgiving, as you can update them multiple", "times an hour without the customer having to do anything. Of course, if you\u2019re\nstrictly adhering to Lean methodology, you will do minimal if any testing and\njust keep releasing as fast as possible. But as we\u2019ve mentioned before, most\ncompanies take a hybrid approach, which means you\u2019ll have some type of\nbeta.\nYou will either own or be heavily involved in product testing. A few key\nthings will help you run a successful beta test:\nMake sure your beta group matches your target persona(s). This\nwill ensure that the people testing are the people you want to reach.\nTest your product messaging with any outreach you do. If you\nemail certain customers to invite them to the beta, include the product\nmessaging you think will make them want to use the product. It\u2019s also\npossible to A/B-test messages to the same persona so that you can test\nwhich message gets the most people to sign up for the beta.\nEnsure you have appropriate onboarding. Onboarding is the first\nexperience a customer has with your product or updated version. In\nthe shipping product and later betas, it\u2019s usually where you call out\nkey features and explain why they\u2019re useful and relevant. In a beta\ncontext, onboarding is extra important because it includes any specific\ntesting instructions, such as what part of the product to specifically\ntest or parts that you know don\u2019t work right yet. Sometimes an\nonboarding experience is as simple as a release-notes email with\ninstructions for installing the beta.\nHave feedback mechanisms in place. Make sure you have", "quantitative analytics tools in place to measure against your success\nmetrics and to capture any crash logs, provide a qualitative feedback\nmechanism like Qualaroo or UserVoice so that customers can tell you\nwhat they think and reach you with any issues, and follow up with\ncustomers to see what they think. Special beta forums can provide a\ngreat way for beta testers to interact, provide feedback, and help each\nother out. The key pieces of feedback to look for are the product\u2019s\ndiscoverability, engagement, repetition (people come back to use it),\nactual use cases, and any barriers to adoption.\nAssess your feedback and use it to inform launch decisions. Beta\ntests give you a chance to see if your product addresses customers\u2019\nneeds successfully, and help you meet your success metrics with a\nsmall group. This gives you useful data about things you\u2019ll want to\naddress before launch, like what bugs or other barriers to adoption\nmany customers encountered. Sometimes you\u2019ll find a feature isn\u2019t\ndiscoverable and you need to add a callout to it specifically, or an\nonboarding experience to walk customers through using it. Sometimes\nyou\u2019ll find something doesn\u2019t work as expected in the real world, and\nyou\u2019ll decide to remove the feature. Occasionally you\u2019ll find that the\nwhole product just isn\u2019t good and customers don\u2019t adopt it, and you\u2019ll\ncancel the launch. The most common result of a beta test is that you\nuse the results to make a few minor changes and bug fixes, and then\nyou do another beta test. After a couple of iterations with larger\nsample sizes in each, the product will be ready to launch.\nWhen putting together a GTM plan, establish when you want to run each\ntesting phase, what you\u2019re aiming to get out of each phase, and who will own", "it\u2014generally support or the PM will own the tests. Make sure to plan time to\nreact to feedback from the betas before launch.\nFor some products, you will also want to run stress tests with Engineering\nduring the prelaunch phase to make sure your technical capabilities can handle\nany demand. For example, some very popu lar products generate so much\ninterest that their web servers crash because of the sudden spike in visitors.\nIt\u2019s quite common to add a launch task for Engineering to scale up your virtual\nserver capacity during a launch window, until traffic has leveled off to a\npredictable level.\nWhat Kind of Launch?\nThink about product launches you\u2019ve seen before. Sometimes you just notice a\nnew button appear in the UX with a pop-up tip telling you to check out\nsomething new. Other times you don\u2019t get anything done for a couple hours\nbecause you\u2019re watching an Apple or Google presentation, large events we\ncall \u201cbig-bang launches.\u201d\nIt\u2019s important to align the type of launch you do with the product\u2019s scope and\nyour capability. If you don\u2019t, your product might flop or even become the\npunchline to a joke. Back in 2011, a mobile app photo-sharing start-up called\nColor focused on big-bang announcements. It received $41 million in funding\nright off the bat, which was huge. Then it launched its app with big fanfare,\nbut there was a problem\u2014Color focused on sharing with nearby users, but\nmost people who downloaded Color found they were the only one using the\napp nearby and stoppe d using it. Color\u2019s poor testing prelaunch failed to\ndiscover this problem. Over the next few months, the company made changes\nto address these problems, but it had lost its momentum and the company shut\ndown in 2012. Put simply, the product wasn\u2019t ready, the company did a big-", "bang launch, people gave the product a shot and were disappointed, and Color\nnever got a second chance.\nAlternatively, look at products like Gmail. Google tested it internally and\nthen launched it with an invite-only beta. In addition to giving Google a\nchance to discover and fix problems before Gmail was huge, it created a\nfeeling of exclusivity and demand for the product.\nNow imagine that the new feature you\u2019re responsible for is adding a \u201cwatch\noffline\u201d button to YouTube\u2019s mobile app. While this could be a great feature,\nyou likely don\u2019t need a huge event to launch it. Instead, working with the press\nto get articles on various tech and media news sites and letting existing users\nknow about the feature either in-app or via direct communication could be\nsufficient to achieve your launch goals\u2014likely adoption in this case.\nSmall events can be another great way to effectively launch and reach key\ninfluencers. For example, if Sonos were launching a new speaker lineup, it\ncould do the following: rent a mansion, fill it with the Sonos speaker system,\ncater the event, invite key customers, partners, and members of the tech and\naudiophile press, and expect these influencers to write for outlets Sonos\ncustomers read.\nSometimes, you\u2019ll work with a product that a customer really needs to\nexperience to understand, especially if it\u2019s an expensive product. Would you\nbuy a car just based on a review, or would you want to test-drive it first? For\nthese products, you\u2019ll need a launch strategy that is very hands-on-focused,\nboth for the initial launch and with follow-up events that let customers try the\nproduct. The VR/AR (virtual reality/augmented reality) space is a great\nexample. The best way for people to understand why VR/AR is compelling is\nfor them to try it themselves. When HTC released its high-end Vive VR\nsystem, it had a traveling roadshow where customers could try the Vive in", "specially built trailers.\nThese are the key things to think about for your launch type:\nWhich personas care about this feature, and what customers do they\nmap to?\nHow will you reach new customers?\nHow do y ou reach existing customers?\nWhat\u2019s your launch objective, beyond reaching the right customers\neffectively?\nIf you have a new product or a significant new version of an existing product,\nyou\u2019ll want to reach new customers and existing customers, and a large event\nmight be appropriate. If you have a big new feature, a small event or a series\nof press briefings focused on reaching existing customers and some new\ncustomers is likely more appropriate. If it\u2019s a small new feature, then reaching\nexisting customers is more important than securing press coverage.\nFor a small company struggling for attention, successful launches can be\nhard. You might do everything perfectly, but if customers don\u2019t show up, it\ndoesn\u2019t matter. One simple approach is to build up an email list of interested\ncustomers prelaunch. A \u201ctell me more\u201d landing page for your product is a\nsimple way to capture email addresses. This ensures that you\u2019re reaching\npeople who are explicitly interested in your product.\nYou\u2019ll want to make sure your outreach methods match your capability. If\nyou have a sales person who manually sends email and makes calls, will he\nbe able to handle the volume if you want him to reach out to thousands of\ncustomers the day your product launches?\nMany smaller companies choose to work with a PR agency that has", "connections at various media outlets to help get coverage in places your target\npersonas look. That\u2019s another reason that knowing how your target customers\nfind information\u2014pa rt of the Business Model Canvas\u2014is important: it lets\nyou be efficient!\nOnce you\u2019ve picked how you want to launch, you\u2019ll align your launch\nplanning on delivering what you need to make that method successful.\nLaunch Asset Planning\nNo matter how small of a launch event you\u2019re planning, the launch team will\nalways end up creating various assets to accompany the product launch. As\nthe product manager, you\u2019ll often have a hand in creating these launch assets,\neven though other people will handle the details. Specific launch assets to\nconsider include the following:\nWebsite updates. How will the product\u2019s page be updated on your\nwebsite?\nSupport documentation. What needs to be updated on your product\u2019s\nsupport page for the new version? Is there new training material to be\ncreated ahead of time?\nSample video/images. Do you need to create new screenshots for the\nApp Store or wherever you distribute the product?\nBlog posts and other social media material. What material do you\nwant to create for the product\u2019s launch on your company\u2019s blog/social\nmedia channels? These outlets are called owned media because you\ncontrol them, and you want to make sure they support your\nlaunch/company goals.", "Ads. Do you intend to have any advertising material with your product\nlaunch? If so, you\u2019ll need to create the media ahead of time.\nDemo plan. When company representatives are showing off the\nproduct, how will they demo the new product? Or if you\u2019re releasing\na new version/feature, how does it affect existing demo plans?\nDistribution review needs. Application stores like the App Store\noften require special reviewer logins or video demos so they can\nmake sure your app works as designed. Do you have to create\nanything for this process?\nInternal product FAQ. If you\u2019re planning on doing press briefings as\npart of the launch, it\u2019s also handy to create an internal product FAQ\nwith the questions you expect to get about the product from reporters.\nHaving clear, on-message answers to common questions, including\nany hard questions you might get, helps whomever is doing the press\nbriefings prepare effectively.\nSupport-team training materials. While the design, engineering, and\nproduct teams are likely quite familiar with the product when launch\ncomes around, the support teams might not be as familiar. Create\nmaterials for them with the most common problems customers will\nface, and the solutions. Use what you learned during your testing\nperiods to gauge the most likely problems. During and after launch,\nupdate these training materials with any new questions that arise.\nSales-team training materials. As with support, it\u2019s important to\ncreate materials for the sales team so that the reps clearly understand", "the value in the product. These materials should focus on\nunderstanding the key buyer personas and what the product offers for\nthem. For existing customers, be sure to provide migration information\nso that the sales team can help ensure smooth migrations.\nWhile not an explicit asset, make sure to work appropriately with any external\npartners so that they\u2019re not caught off guard by your launch. For example, with\nMoove r we\u2019d want to make sure the moving companies have been notified\nand helped test our messaging feature. We might even choose to launch the\nupdated web console with them quietly before launching the app to support a\nbeta test.\nA Helpful Prelaunch Marketing Framework\nThere is a marketing framework that\u2019s very handy for the launch team to keep\nin mind as they determine how to launch a product. This framework, called\nthe 4Ps Framework, is a guide to making marketing decisions and a reminder\nof key decisions you have to make when launching a product. The Ps stand for\nproduct, price, promotion, and place. Let\u2019s dive into each.\nProduc t includes both the obvious parts of the product (what is it, who\u2019s it\nfor, what\u2019s the benefit?) along with the non-obvious. Non-obvious elements\ninclude the packaging, accessories, support, warranty, and return policy. A\nhelpful way to remember these non-obvious elements is that they\u2019re things the\ncustomer encounters after purchasing the product. For example, after you buy\nit, you unbox it. Or you buy an accessory. Or you have a problem and contact\nsupport.\nPrice refers to what you charge for\u2014bot h normal, everyday transactions and\nwith possible volume and sale discounts. Determining the right price can be", "quite complex, and it\u2019s influenced by your product goals and your desired\nbusiness model. Social games are often free to play to get as many people as\npossible downloading them, which enables a better social game. Then, ads\nhelp provide a small bit of income from each customer, and in-app purchases\nhelp generate revenue from engaged customers while also making the game\nbetter for them. Hardware pricing is commonly based on component pricing,\nbut sometimes companies use a razor/blade model and sell the core hardware\nat a loss, making money on software and accessories. As a product manager,\nyou\u2019ll often have input on the pricing strategy, as the price is influenced by\nyour product goals and has an impact on your success metrics and product\nplanning.\nThe next P is promotion. This is what we think of traditionally with\nmarketing: What will your press release be like? What ads will you create?\nHow will the sales team reach customers?\nFinally, we come to place. Where do your customers find your product for\nsale? Is it only on your website? Is it in specific stores, either virtual or\nphysical? The key here is to make sure the place lines up with where your\ntarget customers go to find products. Some customers don\u2019t feel safe buying\nfrom a no-name start-up\u2019s website, for example. They might be interested in\nyour product, but they\u2019ll hold off buying it until it\u2019s available on Amazon. Or\nperhaps customers expect your app to be on the Google Play store, and they\u2019ll\nlook for it there instead of in the Amazon app store. If you\u2019re not selling\nwhere your customers are, you\u2019ll miss out.\nLaunch\nThe nice thing about planning thoroughly before launch is that during launch\nyou\u2019re mainly executing on your plan, which is relatively relaxing and even", "fun!\nProduct managers are often company spokespeople, and we recommend\nworking with your communication team to make sure you speak well and\nknow the key product messages. And of course, if you\u2019re speaking externally,\ntake care to look your best, wash your hands, trim your nails, and present a\nprofessional image.\nBack in the office, the engineering and support teams will want to watch to\nensure everything is functioning correctly and customers are receiving any aid\nthey need. You, as the PM, will also want to work with them to look for any\ncritical bugs you might have missed during your testing phase. Have a plan in\nplace with Engineering ahead of time to asses, fix, and release these bugs as\nneeded. But beyond that, you can take a breath and watch how your customers\nreact to your hard work.\nWe call the social media posts your customers write, reviews your product\nreceives, and articles the press writes about your product earned media\nbecause you don\u2019t control it nor did you pay for it. Earned media is very\nvaluable because it means people find your product worth writing about. Of\ncourse the risk is that they don\u2019t like it and the earned media isn\u2019t positive.\nFortunately, most people, especially professionals, usually choose not to\nwrite a review rather than writing something negative.\nPostlaunch\nIn Chapter 9 we\u2019ll go into more detail for what you, the PM, will do\npostlaunch. Most of your work will be internally focused, assessing early\nresults and metrics and planning what\u2019s next. The marketing and sales teams\nwill focus on how to promote and sell the new, current version. We\u2019ll briefly\ndefine some terms you might hear when working with those teams.", "The Customer Life Cycle\nJust like we think about product funnels with analytics (covered back in\nChapter 3), marketing also thinks about funnels. Sort of. Product marketing has\nbecome complex enough that many people think about engaging with\ncustomers as a loop c alled the customer life cycle.\nCustomers often start their journey with the awareness, interest, and\nengagement phases. This simply means people know about your product and\nseek to learn more. Marketing teams often pay for display and social ads to\nget more customers at this part of the funnel. A display ad is the typical visual\nadvertisement we think of, such as an ad in a magazine or a banner ad. A\nsocial ad is an ad you pay for on a social network, whether it\u2019s a text ad on\nTwitter or an image on Instagram. What marketers love about online marketing\nis that it can be very targeted. Unlike a newspaper ad that lots of people see,\nonline ads can be shown only to 31-year-old women who are interested in\ncasual video games. This helps ensure your advertising reaches the right\npersonas!\nThe next life cycle phase is about getting people to trust your product will\ndeliver on its promise and to buy it\u2014offering money-back guarantees is a\ncommon technique here. It often includes seeking out peer opinions and doing\nresearch on the product, such as looking for reviews. Affiliate marketing can\nhelp move customers through these steps. Affiliate marketing is when a trusted\nsource receives a small payment for encouraging its audience to buy your\nproduct. Customers are happy because they now feel they can trust your\nproduct, affiliates are happy because they received a payment for their expert\nadvice, and your company\u2019s happy because you have a new customer.\nSometimes companies provide special deals for their affiliate partners, such\nas discount codes, which gives new customers even more incentive to", "purchase your product.\nThe last phases of the customer life cycle are about customer satisfaction\nand advoc acy. The ultimate goal of the customer life cycle is to have\ncustomers advoc ating for you. Word of mouth is one of the most important\nfactors in why people buy certain products, and it brings new customers into\nthe customer life cycle, making them aware of your product. While the support\nteam will play the largest role in this phase, ensuring customers have a\npositive experience, the marketing team will often also help with customer\nretention and loyalty so that they in turn recommend the product again. They\nmight do this by sending swag like T-shirts to customers or by sending special\noffers to get the customer to make another transaction. If you\u2019ve ever tried to\ncancel your cable, phone, or Internet service, you\u2019ve likely found yourself\ntalking to a person whose job is to do whatever it takes to retain you as a\ncustomer, such as offering you a fantastic deal.\nAs a customer moves through each phase, you\u2019ll need to make sure she sees\nthe appropriate messaging and material. You don\u2019t need to show a money-\nback guarantee\u2014which helps the trust phase\u2014when you\u2019re trying to just make\npeople aware of your product.\nThe different messaging is important when working with search engine\noptimization and marketing (SEO/SEM). This is an entire field, and we\u2019re not\ngoing to go into it in depth, but SEO refers to how you optimize your site so\nthat when people search for keywords, you\u2019re the relevant result. SEM is\nwhen you pay to have an ad for your website appear based on certain\nkeywords.\nMarketing Cost Measurement Terms\nWith all of these approaches, there are a few key terms you should be aware", "of, as they sometimes come up during strategy meetings between product and\nmarketing:\nPay per impression (PPI): You pay for the ad whenever it\u2019s shown.\nImpression means \u201csomeone saw the ad.\u201d\nPay per click (PPC): You pay for the ad only when someone clicks\non it.\nPay per action (PPA): You pay only when the user achieves some\nfinal action, such as dow nloading your app.\nClick-through rate (CTR): The percentage of people who click on\nyour ad.\nCost per impression (CPI)/cost per thousand impressions (CPM):\nThis is how much you pay to have your ad shown once (CPI)\u2014more\ncommonly listed as the cost to have it shown 1,000 times (CPM). This\ncan be used to assess how effective a campaign is. It\u2019s simply the\nadvertising cost divided by the number of impressions.\nCost per click (CPC): This is the actual price you pay for each click\nin your PPC advertising. In bid-based systems like on Google and\nBing, this might be lower than the price you entered. For example, if\nyou placed the highest bid at $2/click, which means you\u2019d pay at most\n$2 for each click, the actual amount you\u2019ll pay is based on various\nfactors such as the closest competitor\u2019s bid and your ad quality. CPC\nis often used when there\u2019s a daily budget for running display and\nsearch ads. When you hit your budget, you stop running the ad for the", "day. As you\u2019d expect, CPC is often CPI divided by CTR.\nCustomer lifetime value (CLV/LTV): How much money do you\nexpect to make from this customer over the product\u2019s lifetime? This is\nuseful for determining how much to spend advertising to this customer.\nThe CLV should be greater than what you spend to acquire the\ncustomer. If you have to spend $100 on display and affiliate\npromotions to acquire a customer but only expect to make $20 on this\ncustomer, you\u2019ll have lost money.\nMOOVER\u2019S GTM PLAN\nHere\u2019s a first pass at Moove r\u2019s GTM plan. The launch team will break these\ntasks down into explicit action items and assign them, and they might raise\nconcerns during launch for issues not listed here. But this should give you an\nunderstanding of how to start thinking about launching and marketing a\nproduct.\nKey message: Moove r takes the hassle out of planning a move.\nNew-feature message: Moover\u2019s new chat feature takes the hassle out of\ntalking with movers.\nPrelaunch\nHow we will test this internally? We\u2019ll ask for volunteers on various\nteams to help test the mobile app and web dashboard for 10 minutes\neach day over the course of two weeks. By using both aspects, they\ncan make sure everything goes through as they expected. Using the\nproduct for a few minutes each day is likely the most common use", "case. We\u2019ll also designate one person on the QA team to handle a\ndifferent fake company in the database so that she can test the \u201cmany\nclients/one response source\u201d system.\nHow will we test this externally? We will ship it and turn it on for a\nsmall group of customers with no special announcement and see how\nusage changes, if customers have problems, and more. It\u2019s tough to\ncreate a beta pool for moving customers because people move and\nthen don\u2019t do it again for a while. Letting customers try this feature\nalso means we\u2019ll have to roll out the web portal to our moving\ncompanies earlier, as they\u2019ll need to be able to answer messages.\nWe\u2019ll need to create training material for these companies and\nprovide support.\nHow will we launc h this? This is not a huge feature, so it doesn\u2019t\nneed much fanfare. However, because many people haven\u2019t heard of\nMoove r, we want to use this to help generate fresh articles about our\nproduct. We\u2019ll work with our PR firm to do a small press tour, and\nwe\u2019ll make sure the focus is on the core product message more than\nthis specific new feature. We\u2019ll need to come up with a sample demo\nflow for these briefings. Perhaps we can have a fake moving company\nthat automatically sends a series of replies on the back end so that it\nappears like you\u2019re having a real conversation with the company\nduring the press briefing.\nWhat assets do we need to create? We need training and support\nmaterials for our moving-company customers, updated screenshots\nand documentation for the website and app stores, and a blog post", "describing what\u2019s in this update.\nHow will we reach customers? We don\u2019t have frequently recurring\ncustomers, so reaching existing customers isn\u2019t a big concern. We can\ncontinue to promote Moove r in general on job boards like LinkedIn\n(given that after people get a new job, they often move).\nLaunch\nThere should be very little to do during launch, aside from updating the\nwebsite with new product information and releasing the updated app.\nWe\u2019ll want to make sure our website can handle an increased visitor load,\nbut given how infrequently people move, we don\u2019t expect a huge uptick in\nsimultaneous active users in the app. Given we see an average of 1,000 users\nper day, we could start by assuming that each user sends two chats per day to\nevery moving company he has a bid from. There\u2019s an average of five bids per\nuser. This means we should be prepared to handle 1000 * 2 * 5, or 10,000\nchats per day, which isn\u2019t a huge number. We can adjust capacity as needed\nafter things level off.\nPostlaunch\nWe will continue to promote Moove r as normal, especially focusing on\ntargeted display and search ads. The general message is still the key message\nto promote, as our app awareness isn\u2019t at the point where it\u2019s worth\nadvertising specific features initially.\nWe\u2019ll want to watch how often people use the chat feature to make sure it\u2019s\nsufficiently discoverable and intuitive.\nFor many in your company, especially the sales, marketing, and support\nteams, postlaunch is when they really go to work. For you, this is the last", "major step in the product-development life cycle. Read on to learn how to\nfinish up the life cycle.\n________ \nCHAPTER EIGHT TIP\nThis tip comes from an amazing produc t leader, Kirk Paulsen, SVP for\nMarketing at DxO. For more than a decade, Kirk directed worldwide\nproduc t marketing for all photo software and cloud-based services from\nApple\u2019s headqua rters in Cupertino. As an executive for start-ups Sonic and\nthen Spr uce, he helped launc h the world\u2019s first commercially available DVD\nencoding and authoring systems. Kirk was also one of the first technology\nexperts to introduc e the very concept of computer-based audio and video\nediting systems to the music and f ilm indus tries.\nASK THE DRI TO WHITEBOARD IT FOR YOU\nIn my experience at a certain fruit-named company, each of our software application releases typically\ninvolved dozens of new features and enhancements. For each launch, it was the PM\u2019s job to cull the\ncomplete list down to a half dozen or so top-level features (TLF) which represented the story of that\nparticular release. It was the responsibility of the PM to present the TLF to the broader marketing team,\nwhich included creative directors, copywriters, graphic designers, etc. It was absolutely essential that the\nmessage be clear, concise, and delivered with enthusiasm. Tell the story right, with clarity and passion,\nand the entire creative team would get engaged to do their very best work to help you showcase the\nproduct. Were the message to lack cohesion or come off as uninspired, the creative team could just as\neasily disengage, performing mediocre work at best, which would invariably result in the industry giving it\na collective yawn. The quickest way for a PM to lose the respect of engineering is to make the product", "sound boring or obscure. Conversely, one of the best ways for a PM to earn kudos from other teams is to\ntell the story in an articulate, engaging, and insightful manner.\nSo how exactly do you figure out how to succinctly and effectively communicate the solution that will\nmake the customer awesome? Simple: for each and every TLF ask the engineer or scientist most directly\nresponsible for that particular bit to explain it to you in detail, in layman\u2019s terms. The process requires you\nto search out the directly responsible individual (DRI) for that exact feature or technology. In some\ncases, particularly with small start-ups, it may the founder. Often it\u2019s the product\u2019s chief architect who\ndirects the engineering team. In a Fortune 100 company, it might well be a shy but brilliant scientist who\nworks within one tiny team among a vast R&D organization. What I can assure you is, it isn\u2019t someone\nwho is somewhat close to the feature but not directly involved. Rather, it must be the DRI, the person\nwho coded, engineered, designed, or directed the work that led to that particular feature. At Sonic\nSolutions it was Dr. Andy Moorer, at Apple it was usually Randy Ubillos, and at DxO it is often Dr.\nFr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Guichard.\nWhen you take the time to identify the precise DRI for that specific feature or technology, you\u2019ll\ndiscover that that person, and only that person, is capable of explaining it to you, in depth and with more\nclarity than you could possibly imagine. Most important, you will have the opportunity to feel firsthand\ntheir personal passion for the product, and gain a better understanding of the true benefit of the solution\nas they originally conceived of it. In my experience this process typically involved either a private one-on-\none session, or a very select gathering, but never a large group. And in my experience it always, always\ninvolved a whiteboard, because I\u2019ve never met an engineer or scientist who wasn\u2019t keen to express\nthemselves with an erasable marker. After listening carefully to their description of the feature or\ntechnology, it\u2019s essential for you to try to immediately channel their voice and repeat what you\u2019ve just\nlearned, as in, \u201cso, would I be correct in describing this as\u2026?\u201d The process, which involves focused\nlistening and detailed note-taking, may well require several interactions before you are in complete\nharmony with the DRI and are able to perfectly articulate, in layman\u2019s terms, the solution. Follow this tip\nand you as the PM will be properly equipped to tell a great story to the creative marketing team, who will\nhelp you share your message with the industry, media, channel partners, and your soon-to-be awesome\ncustomers.", "Congratulations! You\u2019ve successfully shipped your product! Everything\u2019s\ndone, right? Well, you need to do three more things during this cycle: PARTY,\nself-assess the cycle, and create a recommendation for the next iteration.\nLet\u2019s look at these three in detail.\nCELEBRATE!\nIt\u2019s really important for team and company morale to celebrate even small\nwins. For instance, you might celebrate fixing a difficult bug by getting\ncupcakes (make sure to take dietary requirements like gluten/sugar-free into\naccount.) When you ship a major version of your product, you might take the", "core team out for a nice dinner. And when you ship something big, you might\nhelp organize a companywide celebration.\nThese celebrations provide a way for individual contributors to get\nrecognized for their work. Product managers are often the most visible\nrepresentatives for their products, even though they\u2019re not the ones designing\nit or doing the coding. It\u2019s important to give credit to the team for doing a\ngreat job so that each person feels important and like a part of something\nbigger. It\u2019s also a great way to build respect between you and the team\u2014on e\nof the easiest ways to lose your team\u2019s respect is to take credit for the team\u2019s\nwork.\nIf you\u2019re organizing a companywide celebration, as a PM you\u2019ll likely give\na quick speech. This is a great oppor tunity to recognize the core team,\nspecific others who have gone above  and beyond to help get the product\nlaunched, and any groups that contributed to it beyond the product\u2019s core\nteam. It\u2019s also really nice to have positive feedback from internal people\n(what\u2019d the CEO think?) and external people (press quotes, customer emails)\nto share. This feedback is extra validation that the team\u2019s work is being well\nreceived. If a launch wasn\u2019t well received, you should still recognize the\neffort that went into it, as you want the team to have a positive attitude when\nworking on the next iteration of the product.\nOrganizing small activities and celebrations while building the product can\nalso be very helpful for team morale. When the team hits a key milestone, you\nmight go on an outing to play mini-golf.\nIt will likely fall to you to organize these celebrations\u2014though your office\nmanager/HR team can help with companywide ones. Make sure to be\ncognizant of the importance of these celebrations, as it\u2019s easy to forget about\nthem with all the other things on a product manager\u2019s plate.", "ASSESS HOW THINGS WENT\nUltimately what matters most to the company is what your customers think of\nthe product and if you achieve your success metrics, but it\u2019s important to look\nat how you got to the release. If you alienated everyone or made the product\nextremely hard to build, the people on your team likely won\u2019t want to work\non the next version and might even look for different jobs. Assessing how\nthings went ensures that you gather feedback, letting people feel their\nconcerns are heard, and think about how to do be tter in the next cycle.\nFor some people, assessing how things went during the development cycle\nis very difficult, personally. This is when you explicitly put yourself out there\nand ask for feedback, and you will get feedback, both positive and negative.\nDiscussion with Your Lead\nThe first part of getting feedback is to see what your lead thought of your\nwork. Was she happy with how you approached everything, or were there\nthings she\u2019d like you to try doing differently? Did she get positive feedback\nfrom other teams about you, or were other leads always complaining about\nyou? It\u2019s very useful to schedule a one-on-one meeting with your lead, if you\ndon\u2019t have regularly scheduled meetings, to check in and make sure\neverything is good. A way to start the conversation is by asking, \u201cCould you\ngive me feedback on how you feel this cycle went? I want to make sure I\u2019m\ndoing the best job possible.\u201d After all, we grow by working on our weak\nspots.\nTeam Postmortem\nThe other part of assessing how things went is to get the team\u2019s feedback, and\nan effective way to do this is with a postmortem meeting. There are a few", "different ways to run these meetings. We\u2019ll walk you through how to run one\nyourself with the core team. If you feel you had problems working with the\nteam, you might ask someone else to run the postmortem so you can be absent\nfrom the room to make the team feel comfortable speaking openly. Some\ncompanies have open-door postmortems, where anyone in the company can\ndrop in to hear about the process. You\u2019ll just have to pick what feels most\nappropriate for your situation.\nHere\u2019s how we like to run postmortems. Find a time where the product\u2019s\ncore team and the key stakeholders are available, and schedule a meeting for\nan hour or so. You\u2019ll want to try to create a relaxed and open atmosphere,\nwhich can mean anything from book ing the meeting room with the comfy\nchairs to providing food and alcoholic/non-alcoholic drinks for the team\u2014it\nvaries company to company. Just make sure you have a whiteboard or\nsomething to write on that everyone can see.\nSince this meeting is about feedback, all opinions are valid\u2014m ake sure you\ndon\u2019t put value judgments on what people say, especially if they give you\nnegative feedback. Divide the whiteboard into two columns: things you did\nwell, and things you wish went more smoothly. Start by asking everyone to\nsay what they think went well. After a bit, switch to the other list and ask for\nthings people wish had gone better. Bounce back and forth between the lists\nuntil you feel everyone\u2019s been heard.\nLast, take some time to discuss what you want to do differently and what\nyou want to keep the same during the next cycle. You should write down the\npostmortem notes somewhere, like on the product\u2019s wiki page, including the\nkey things you\u2019re committing to doing differently during the next cycle.\nPeriodically refer back to this list to make sure you\u2019re alleviating as much of\nthe process pain as you can while keeping the good t hings.", "RECOMMENDING WHAT\u2019S NEXT\nAfter launch, it\u2019s time to start another iteration of the product-development\nlife cycle. However, there\u2019s a challenge. In an ideal world, you\u2019d have useful\ndata about how what you did during this iteration affected your success\nmetrics and goals. Unfortunately, it usually takes time to gather enough useful\ndata to see whether your changes worked. Your immediate next iteration will\nbe driven by your product roadmap (Chapter 2) and other approaches we\ncovered in Chapter 3. Then, after enough time has passed to gather useful\ndata from this iteration, you\u2019ll put this product into one of three high-level\nbuckets. Specifically, you\u2019ll recommend moving on to something else\nbecause this product/feature is good enough, iterating more on this product,\nor sunsetting this product.\nIf you\u2019ve achieved or surpassed your success-metric goals, then your\nrecommendation will likely be to move on to something else. Automatic\ncrash reporting can be very helpful here for mobile and desktop apps, as you\nmight uncover bugs affecting lots of customers that you want to fix before\nmoving on, even if you hit your success-metric goals.\nIf you\u2019re not hitting your goals, then you need to dig deeper to think about\nwhere and how you want to iterate. Running simple A/B tests with tools like\nOptimizely is a great way to quickly see if you can make any small changes\nto help you achieve your goals. Sometimes non-core-product changes, like\nthe wording on a website, can make a big difference. The marketing team\nwill likely be running a lot of A/B tests on the marketing website to see what\ngets the most customers buying/using your product.\nLooking at what your customers think is also important. Maybe you hit your\nrevenue goals by switching to a subscription payment model, but if your\ncustomers hate it and are looking for alternatives, your long-term success is", "in question. What\u2019s nice about releasing a product into the wild is that you\u2019ll\nsee product reviews, social media posts, and support tickets about the new\nproduct. Look through these, in addition to reviewing your metrics, to see\nwhat customers think.\nWe\u2019d recommend rereading Chapters 3 and 4, thinking about how to come\nup with your next oppor tunity hypothesis for an existing product/feature that\u2019s\nnot achieving its goals. Moove r, for example, might find that customers love\nand use the chat feature, but the company still is not hitting its goals. By\nleveraging the advice in Chapter 3 around asking why, we might conclude we\nhave a platform-growth problem to address next.\nYou might conclude that no reasonable amount of effort will make the\nproduct achieve your success-metric goals. Or maybe your company\u2019s\npriorities have shifted, and this product just doesn\u2019t fit with the overall\nstrategy anymore. Or maybe a technological development has made\nsomething much better for your customers possible, but creating that\n\u201csomething better\u201d will mean a completely different product and not an\nupgrade. In this case, your recommendation should be to end-of-life or\n\u201csunset\u201d the product.\nSunsetting a product simply means you\u2019ll stop doing active development on\nit, and customers should switch to something else. We won\u2019t go into this in\ndepth, but you usually don\u2019t just suddenly stop selling a product. It\u2019s\nimportant to have a window where customer support is still available for the\nproduct, time where customer data is still available so that customers can\nretrieve it for online products, and ideally a migration path to help customers\nmove to an alternative product. While it can be frustrating for loyal\ncustomers, sunsetting products isn\u2019t a bad thing, and companies do it all the\ntime. The trick is just to make sure you have a reasonable plan in place.", "In March 2013 Google announced it was going to discontinue its Reader\nRSS feed aggregator because fewer and fewer people were using it and the\ncompany wanted to focus on other products. Google gave customers four\nmonths to retrieve and move their data, and they showed customers how to\nuse Google Takeout to retrieve that data.\nIn another example, Apple retired its professional photo-management tool,\nAperture, in mid-2014. The company provided an update to make sure\nAperture worked on the upcoming version of OS X so that customers could\ncontinue to use it for at least another year. Apple also worked with its main\ncompetitor, Adobe , to ensure Adobe \u2019s professional photo-management tool,\nLightroom, had an \u201cImport from Aperture\u201d command to help customers\nmigrate their data.\nUltimately, whatever your recommendation is, this final step of the product-\ndevelopment life cycle feeds nicely into the first step we went over in\nChapter 3: deciding what you should do next. The key difference is that you\nstart by evaluating whether you\u2019re happy with what you just did, whether you\nneed to work on it more, or whether you need to sunset the product so that\nyou can focus on something else. And then you repeat and repeat and repeat.\n________ \nCHAPTER NINE TIP\nOur final tip comes from Carlos Gonz\u00e1lez de Villaumbrosia, founde r and\nCEO of Produc t School. He has dedicated his entire career to bridging the", "gap between education and employment in tech. Carlos was inspired to\ncreate Produc t School based on his own experience when he had to learn\nhow to break into produc t manage ment the hard way.\nAs a good agile PM and lean entrepreneur, Carlos focused on tackling\nthat specific problem and built a very basic MVP to validate his solution.\nProduc t School started as a casual recurring meeting between Carlos and\nseven aspiring produc t manage rs in Starbucks around the Financ ial\nDistrict in San Francisco. In those meetings, Carlos would share his\nexperience and would even invite other PMs as guest speakers to share\ntheirs. The reaction was so positive that Carlos rented a room in a\ncoworking space, created the first version of the produc t manage ment\ncurriculum, taught the first 10 cohor ts to refine every detail related to\ndelighting his students, and make sure they were equipped with the right\ntools and k nowledge to bui ld produc ts and ge t PM jobs.\nIn just two years, Produc t School became the first tech business school in\nthe world. It currently offers produc t manage ment courses in San\nFrancisco, Silicon Valley, Los Angeles, and New York. All of its instructors\nare senior-level PMs at top companies such as Google, Facebook ,\nSnapc hat, Airbnb, P ayPal, American Express, and N etflix.\nThis piece of advice comes from the data and experience gained from\nworking w ith Produc t School\u2019s produc t manage ment students every day.\nHOW TO BREAK INTO PRODUCT MANAGEMENT\nI transitioned into product management from software engineering eight years ago, and I founded\nProduct School to teach others aspiring product managers do the same.\nThe main reason people make a career shift into product management is because they are interested\nin having more decision-making power on the product strategy of the company. I don\u2019t blame them; this\nis a big shift that will impact your long-term upside since you will stop being a specialist in one part of", "the process to become a generalist in all the parts involved in the process by leveraging other people\u2019s\ntalents. This approach will serve you well professionally and personally.\nThroughout my career, I have meet dozens of current product managers, and entrepreneurs and\ninvestors who worked as product managers in the past. They all shared the exact same problem about\nhow they didn\u2019t have proper training when they started their management careers in tech. Yes, it\u2019s true\nthat a lot of them earned MBAs or similar business-related degrees at top universities that provided\ndifferent skillets and access to networks that helped in the long term. But these business degrees aren\u2019t\nalways applicable to product management, nor do they teach you how to be a product manager. In fact,\nmost of today\u2019s product managers, whether they have MBAs or computer science degrees, had to learn\ntheir craft on the go because there wasn\u2019t any product management school that had a holistic view,\nincorporating business, engineering, and design, Fortunately, Product School fills that gap.\nHere are some examples of different career paths to break into product management. Keep in mind\nthat this list isn\u2019t complete:\nEngineer \u2192 Senior engineer \u2192 \nTechnical project or program manager/engineering manager \u2192 Product manager\nStartup founder \u2194 Product manager\nManagement consultant/investment banker \u2192 Product manager\nCustomer support \u2192 \nBusiness analyst/project manager or program manager \u2192 \nProduct manager\nMarketing \u2192 Product marketing \u2192 Product manager\nDesign \u2192 Product design \u2192 Product manager\nThe one thing all of these career paths have in common is that PMs don\u2019t start as PMs. They spend at\nleast a few years in a different role, develop a few key skills, and then transition into product. The three\ncritical skills I think you have to develop in order to get a job as a product manager are technical\nexpertise, domain expertise, and communication expertise. Let\u2019s look at these three.\nAs you\u2019ve learned from the previous chapters, even if you don\u2019t know how to code, it\u2019s critical for", "product managers to understand some of the engineering behind the products they\u2019re managing. This\nknowledge will help you communicate with designers and engineers, assess technical feasibility, and\nunderstand what the technical side of implementing a project.\nNext, especially for your first product management job, it\u2019s important to understand the domain you\u2019re\nworking within. As we discussed in Chapter 1, we\u2019ve found that when you get your first PM job, if you\nknow about the field you\u2019re working in, you will be able to spend your time focusing on how to be a\nproduct manager rather than learning the nuances, challenges, competitive landscape, and more of your\ndomain.\nFinally, something we don\u2019t cover in detail in this book is how critical great communication skills are to\nPMs. PMs have to communicate all the time, whether via email or presentation. In our Product School\nbootcamps, we spend multiple hours teaching students how to be great public speakers with plenty of\npractice. If you can\u2019t communicate, it doesn\u2019t matter how great of a PM you are because no one can\nunderstand you.\nBeyond Product School, there are a few specific things that will help you transition into product\nmanagement:\nBuild something. In class, our students work towards a final capstone project where they pick a\ncompany they\u2019d be qualified to work at, determine what feature that company should build next, and\ncreate a presentation explaining why the company should build it next and the key requirements. Try\ndoing this on your own! If you know how to code, take a project from start to finish so that you can\nexperience shipping a product and getting feedback from customers.\nAttend hackathons. Check out product hackathons such as ProtoHack or StartupWeekend to get\nhands-on experience building a product in high-pressure environments.\nFind a mentor. Reach out to PMs you respect and who you feel could be good mentors to you.\nProduct School has an active Slack community, product-school, which is a great place to find a mentor.\nA mentor can provide war stories and help you understand best practices.\nNetwork. Check out product events in your city. Websites like Meetup and Eventbrite often feature\nevents. These events can be a great place to find a mentor, too.\nRead. The Further Reading list at the back of this book has great resources to help you learn more\nabout being a PM. We\u2019d highly recommend you check out Cracking the PM Interview by Gayle\nLaakmann McDowell or Decode and Conquer by Lewis C. Lin to understand what PM interviews\ninvolve.", "Apply to associate product manager (APM) programs. Some big tech companies such as\nGoogle, Yahoo, and Facebook have entry-level APM roles for new college graduates, where they teach\nyou how to be a PM on the job. You might qualify to apply.\nOne of the most common mistakes in landing your first PM job is setting your expectations too high,\neither in terms of your title or your company. Just because you are a senior software engineer now does\nnot mean your first PM job will be as a senior product manager. Similarly, your current company might\nnot be your dream company, but if there\u2019s an opening for a PM, you likely have a better chance landing\nthat as your first PM job than getting a job elsewhere.\nBe realistic! Asses your current expertise and map out realistic career paths inside or outside your\ncurrent company. Your ideal PM job will likely not be your first PM job, but that\u2019s OK.

In this case,\nthose painfully frustrating words are from Ken Norton, partner at Google\nVentures, in a blog post titled \u201cHow to Hire a Product Manager.\u201d Think about\na company for a second. Engineers build the product. Designers make sure it\nhas a great user experience and looks good. Marketing makes sure customers\nknow about the product. Sales gets potential customers to open their wallets\nto buy the product. What more does a company need? Where does a product\nmanager fit into that mix?\nThose simple questions are what cause not only the confusion, but also the", "oppor tunity that comes with product management. Heck, if you\u2019re\ntransitioning into product management, these questions might make you worry\nthat product managers are irrelevant. And if you are currently a product\nmanager, you might feel a sudden need to justify your existence. Truthfully,\nwithout a product manager a company will continue to operate pretty well\u2014\nto a point. Yet with a strong product manager a company can become great.<<<SECTION_BREAK>>>\nWHAT DO PRODUCT MANAGERS DO?\nPut simply, a product manager (PM) represents the customer No one buys a\nproduct because they want to give the company money. Customers buy and\nuse products because the products address their needs. Done properly, the\nproducts let the customers be awesome. The end result of representing the\ncustomer is that a PM helps the customer be awesome.\nThere\u2019s a lot behind this simple definition, though. Adam Nash, CEO of\nWealthfront and former VP of product at LinkedIn, summed up product\nmanagement by saying, PMs figure out what game a company is playing, and\nhow it keeps score (hint: it\u2019s not always about how much money the company\nmakes).\nDay to day, PMs must understand both business strategy and execution.\nThey must first figure out who the customers are and what problems the\ncustomers have. They must know how to set a vision, finding the right\noppor tunities in a sea of possibilities, by using both data and intuition. They\nmust know how to define success, for the customer and the product, by\nprioritizing doing what is right over doing what is easy. They must know how\nto work with engineers and designers to get the right product built, keeping it\nas simple as possible. They must know how to work with marketing to\nexplain to the customer how the product fills the customer\u2019s need better than", "a competitor\u2019s product. They must do whatever\u2019s needed to help ship the\nproduct, finding solutions rather than excuses. Sometimes, this even means a\nPM getting coffee for a team that\u2019s working long hours to show appreciation.\nBy the way, PMs manage products, not people, so they must achieve\neverything using soft influence, effective communication, leadership, and\ntrust\u2014not orders.\nEven though it\u2019s not always obvious what PMs do from the outside, they\ngenuinely do a  lot! PMs do s o much that they\u2019re sometimes even called \u201cMini\nCEOs.\u201d\nIronically, the thing a PM does the most is say \u201cno.\u201d Some people believe\nthat product managers just dictate what features to build. Given everyone has\nlots of ideas for features, why bother with a PM? It\u2019s true that everyone has\nlots of ideas, some of them good, but most ideas people have are for things\nthey want, not necessarily things customers want. For example, think of an\nengineer who spends her days using cryptic command-line tools\u2014I\u2019m sure\nyou know someone like this! This engineer probably prefers keyboard\nshortcuts, dislikes GUIs, and favors using code to explicitly specify meaning.\nNow, imagine that engineer is part of a team working on an iPad word\nprocessor for senior citizens. Do you think the features the engineer would\nprioritize match what the customers need? A large part of a PM\u2019s job is to\nfigure out the small number of key features to prioritize for the customer, and\nto lay the groundwork for long-term business viability by gracefully saying\n\u201cno\u201d to the numerous requests that don\u2019t fit the customer\u2019s needs.<<<SECTION_BREAK>>>\nSimilar but Different\nIt\u2019s also worth looking at roles that are related to, but different from, product\nmanagement. These jobs get confused with product management because in", "some companies a product manager will also handle these roles\u2019\nresponsibilities, even though they aren\u2019t the product manager\u2019s primary\nstrengths. For example, remember how we said a good PM would do\nwhatever it took to ship the product? Further confusing things, all of these\nrelated roles are abbreviated \u201cPM.\u201d\nProject manage rs are most often confused with product managers. While\nthere are many subtle differences, they can be summed up by saying that a\nproject manager owns the schedule and helps ensure the team is on track to\nmeet any deadlines. The project manager will often work with the product\nmanager, and a product manager will provide input on the schedule. Project\nmanagers are masters of schedules and Gantt charts, not of representing\ncustomers.\nProgram manage rs are usually a bit more similar to product managers, but\nprogram managers generally focus more on the \u201cgetting it built\u201d side,\nworking closely with Engineering and Operations. If you\u2019re building a\nwearable, for example, the program manager will likely be in touch with the\nmanufacturing facility frequently, whereas a product manager will have\nlimited direct interaction with them. Program managers tend to be masters of\nexecution, sort of like a \u201csuper\u201d project manager.\nTo further confuse things, the title that describes what a product manager\ndoes varies slightly from company to company. Microsoft, for example, calls\nits product managers \u201cProgram Managers.\u201d Apple generally splits the\nproduct manager role into the \u201cEngineering Program Manager\u201d (EPM), and\nthe \u201cProduct Marketing Manager\u201d (PMM), with the PMM being closer to our\ndefinition a product manager, and the EPM being closer to a project manager.\nProduct managers are like the conductor in an orchestra. The conductor\nnever makes a sound but is responsible for making the orchestra as a whole", "sound awesome to deliver a great performance to the audience. Great\nconductors understand and engage with everyone in the orchestra, using the\nright vocabulary with each section, diplomatically moving everyone together\ntoward the shared goal of a great performance.\nProject managers help keep all the rehearsals organized so that the\norchestra will be prepared for the concerts. Program managers are involved\nin planning the entire season\u2019s schedule for the concert hall, setting things up\nso that the project managers can make each performance successful.<<<SECTION_BREAK>>>\nBECOMING A PM\nThere\u2019s no obvious path to becoming a product manager. And if you\u2019re\nreviewing r\u00e9sum\u00e9s for potential PM hires, especially if you\u2019re a start-up\nfounder, it\u2019s not obvious what to look for. Most careers have a very clear-cut\npath\u2014you go to school, study computer science, and then you\u2019re set to\nbecome an engineer. Product management isn\u2019t one of those careers.\nBecause product management is a relatively new discipline, it has a much\nless formalized training process than other careers. Given that the role often\ncomes down to \u201cdoing whatever it takes to ship a product that customers will\nlove and that achieves business goals,\u201d product managers should be smart,\ntalented people who can figure things out on their own.\nBeyond that, product managers commonly have an intersection of a\ntechnical background\u2014n ot just engineering\u2014such as industry expertise, and\ncommunication skills. The most common type of product manager is someone\nwith an engineering/computer science background who became interested in\nbusiness. PMs often start out as individually contributing engineers who then\nfind themselves taking on more responsibilities: conducting customer\ninterviews, working with Design to validate ideas, and possibly even", "collaborating with marketing to make sure what they\u2019re working on aligns\nwith customer needs. They\u2019re not necessarily the best coders or the most\ndefinitive domain experts, but their mix of skills makes them unique.\nSometimes PMs come from Design, Marketing, or even business school!\nAt Product School, we often talk about the Product Triangle (Figure 1-1).\nThis is a simple way to visualize and understand where product management\n(ideally) sits in relation to other core departments: Engineering (product\ndevelopment), Design, and Marketing. This diagram is helpful for two\nreasons. First, it visually emphasizes that product management is a generalist\nrole and PMs need to be able to work with significantly different domains.\nSecond, as you go through the process of building a product, you will shift\nyour balance to different parts of the triangle\u2014more on this shortly. Thinking\nabout which leg of the triangle you\u2019re focusing on will let you think about the\nright way to communicate\u2014you\u2019ll talk with Design differently than you do\nEngineering\u2014and the right goals to set during each phase.", "Figure 1-1. The Product Triangle, showing product management at the intersection of three core\ndomains.\nA common question about becoming a PM is, how technical do PMs have to\nbe? They need to know enough that they can work effectively with engineers,\nparticipating in things like bug prioritization and scoping meetings, but they\ndon\u2019t need a computer science or electrical engineering degree. Especially\nfor software PMs, knowing how to code even a little will be beneficial, and\nif you want to become a PM but don\u2019t know how to code, we\u2019d highly\nrecommend learning the basics. Fortunately, there are plenty of resources to\nhelp you learn\u2014you can enroll in a boot camp like Code School or Hack\nReactor or take an online course from lynda.c om or Udemy.\nA big benefit to learning to code is that PMs frequently rely on a way of\nthinking common to coding\u2014top-down design and bottom-up\nimplementation. This means that you think about the big picture, break it", "down into small pieces, and then build those small pieces first. After\nbuilding the small pieces, you combine them to get the big picture. Learning\nto code will give you consistent practice thinking this way.\nAnother common question is, how business-oriented do PMs have to be?\nPMs don\u2019t need an MBA\u2014in fact, some tech companies prefer not to hire\nMBAs\u2014nor do they need a sales background. They should understand the\nindustry of the company they\u2019re interested in and be able to answer the\nfollowing questions: Who are the customers? Who are the major players?\nWhat differentiates one company from another? How do the businesses make\nmoney? PMs should also understand basic financial concepts such as revenue\nvs. profit\u2014revenue is how much money a company takes in, and profit is\nhow much is left after expenses.\nIn general, when we\u2019re working with people who want to make the\ntransition to being a product manager, we recommend they start with an\nindustry/company they\u2019re already very familiar with. That makes for an\neasier transition because they likely know the answers to many of the\nquestions above , even if they don\u2019t explicitly realize it! After you have a few\nyears of product management experience, it\u2019s fairly easy to switch to a new\ndomain, as you know the right questions to ask to be successful. If you\u2019re a\nfounder looking to build your start-up\u2019s product team, we\u2019d recommend\nfocusing on finding the best product person possible, even if that person isn\u2019t\nfamiliar with your dom ain.<<<SECTION_BREAK>>>\nTypes of Product Managers\nWhile you will often hear people talk about product managers in the general\nsense, you will also hear about specialized product managers. Depending on\nyour background, you might find one of these specializations a more", "appropriate career choice than the general role.\nThe most common specialization is technical produc t manage ment. This\nrefers to a PM who has a strong technical background, and who works on a\ntechnical product. For example, this person might work on a software API\nwhere the end customer is a software developer. Technical PMs won\u2019t be\nwriting the code or performing technical tasks, but they need to understand\nthe details of what goes into those tasks.\nAnother specialization is strategic produc t manage ment. This role is the\ncomplement to a technical PM, and it\u2019s someone who has a strong business-\noriented background.\nOnce in a while, you\u2019ll also see titles linked to specific verticals or tasks,\nsuch as growth produc t manage r or mobile produc t manage r. These roles\nare more focused than the general PM role, and a person in such a role will\nhave a more specific set of skills, such as being an expert in all the different\nthings you can do to grow a product\u2014that is, get more customers using it.<<<SECTION_BREAK>>>\nHOW PRODUCT MANAGERS GET PRODUCTS BUILT\nWhile sometimes it might seem like the CEO imagines a product in the\nshower, and then tells the engineering team to build it, any one who has been\na CEO knows this is not the case. Product management is similarly\nmisunderstood by the general public. On TV you\u2019re likely to see the guy get\nout of the shower and start hacking on a laptop with bright green text,\noccasionally solving a hard problem by drawing on glass. The real world\ndoesn\u2019t work like that. So, how do products get built? What does a product\nmanager really do, a nd how?\nIn reality, products continuously undergo a product-development life cycle,\nand a product manager shepherds the product through each phase, owning", "some phases and contributing to others. The product-development life cycle\ninvolves discrete steps, and each step emphasizes a different leg of the\nProduct Triangle.\nWhile the steps are well defined, there are multiple approaches to how\nthese steps can be implemented. On one end of the spectrum there\u2019s the lean\napproach, based on Toyota\u2019s manufacturing methods and adapted to\nsoftware/product development by Steve Blank and Eric Ries. The lean\nmethodology focuses on very fast, iterative cycles where your goal is to\nmake something small, release it, learn from it, and use that knowledge to\nfigure out what to do next. Lean cycles might happen in just a few days. On\nthe oppos ite end of the spectrum you have the waterfall approach, where you\nbuild something big in a very linear fashion\u2014you spend a lot of time\nplanning a product, and once you\u2019ve decided what to do, that\u2019s what you\u2019re\ngoing to build and ship even if it takes a long time. The product moves\nthrough each process step by step and, like a waterfall, things flow one way,\nand\u2014a lmost\u2014never change once they\u2019re defined it. Waterfall cycles might\ntake a year or more.\nFor software product development, larger and older companies tend to use\na waterfall approach, whereas many start-ups use a lean approach. As you\nmight expect intuitively\u2014and there have been many studies to back this up\u2014\nbuilding products with a lean approach is more successful because you\u2019re\nnot risking everything on a potentially long, slow-to-create project. Instead,\nyou risk a little bit to build something small, learn from it, and iterate. For\nthat reason, even larger and older companies are shifting towards a lean\napproach, moving away from waterfall.\nThe most common approach you\u2019ll encounter is a hybrid of waterfall and\nlean where the PM will plan a bit upfront to find the right opportunity, but", "then the teams will implement the product in an iterative way. This is nice\nbecause it lets you keep a big-picture goal in mind, but change course if\nneeded such as if you find a significant technical obstacle or find that\ncustomers don\u2019t want the product you\u2019re building. We\u2019ll mainly focus on a\nhybrid approach in this book .\nHardware product development takes a more waterfall approach because\nit\u2019s harder to change things you\u2019re physically building. For example,\nhardware requires a lot more planning up front, and the iterative cycles\nduring development to get new hardware builds are a lot longer than with\nsoftware. However, the overall principles for building products are very\nsimilar to those for software, and the process is similar enough that the life\ncycle stages we\u2019ll teach you about apply for both hardware and software\nproduct management.\nIn future chapters we\u2019ll dig into each stage of the product-development life\ncycle in depth. For now, let\u2019s look at an overview of each stage, starting with\nthe planning phase.<<<SECTION_BREAK>>>\nTHE PRODUCT-DEVELOPMENT LIFE CYCLE\nEvery product goes through five key conceptual stages:\n1. Finding and planning the right oppor tunity\n2. Designing the solution\n3. Building the solution\n4. Sharing the solution\n5. Assessing the solution\nPut another way, this process involves figuring out what problem to work on,\nfiguring out how to solve it, building the solution, getting it in customers\u2019", "hands, and seeing if it worked for them. Sounds easy, right? Conceptually, it\nis! The devil\u2019s in the details. To help you see how each stage connects,\nbefore we dive deep, let\u2019s look at a high-level overview of each stage.<<<SECTION_BREAK>>>\nFinding and Planning the Right Opportunity\nThe very first phase of the product-development life cycle is to find and\nclearly define the next oppor tunity to pursue. The world\u2019s a sea of\npossibilities! What should you build next? Usually, it\u2019s up to the product\nmanager to create and sort through all the possibilities, picking the right one\nto focus on next.\nThis phase is a critical part of your job. Unlike the other phases, where\nother disciplines take the lead, this phase is where product leads, taking input\nfrom other disciplines. It\u2019s probably the most different from anything\nexpected in another position. Because this is so core to your job, we\u2019ll cover\nfinding the right oppor tunity in extreme depth, breaking it down into three\nparts: strategically understanding a company (Chapter 2), creating an\noppor tunity hypothesis (Chapter 3), and validating that hypothesis (Chapter\n4).\nTo a product manager, strategically understanding a company involves\nlearning about aspects of the company that contribute to its product success\nincluding its target customers, its expertise, its competitive landscape, and\nmore. Understanding these aspects, which we sometimes refer to as a\ncompany\u2019s context, will help you make the right product decisions, and start\nto find focus in the sea of possibilities. A simple example is CNN.com\u2019s\nteam. They are great at building software products\u2014including a website and\nmobile apps\u2014that deliver the news quickly and efficiently to their\ncustomers. Because their PMs know they have software and not hardware", "expertise, they are\u2014probably\u2014not encouraging CNN.com to build a news-\nfocused smart watch, or other hardware product.\nClearly identifying the company\u2019s goals, another strategic element, will\nhelp you narrow down and prioritize the possibilities. At a high level,\ncompany goals fall into three categories: growth, revenue, and customer\nsatisfaction. Specifically, does the company want to get more users for the\nproduct, increase its revenue from the current customers, or make its current\ncustomers happier? If the goal is revenue, how does the company currently\nmonetize their product, and how can you increase the value for customers to\nmake them more willing to pay for the product? If the goal is growth, what\u2019s\nstopping new customers from using the product? If the goal is to delight their\ncustomers, what can you deliver that they would love, but wouldn\u2019t expect?\nBy understanding the current goals you can think strategically, and make sure\nthe products you\u2019re building align with those goals, helping the company be\nsuccessful.\nIn addition to these, there are some other strategic company context\nquestions you should know the answer to: What is the company building\nnow? What does it excel at compared to its competitors? Who are the key\ncustomers you aim to solve a problem for? What\u2019s the company\u2019s vision, and\n\u2014more fundamentally\u2014why does the company exist?\nWith the company\u2019s context in mind, the next step, which we\u2019ll cover in\nChapter 3, is to create an oppor tunity hypothesis. What do you believe is the\nright thing to work on next? It could be something as small as fixing a bug\nthat\u2019s been in your backlog for a while, or something as large as building an\nentirely new product.\nThese opportunity hypotheses come from many different places. Looking at\nhow existing customers use your product is a common source of new", "oppor tunities, allowing you to find ways to better serve your customers\u2014and\nyour company\u2019s goals. A metric is a measurement of a task a customer does\nwith your product. Collectively, your metrics can provide some great insight!\nFrom metrics, you might find an oppor tunity, such as wanting to get higher\nengagement with a component of your product.\nFor example, CNN.com likely keeps track of what headlines visitors click\non, how many people start watching each video, how many finish watching\neach video, how many scroll down and read each article, and more. They\nmight then use this data to pull out conclusions, such as, \u201cWe should\nprioritize video content instead of text because people tend to watch videos\nto completion and see each ad, whereas very few people read articles to\ncompletion.\u201d\nAfter thinking about the company\u2019s context and goals, talking with users,\nanalyzing usage data, looking at existing bug reports and feature requests, and\nusing other approaches we\u2019ll cover in Chapter 3, you\u2019ll have an idea about\nwhat to do next. But before you start to build a feature, you should do some\ntype of validation work to ensure this is the right oppor tunity to pursue, and\nthat it actually will help you achieve your goals. You have limited time and\nresources, and spending a little bit of time validating an oppor tunity\nhypothesis can often save you significant time and money by keeping you\nfocused on the best oppor tunities. Chapter 4 goes into depth about how to\nvalidate an idea.\nOnce you\u2019ve validated your idea, you\u2019ll need to develop it into something\nyour teams can implement. An important part of the product-planning phase\nin the product-development life cycle is scoping the oppor tunity. Scoping\nmeans clearly defining the oppo rtunity and the customers you want to target,\nalong with the requirements for the solution. If you\u2019re building a pen, do you", "need it to work in space? Underwater? Upside down? You\u2019ll want to clearly\ndefine these situations to help everyone understand what the product will\nneed to do w hen it\u2019s finished.\nWhen working in lean or hybrid environments, you\u2019ll often hear the phrase\nminimum viable produc t (MVP). This is a term from lean methodology that\nsimply means, \u201cWhat\u2019s the most minimally featured thing you can build that\nwill address the oppor tunity well for most of your target customers and\nvalidate your oppor tunity?\u201d In other words, if you were to think about the\ncore function you\u2019re trying to let customers accomplish, what\u2019s the simplest\nproduct you can build that lets them achieve that goal?\nContinuing our CNN example, if you went back in time and were working\non the first version of CNN\u2019s mobile app, what\u2019s the simplest app you could\nbuild that would provide value to your customers? It might be something with\na list of news headlines and a refresh button, and when you tap on each, you\nsee the video for the story. Again, the key to identifying the MVP is that\nyou\u2019re focused on the core functionality it provides to the user\u2014news, in this\ncase\u2014rather than focusing on all the possible features you might build in\naddition to that core function.\nIdentifying the MVP is a key part of scoping a product because it helps you\nidentify the most important thing to build first\u2014we\u2019ll cover tips on how to\ndo that in Chapter 5. This lets you focus your design and development efforts\nto create a\u2014hopefully\u2014useful product that you can deliver to customers\nquickly, whether as shipped software or software tested in house. Testing the\nMVP with real customers will help you figure out what other features will be\nin and out of scope, as you quickly will get real feedback about what\ncustomers like and don \u2019t like.\nNote that an MVP doesn\u2019t mean the product is bad or poorly built. In fact,", "quite the oppos ite\u2014it should be very good a t what it does, but it should focus\non doing only a few key tasks.\nContrast this with non-MVP-based approaches to product development,\nwhich are especially common in waterfall development. In that world, you\nend up spending lots of time trying to build the \u201cperfect\u201d product with every\nfeature you can imagine, it takes forever to build, and once it\u2019s out in the real\nworld you discover that customers don\u2019t use half the features you thought they\nwould.\nA key differentiator between lean and waterfall is that lean leverages\nMVPs. With a lean approach, you build the simplest thing you can, gather\ndata about how customers use it, and then refine the product if needed. This\nwill let you work quite effectively, building only the features customers want\nand will use rather than wasting time building things customers don\u2019t care\nabout.\nSpending lots of time iterating internally and building features without\nreleasing a product can be quite harmful to your business. With our\nhypothetical CNN app example, if we didn\u2019t take an MVP-based approach,\nwe might decide to replicate the website completely, including features like\ncomments, user-submitted video, and customized news streams. Building all\nthose features could delay our launch by months, and who knows how much\nof our customer base would use those features on their phones. Yes, we could\nuse metrics from the website to prioritize these features, but hopefully you\nget the point. Additionally, while we were taking lots of time and building\nfeatures for our unreleased app, our customers wanted a mobile news app\nand turned to Fox News or another competitor that built its app using an\nMVP-based approach. The customers cared about the core function\u2014getting\nnews on the go\u2014n ot about all the extra features. And it\u2019s hard to get", "customers back after they\u2019ve turned to a competitor!\nMost companies using a hybrid model never build a true MVP, but rather an\nMVP with some extra key features they believe will make the product more\nenticing. If you know for certain customers will want those key features,\nincorporating them from the start will help shorten the iteration cycle.\nTo be fair, hardware development often requires you to try to build more\nthan an MVP because releasing a hardware update is much more complex\nthan a software update. But keeping the MVP in mind, even with hardware,\nwill help you prioritize your development efforts.\nSometimes, as we\u2019ll discuss in Chapter 4, your very first MVP will be\nhuman-powered rather than automated. For example, if you\u2019re a PM at Yelp\nand want to add a restaurant-recommendation feature, eventually you\u2019ll\ncreate a fully automated algorithm to generate recommendations. But you\ncould build an initial MVP that makes it appear that the user is getting\nautomated recommendations when it actually has a human making and\nsending these lists. If many people like and use this feature, then great, you\u2019ll\nbuild the automation engine. If no one uses it, then this very lightweight MVP\nsaved you the time and effort of building the full feature.\nJust as important as scoping the problem is defining your success metrics.\nWhat are your goals with the product, and how do you keep score to see if\nyou\u2019re achieving them?\nGoing back to CNN.com, its ultimate goal might be to become the place\npeople go to for news. This means its success metrics include the number of\nviews on a piece of content, the percentage of people who consume each\npiece of content, the number of articles read or videos watched in a session,\nand how often the person comes back to CNN.com. The reason we don\u2019t\nsolely use page views on a piece of content is because a person might click", "on an article but never read it. That means that person is not actually getting\nnews/consuming content from CNN.com.\nProduct managers create a document that encompasses the entire planning\nphase, called a produc t requirements document (PRD), collecting all this\nplanning information in one spot. A PRD contains the explanation for why\nyou\u2019re pursuing this oppor tunity, the scoped problem definition, the success\nmetrics, and more. But you don\u2019t create the PRD in isolation\u2014you\u2019ll work\nwith your team, your boss, and other product stakeholders to make sure the\noppor tunity and requirements are clear and the goals are achievable.\nOne of the biggest reasons that other stakeholders, such as design and\nengineering leads, are involved in the PRD is that it will be up to them\u2014not\nthe product manager\u2014to figure out the right solution for this oppor tunity.\nAfter all, the design and engineering teams are the experts in their domains,\nand the product manager is not, even if she started her career in one of those\ndomains!\nPRDs gained a bad reputation from waterfall development because they\nwere huge dictating documents that people disliked reading. In fact, the lean\nmodel largely doesn\u2019t use PRDs. In the hybrid model, the PRD is treated as a\ngreat communications tool to get everyone on the same page and as a living\n\u2014not dictating\u2014doc ument. Over the product-development life cycle, the\nPRD will expand to contain more information, but it starts by clearly stating\nthe problem and why we\u2019re working on it. When the product\u2019s built, the PRD\nprovides a great reference for the sales and support teams to understand\nwhat\u2019s in the product and why. We\u2019ll go over how to effectively write and\nuse a PRD in Chapter 5.\nOnce we have this first draft of a PRD\u2014clearly identifying the\noppor tunity/problem and success metrics\u2014and all stakeholders have agreed", "on the right problem to focus on next, we\u2019ll move on to the next phase of the\nproduct-development life cycle.<<<SECTION_BREAK>>>\nDesigning the Solution\nDuring this phase, covered in depth in Chapter 6, we\u2019ll figure out a feasible\nsolution to the problem we\u2019ve identified.\nHere, PMs will primarily work with the design team, but the engineering\nteam will offer input as well, to help gauge feasibility. For example, a\nCNN.com PM might have found that her readers complete a lot more articles\nwhen a virtual reality 360\u00b0  video is included, meaning better success\nmetrics, and the PM wants to integrate 360\u00b0  videos into more content. The\ndesign team might then create designs where every breaking news story has a\nlive-streaming 360\u00b0 video to put viewers right there with the reporter, but the\nengineering team might not be able to build a live-streaming solution. This\nmeans the design team needs to come up with another solution that the\nengineering team can implement.\nEven though the PM won\u2019t be coming up with the solution herself, she\u2019ll\nstay actively involved in this phase. She\u2019ll likely work closely with design to\nconduct user research, looking at people\u2019s current behavior. She\u2019ll also help\ncommunicate with Engineering to ensure Design isn\u2019t working in isolation\u2014\nthat everyone is working together to solve the customer\u2019s problems.\nContrary to popu lar belief, design doesn\u2019t just mean what the solution looks\nlike. Design involves aspects like information architecture (In what order are\nthings presented to the user?), wireframes (Where should the information live\non the screen?), and pixels (How does it look?). It\u2019s uncommon to find a\ndesigner who\u2019s an expert on every one of these aspects, and a PM will likely\nbe working with a design team rather than with just one designer to figure out", "how the product should function and look.\nIf possible, you\u2019ll want the design team to produce prototypes of the\nsolutions that they can test with customers to validate the design. These\nprototypes could be printouts that you swap in when the customer clicks on\nsomething, clickable mockups working with fake data, etc. The key is to have\nsomething that accurately represents the solution, but that you can mock up\nwithout having to actually build the solution.\nDesign is done when you have validated a prototype as a suitable solution,\nEngineering has agreed to the viability of the solution, and you\u2019ve defined the\nlook and feel of the solution that all stakeholders have agreed to.<<<SECTION_BREAK>>>\nBuilding the Solution\nOnce you\u2019ve defined the problem and designed a solution, it\u2019s time to build\nit.\nCompanies have different approaches to implementing solutions, depending\non their history, the product, and their desires. For example, if you\u2019re\nworking on a mobile app, it\u2019s very easy to release a new version to\ncustomers every week, and development is likely focused on smaller but\nmore frequent releases\u2014lean development is very common with mobile and\nweb apps. If you\u2019re building hardware, there is a long time between the\nproduct\u2019s design and when its hardware is ready for mass production.\nHardware-engineering companies generally have fewer but very high-quality\nreleases. After all, it\u2019s difficult to release a hardware update to fix a bug!\nIn Chapter 7, we\u2019ll cover some of the most common software-development\nmethodologies, along with tips for working with engineers. Suffice it to say\nthe PM will stay involved throughout development, helping to prioritize bugs\n(backlog grooming), test software, and do whatever\u2019s needed to help the", "product ship.\nA note of caution if you\u2019re currently an engineer who wants to transition to\nproduct management\u2014de velopment might turn out to be the most frustrating\nphase to you because you are not an engineer anymore. You will not be\nwriting code for the product, or telling people what code to write. Your job\nis to stand aside, and let the people who are still engineers write the code.\nYou help them however else you can, even if it\u2019s getting them coffee, but\ndon\u2019t tell them what to do u nless they ask for your help.\nFurthermore, as a PM, you\u2019ll be put into positions where you have to\nnegotiate taking on technical debt, meaning you need to ask Engineering to\nwrite kludgey code that isn\u2019t sustainable in the long term to get something\ndone in the short term.\nEngineers hate taking on technical debt\u2014they want to write a complete\nanswer from the outset. If you come from an engineering background, taking\non technical debt can be hard. As a PM, you\u2019ll often have to make hard\ntradeoff decisions, accepting short-term debt to provide customer value\nfaster. The oppos ite is true as well, which is hard for PMs from a non-\ntechnical background. You\u2019ll have to pay off that debt later\u2014cleaning up the\ncode\u2014otherwise the code can get unwieldy, and it can become very hard to\niterate on the project.\nAlso, although we\u2019re presenting the product-development life cycle in a\nvery linear fashion, it\u2019s a lot more iterative in real life, especially between\ndesigning and building the solution. For example, while Design will have\nfigured out the most common use cases in the prototyping stage, there are\nlikely many edge cases that will come up while Engineering\u2019s building the\nproduct. Product, Design, and Engineering will work together to address\nthese needs and questions that arise while working on the product.", "During the development phase a PM should try to find effective\noppor tunities to share prototypes of the product with customers or people\ninside the company, so that you can get early feedback about the product.\nDoes it address the customer\u2019s need effectively, or is there a big tradeoff you\ndidn\u2019t anticipate? If you prioritize building the minimum viable product you\npreviously identified, then you can start testing the core product once the\nMVP\u2019s ready. It\u2019s important to ask for this feedback at the right times\u2014if you\nwait until right before you release to get feedback, you might not have time to\nact on what you learn.\nNew information that affects the product\u2019s scope might come up during\ndevelopment, too. Going back to our example of 360\u00b0  live-streaming on\nCNN.com, maybe a third-party company released a tool that makes it very\neasy to live-stream these videos. That\u2019d make it simple for CNN.com\u2019s\nengineers to add on-the-scene 360\u00b0  video to breaking news stories, which\nwas originally deemed out of scope because of the technical challenge.\nIn the product-development approach we\u2019re presenting in this book , it\u2019s\nalways best to do more investigation up front, so that you don\u2019t waste\nresources designing a solution and then have to change large parts of it. But\nthe best product managers are ones who know they can\u2019t define everything\nperfectly up front, and that it\u2019s generally impractical to spend months trying\nto do so. Instead they do their best to plan, but also seek out new information\nto help the product get better, and react to any needed changes with open\narms.\nThe development phase of the product-development life cycle is done when\na working product that has been thoroughly tested is ready for release.<<<SECTION_BREAK>>>\nSharing the Solution", "As much as we\u2019d like to believe that if we build it, they will come, the world\ndoesn\u2019t work that way. Product marketing (Chapter 8)\u2014in fact, marketing in\ngeneral\u2014is an incredibly important part of the product-development life\ncycle, and really begins after we\u2019ve built the solution. This phase of the life\ncycle is where we launch our product, sharing it with the world and letting\nour customers know how our product will help them.\nEffectively telling the world about our product is so important that some\ncompanies even create a separate position, the produc t marketing manage r.\nA PMM is very similar to a PM, but a PM tends to be more internally\nfocused\u2014g etting the product built\u2014while a PMM is externally focused\u2014\nworking with customers to understand their needs and to communicate the\nproduct\u2019s value.\nEarly in the first stage of the product-development life cycle, even before\nscoping the oppor tunity, it should be clear what this product will do for the\ncustomer. This isn\u2019t a list of what features it has or what the product does,\nbut rather what problem it will solve. In the product marketing phase of the\nproduct-development life cycle, you figure out how to succinctly and\neffectively communicate how the product solves that problem and makes the\ncustomer awesome. It\u2019s essentially storytelling, and we call it \u201cmessaging.\u201d\nFor example, going back to CNN.com\u2019s 360\u00b0  VR video streaming feature, if\nwe promoted the feature itself, \u201cLive 360\u00b0  VR video streaming,\u201d most\ncustomers wouldn\u2019t know what that meant\u2014or care. Instead of talking about\nthe specific feature, we can focus on the value and the benefit this feature\nprovides: \u201cBe on the scene with our reporters.\u201d We might then go on to say\nwhat the feature is and how to use it, but we\u2019ve led with a clear message\nabout why a customer should care.\nThis phase of the product-development life cycle is more than just", "messaging, though. We\u2019ll also plan for the product\u2019s release. Release might\ninvolve planning a beta test, creating marketing assets for a website or ad,\nworking with key partners before release, briefing the press, or planning a\nlaunch event. The exact needs will vary from launch to launch.\nBroadly, this phase of the product-development life cycle is done when the\nproduct is launched, but there will likely be many marketing campaigns and\ntasks to help achieve the product\u2019s success metrics beyond the launch.\nMarketing will continue even while the team, internally, has moved on to the\nnext version of the product, or to a completely different product.<<<SECTION_BREAK>>>\nAssessing the Solution\nThe last phase of the product-development life cycle is to assess how the\njust-completed iteration of the cycle went, see if you\u2019re on track to achieve\nyour success metrics, and come up with a recommendation for what to do in\nthe next iteration. As you might guess, that recommendation feeds into the\ninitial planning phase of the next iteration.\nDuring this phase, you will meet with the team that you built the product\nwith and assess how it went. Did everyone get so burned out that half the\nteam quit? Was the team very happy with the process and excited to work on\nthe next project? What was the team\u2019s overall competitive strength, and what\ncould they improve at? Use this feedback to determine what went well, and\nwhat you should do di fferently the next time around.\nNow that the product\u2019s released, you should start seeing real data about\nhow people are using it. Is it in line with your expectations, or is something\nfar off? And most importantly, does it look like you\u2019re on track to achieve\nyour success metrics? For example, CNN.com could look at how many\npeople are watching its new 360\u00b0  broadcasts and whether the overall number", "of people getting their content from CNN has increased after the release of\nthis new feature. If the number of people watching these broadcasts and\nseeking out more content on CNN improved, then your product was a\nsuccess. If it\u2019s unchanged, then you should evaluate why this strategy didn\u2019t\nwork how you expected\u2014w hy don\u2019t customers like it?\nOnce you\u2019ve had a chance to see how your new product was received by\nyour customers, you\u2019ll put together a recommendation for what\u2019s next: should\nyou iterate more on this feature/product, move on to something else, or end-\nof-life this feature/product? This recommendation will help inform the next\niteration through the product-development life cycle, and we\u2019ll explain how\nto create a good r ecommendation in Chapter 9.\nAs you can see, there\u2019s a lot to product management and the product-\ndevelopment life cycle! But don\u2019t worry, the following chapters will break\neach step down into more detail and help you understand how to be a great\nproduct manager who makes awesome products that customers love.", "<<<SECTION_BREAK>>>\nOne of the first things a great product manager should do before even thinking\nabout a product is to understand the company that makes it. Every company is\na little bit different, and they have different priorities, values, strengths, and\nweaknesses. Knowing these details about a company\u2014understanding the full\ncontext of its current situation\u2014is the starting point to find and evaluate\nproduct oppor tunities and make strategic product decisions. We\u2019ll build upon\nhow to leverage these details in the following chapters.\nAnalyzing a company breaks down into three main categories: What product\nare we building? How do we know if our product\u2019s good?  What else has\nbeen, is being, and will be built?", "<<<SECTION_BREAK>>>WHAT PRODUCT ARE WE BUILDING?\nThis category of analysis is focused on the company\u2019s current product. This\nmight be an existing product that you\u2019re tasked with improving, or it might be\nthe next new product that you want to build.\nWhy Does the Company Exist?\nThe most fundamental thing to understand about a company is why it exists.\nWhat\u2019s its mission statement or, even more importantly, its core belief: the\nvalue it adds to the world that differentiates it from other companies?\nSimon Sinek has a great TED talk called \u201cHow Great Leaders Inspire\nAction\u201d and a book  on the same topic, Start With Why. In both, he advoc ates\nfor what he calls the Golden Circle (Figure 2-1). Specifically, he says that the\n\u201cwhy\u201d of a company is what people actually care about and buy into. How\nyou deliver that value and the products you create will build on top of this\ncore value. From a product point of view that \u201cwhy\u201d is your guiding light\u2014it\nwill help you figure out what fits with the company\u2019s reason to exist and what\ndoesn\u2019t. Put another way, the products you build are a means to an end. That\n\u201cend\u201d is the bigger picture and what customers buy into/want to achieve when\nthey buy your products.\nThink about storytelling\u2014the \u201cwhy\u201d is the theme. What\u2019s this story about?\nWhat specific viewpoint does the writer want to share with the world that led\nto her writing the story? Themes in movies are often obvious: love conquers\nall, revenge doesn\u2019t lead to happiness, etc. A company\u2019s theme can be a little\nharder to decipher. Often its theme is expressed as a value within the\ncompany\u2019s mission statement, which you can usually find on the website. But\neven if a company has a clear mission statement with a clear theme, it may\nforget about it when making decisions, leading to mixed results.", "Let\u2019s look at Sinek\u2019s example of Apple. If Apple started with the \u201cwhat,\u201d\nwhich many companies do, Sinek asserts its messaging would read, \u201cWe make\ngreat computers. They\u2019re user-friendly, beautifully designed, and easy to use.\nWant to buy one?\u201d That\u2019s fine, but it sounds pretty generic. Many other PC\nmanufacturers even make the same claim!\nFigure 2-1. Simon Sinek\u2019s Golden Circle, starting with \u201cwhy\u201d as the most important aspect of a\ncompany.\nInstead, recall the Think Different campaign Apple ran in the late \u201990s, which\ntalked about Apple\u2019s \u201cwhy\u201d without even mentioning the products: \u201cHere\u2019s to\nthe crazy ones.\u201d Starting from that mission statement, Sinek says a more\nrealistic marketing message from Apple would be, \u201cWith everything we do,", "we aim to challenge the status quo. We aim to think differently. Our products\nare user-friendly, beautifully designed, and easy to use. We just happen to\nmake great computers. Want to buy one?\u201d\nThat version starts with the \u201cwhy\u201d (challenging the status quo), then moves\ninto the \u201chow\u201d (being user-friendly, etc.), and finally the \u201cwhat\u201d (selling great\ncomputers). It\u2019s way more compelling than the first version, and it also says a\nlot more about what Apple represents, and who they are as a company.\n\u201cWhy\u201d is at the core of the Golden Circle because it\u2019s the most fundamental\nthing you need to understand about a company. Everything a company does,\nfrom the products it builds to the feature decisions it makes for those products,\nshould emerge from that value. If it doesn\u2019t, there\u2019s a good chance that\ndecision isn\u2019t working well for the company.\nGoogle writes its mission statement as, \u201cTo organize the world\u2019s information\nand make it universally accessible and useful.\u201d There\u2019s an implicit value\npropos ition of driving the human race forward, which Google does, primarily\nwith data. It\u2019s unlikely to make a toaster oven, even a Wi-Fi-connected one,\nbecause that doesn\u2019t organize the world\u2019s information, make it accessible, or\ndrive us forward. However, Google did purchase Nest, which made\nappliance-like devices, including a thermostat and a smoke detector. Nest\u2019s\nproducts involve organizing information about your home and applying\ncomputer science to that information to make your home function better. The\nNest Thermostat learns your behavior and automatically adapts how it heats\nand cools your house to save energy\u2014thereby saving you money\u2014while still\nkeeping you comfortable.\nIt\u2019s worth noting that every company whose fundamental mission is \u201cto make\nmoney\u201d rather than focusing on what value it can add to customers\u2019 lives has\nfailed. Sinek discusses this in detail in his talk. If your company functions", "well and customers want the products you\u2019re making, you\u2019ll make money.\nRevenue is validation that a company is doing the right thing for its customers\n\u2014revenue should not be a company\u2019s reason for existing. This isn\u2019t true for\nonly socially conscious companies like TOMS, the shoe company, but for all\ncompanies. Customers will pay for your product because it makes their lives\nbetter, not because they want to give you money.\nSimilarly, companies that start without a mission, but rather with some\ninvention that they\u2019re trying to find a use for, often fail. Specifically, if your\ncompany started because someone said, \u201cThis is a cool idea\u2014can we sell\nit?\u201d rather than \u201cThis invention would make people\u2019s lives better because\u2026,\u201d\nyou have a solution looking for a problem. An engineering innovation by itself\ndoesn\u2019t make a product\u2014products are solutions to problems people\nencounter. You\u2019ll often hear startups talk about \u201cpivoting\u201d because they found\ncustomers didn\u2019t want the product they made, and the startup is trying to\nrepurpose what it built to something customers will use.\nSome companies are moderately successful without having a clear mission\nstatement. But they struggle to grow because it\u2019s be unclear to their leadership\nwhy their product was successful and how to expand the product line. The\nresult is a product portfolio that feels very disconnected. Misfit, which was\npurchased by Fossil, achieved success with its Shine wearable activity\ntracker, but it didn\u2019t have a clear mission. Its follow-up products included a\nsmart light bulb and sleep sensor, and they failed to gain much attention.\nMisfit appears to be aware of this problem and has tried to fix it, though, as\nit\u2019s now focused on making wearables a natural part of your life, with\nfashion-conscious activity trackers, and smart headphones with a built-in\nactivity tracker. The implicit value propos ition is that Misfit wants you to live\na better life, and it achieves that by enabling you to analyze your life,", "especially your health.\nAs a product manager, keeping the company\u2019s core value propos ition in\nmind will help you understand the company\u2019s vision. Understanding the vision\nwill let you understand the company\u2019s goals, which lets you understand its\nproduct roadmap. We\u2019re getting ahead of ourselves here! Suffice it to say,\nyour first task when looking at a company from a product point of view needs\nto be understanding its \u201cwhy.\u201d<<<SECTION_BREAK>>>\nCustomers and Personas\nThe most fundamental part of a company, after why it exists, is who it\u2019s\nsolving problems for. Essentially, who are the customers for your product, and\nwhy are they buying your product? You will optimize your products for these\npeople.\nLet\u2019s imagine we\u2019re building a camera accessory that plugs into the iPhone,\nlike the DxO ONE. Your customers are likely people who enjoy shooting with\ntheir smartphones, but want better image quality than the built-in camera\nprovides. Since we\u2019re iPhone-specific, we won\u2019t care about people with\nAndroid phones. And, since we\u2019re building an accessory that people need to\npay extra for, we will ignore people who are happy with the built-in camera.\nBut even amongst all the customers we do care about, there\u2019s a lot of\nvariability. Maybe one loves taking photos of his dogs while another takes\nphotos of her ferrets. Dealing with lots of real people and their variability can\nmake for complex discussions\u2014our camera accessory has to work with cats,\ndogs, ferrets, rabbits, etc. Instead, it would be easier if we just abstracted\nthings and said, \u201cOur customers take photos of their pets.\u201d\nWe can take the various common traits we care about in our potential\ncustomers and abstract them out into a persona. A persona is a fictional,", "typical customer, and defining key personas lets you segment your customers\nby highlighting the things your customers care about that are relevant to your\nproduct. Personas are tools to help you understand your customers, they are\nnot actual end customers. A great way to think about the difference is that\nFacebook  and Snapchat have many of the same customers, but their internal\npersonas\u2014how they segment those customers and what aspects of the product\nthey care about\u2014are different.\nYou\u2019ve likely already talked about a persona without realizing it. When\nsomeone asks, \u201cCan my mom use it?\u201d they don\u2019t mean their actual mom, she\nmight be a rocket scientist. Instead, they mean the \u201cmom\u201d persona of a middle-\naged person who is never the first to buy new technology, and will break\nmany gadgets simply by turning them on. When we say, \u201cCan my mom use it?\u201d\nwe\u2019re actually asking if the product is user-friendly enough that someone in\nthe \u201cmom\u201d persona can use the product to achieve a goal without breaking it\nand without asking for help.\nGood personas will have a picture and a fictional name. They will include\nany relevant details about the person\u2019s life such as demographics, outside\nactivities, and common tasks, as well as what problems the person is looking\nto solve. Think of a full persona as a way to bring a typical customer to life\u2014\nyou want enough detail that you can imagine yourself in the persona\u2019s shoes.\nRoman Pichler put this into a template you can fill out to start crafting your\nown personas (Figure 2-2).", "Figure 2-2. Roman Pichler\u2019s persona-building template, available at www.romanpichler.com and\nincluded under the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported (CC BY-SA 3.0) license, \nhttps://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0.\nWhile it\u2019s tempting to make your personas very detailed, describing every\naspect of the person\u2019s life, they can quickly become overwhelmed with lots of\nirrelevant details. Keep them as sparse as possible overall, but with enough\ndetail that they\u2019re believable and represent a real target market. If you\u2019re\nwondering how to do this, write a detailed persona, and for every statement\nyou make about the person, if it\u2019s not relevant to your product, delete it.\nThe key things you\u2019re looking for are this person\u2019s priorities, related to your\nproduct/area of expertise. What is the persona \u201cIT Tech Tom\u201d trying to do\nthat\u2019s significant and what\u2019s actually insignificant: What extreme pain points\ndoes he have and what pain points are insignificant? What are the things he", "must have from any solution you create? For example, IT Tech Tom might be\nvery busy his entire workday with customer support tickets. He would likely\nfavor a new automated machine deployment system over one that involves lots\nof manual intervention.\nA way to envision these customer\u2019s priorities is to imagine the customer\u2019s\njourney. What problem is a given persona trying to solve, what does he do\nwhen he tries to solve it, and what happens as a result? Tell us a story about\nthe customer.\nDon\u2019t forget about the social or emotional side. Dental headgear can solve\northodon tic problems\u2014a significant pain point\u2014bu t do you want to be the kid\non the playground who has to wear headgear for two years? Other factors,\nlike which distribution channels reach the various personas, and whether\nthey\u2019re willing to pay for different parts of the product, can help differentiate\npersonas.\nPersonas contain demographic information only if it\u2019s relevant. For example,\nAirbnb\u2019s \u201chost\u201d personas probably don\u2019t include how much each person\nmakes per year, but they likely do include why a persona is interested in\nrenting her place out. A young urban host might be renting a couch or second\nbedroom to help pay for his condo. In fact, he might have to do so, meaning he\ncares most about maximizing how much he gets for his space vs. having\nsomeone there all the time. A retired couple who are snowbirds, flying from\nPennsylvania to Florida each winter, might want to rent out their vacation\nhome when they\u2019re not using it, to supplement their income. They\u2019ll likely\nprefer Airbnb guests who stay for longer periods of time, and treat the home\nlike their own, even if it means their vacation home is empty periodically.\nThis might be counter to what you know about typical marketing theory,\nwhere demographics are key. Again and again, product theory and practice", "have shown that focusing on a common problem, pain, or desire yields better\nsegmentation than demographics.\nHarvard Business School professor Clayton Christensen has been working\non a customer-segmentation approach he calls \u201cjobs to be done\u201d for over a\ndecade. Thinking this way helps build great personas. The example\nChristensen gives is that when a fast-food company tried to improve its\nmilkshake sales, it first did traditional demographic segmentation and asked\neach persona (e.g., the 18\u201335- year-old milkshake drinker) about her ideal\nshake and implemented changes. Sales were stagnant.\nBut when the fast-food company focused on who bought milkshakes, when\nthey bought them, and where they drank them, it found a different way to\nsegment its customers. One segment bought milkshakes in the morning to keep\nthem feeling full until lunch. As an added benefit, the morning milkshake gave\nthem something to occupy their free hand while driving during a boring\ncommute. That group wants a milkshake that takes a while to drink so that it\nlets them feel full longer and lasts for the commute. Now consider another\nsegment: customers buying milkshakes as a special treat for young children.\nKids likely just want a tasty treat and don\u2019t have the patience to drink a\nmilkshake for 30 minutes. Using pains and goals instead of just demographics\nwill help you segment your customers into useful personas.\nIt\u2019s possible your product has multiple personas. For example, the people\nwho read and write reviews on Yelp are customers, but the businesses these\npeople review are also Yelp\u2019s customers. Create multiple personas if needed,\nand identify the primary one you want to satisfy.\nSometimes the customer and the buyer\u2014the person using the product and the\nperson actually purchasing it\u2014aren\u2019t the same, such as parents buying a swing\nset for their kids. This is common with enterprise software, and you\u2019ll need to", "create separate personas for these cases.\nUltimately your goal with each persona is to have enough information and\ndetail about that category of customer that you can imagine yourself in this\nperson\u2019s shoes. This will help you empathize with that customer, understand\nhis pain points, and think about ways your product can solve that pain (we\u2019ll\ngo into this in depth in Chapter 3).\nBecause personas help you understand what a group of customers is like, a\nkey piece of a persona is to be authentic\u2014if you find your persona is\nincredibly busy, working 80+ hours/week, how much time do you think he\u2019ll\nhave to learn how to use your product? If you fail to note how much your\npersona works, you could make the wrong product decisions, errantly\nassuming this persona has time to watch a long onboarding video tutorial.\nWhenever you start working on a new product or at a new company, find out\nas soon as possible who the relevant personas are. Make sure they\u2019re clearly\nwritten down in the Name/Picture/Details/Goals format. Many companies use\nWord or Google Docs files with their persona data, and there are specialized\ntools that explicitly manage your personas and organize the research that goes\ninto each one (As of the time of writing, the landscape of persona tools is so\nin flux that we\u2019ve elected to leave it up to you to search and find what\u2019s\ncurrent).\nIf there\u2019s nothing written down, it\u2019s still likely the company has a rough idea\nof who its customers are. Use that knowledge to write down a first draft of the\npersona, you will revise it over time.\nIt\u2019s not mandatory to have pre-existing customer knowledge to build a\npersona. Just make your personas rough at first, and as you learn more about\nyour customers, refine the personas, perhaps dividing them up and creating a\nnew persona when key differences appear. You might even find as you talk", "with customers and show them prototypes of your product/feature that\nsomeone you thought was a certain persona really isn\u2019t.\nTake Airbnb, for example. Even though business travelers travel frequently,\nthey might not be the best persona for Airbnb to focus on because they\nexpense their hotel rooms, meaning they\u2019re not price sensitive, they care more\nabout service than connecting with the host, and they often have rewards cards\nthat let them accumulate free stays for personal travel. Airbnb focuses on\nmaking interactions with your host and other locals part of your travel\nexperience. Business travelers, however, are there to work, not to feel like a\nlocal. All of that means they\u2019re currently better served by regular hotels, and\nAirbnb might choose not to spend lots of time targeting that persona right now.\nYou\u2019ll also want to ensure your personas align with what your product does.\nIf you\u2019re building payroll software for a small to medium-size business, your\npersonas should be based on coffee shops and doctor\u2019s offices, not a stay-at-\nhome dad. Stay-at-home dads won\u2019t have any reason to buy your software,\nand you want to spend your time making decisions based on the customers\nwho will buy and use your software.\nNote that \u201ceveryone\u201d is not a persona, as \u201ceveryone\u201d is too vague to help\nyou make decisions. Many people think that big companies like Google,\nFacebook , and Apple target \u201ceveryone,\u201d but they don\u2019t and are quite forward\nabout it. Facebook  started off targeted at one persona, college students. Over\ntime Facebook  grew, adding high-school students and beyond, and its current\ncustomer base is very diverse. Facebook  likely has many internal personas,\nbut when it releases new features, they\u2019re still targeted at specific personas. A\n\u201cHenrietta High-School Student\u201d persona doesn\u2019t care about the reviews\nfeature on business pages, but a business that created a Facebook  page\ncertainly does!", "Another great attribute to consider about your personas is where on the\nadoption curve they fall. Not everyone buys/starts using something new at the\nsame time. There\u2019s a general theory of adoption\u2014which can refer to a new\nproduct or a new feature\u2014that says there\u2019s a tiny group of early adopters that\nhave to be the first to have new things\u2014think of the first person you know to\nown a smartwatch. Then, there\u2019s a slightly larger group of people who like\nbeing one of the first\u2014bu t not necessarily the first\u2014to have something new\u2014\nthink of the first person you know who bought an Apple Watch but didn\u2019t own\na previous smartwatch.\nUnfortunately, there\u2019s a gap (see Figure 2-3) before you get to the next group\nof people. If your product\u2019s awesome and delivers on a value propos ition\nyour customers care about, you\u2019ll continue on to the next step, mass-market\nadoption, when the bulk of potential customers buy/use your product.\nEventually, even the late adopters\u2014the people who always seem to be years\nbehind everyone else technology-wise\u2014will start using your product.\nConsidering where your various personas fit into this curve will help you\nunderstand when they\u2019re likely to adopt your new product or feature. This\nwill help prioritize features. Early adopters will tolerate missing features that\nlaggards might require, for example.", "Figure 2-3. The adoption curve where the x-axis represents the groups of customers that will potentially\npurchase your product over time. The y-axis represents the approximate market share of each group.\nBut if your product isn\u2019t awesome, when you hit the chasm before mass-\nmarket adoption, your growth will stop because your product doesn\u2019t provide\nenough value to most people\u2019s lives. The mass market won\u2019t adopt it.\nWhenever you think about how to make a product better, your first thoughts\nshould be about who the target personas are and what needs they have that\naren\u2019t currently being met by the product. This gives you a great immediate\nfilter to make sure you\u2019re making strategic decisions about what to do n ext.<<<SECTION_BREAK>>>\nUse Cases\nUse cases are simply how a company expects each persona to use the\ncompany\u2019s product to achieve a goal. They provide the context to let you\nunderstand the link between your personas and your products.\nDay to day, a PM will need to think about what use cases they want to\nsupport for their product, which helps in finding and prioritizing\noppor tunities. The use cases will affect everything from what features you\nprioritize to solve your customers\u2019 problems to what customers you\u2019ll market\nyour product to.", "For example, a key use case for an iPhone is checking your email on the go.\nApple will make product decisions for the iPhone that help you know when\nyou have new mail, and let you reply to mail, compose new mail, etc.\nConversely, the iPhone isn\u2019t designed to help you press cloves of garlic,\nalthough you could theoretically use it to do so\u2014w e\u2019d recommend buying a\ngarlic press instead. Apple cares about the former, not the latter. The choices\nit makes will be focused on improving email on the go, even if it means a\nfuture iPhone is no good f or cooking with garlic.\nThat example is pretty drastic and obvious, so let\u2019s look at a more subtle\nexample companies often face. One major category of company is called\nenterprise or B2B (business to business), which applies to companies that\ncreate tools to address other companies\u2019 work-related needs. B2B companies\nwill frequently pick a size of customer company to focus on\u2014small, medium,\nor large\u2014and then further focus on select industry verticals.\nGusto, formerly ZenPayroll, is an HR-solutions company for small\nbusinesses. It realized that small businesses have a wide range of fairly\ncomplex \u201crun the business\u201d (RTB) needs such as HR, accounting, and office-\nadministration. One person usually can\u2019t do all of those tasks, small\nbusinesses don\u2019t have the resources to hire many people to do those tasks, and\nexisting tools like ADP are overkill for small businesses.\nGusto\u2019s initial persona was likely a small-business owner\u2014we\u2019ll call her\n\u201cSuzanne Small Business Owner.\u201d The Gusto website lists instances of this\npersona, including in her repertoire tech startups, coffee shops, auto shops,\ncreative agencies, law firms, and restaurants. Those are the customers Gusto\ntargets.\nLet\u2019s pretend Suzanne owns a coffee shop. Put yourself in her shoes for a\nsecond\u2014w hat are the RTB tasks she has to deal with? The simplest ones are", "around payroll: she wants a way to collect W2-related information (US-\ngovernment-required work forms) for her employees, she wants an easy way\nto pay employees, and she wants an automated way to provide them with tax\ninformation. These situations she wants to address\u2014problems she wants to\nsolve\u2014are use cases she might want to use Gusto for, and Gusto will likely\nbuild features to solve these problems.\nAt the top of Gusto\u2019s website is a Payroll link. When you click on it you\u2019ll\nsee that Gusto specifically states how it has employee self-onboarding for\nW2s and more, payroll solutions, and automated taxes. It has built features\ninto its product to enable it to work in these use cases that its target persona,\nSuzanne Small Business Owner, has.\nGusto initially focused on one use main use case: payroll management. But\nover time it has expanded to cover more use cases, such as health insurance.\nOver time, Gusto will likely continue to help small businesses simplify their\nRTB tasks. They\u2019ll be addressing more use cases that Suzanne Small Business\nOwner deals with.\nHowever, if a large business tried to use Gusto, the business would find\nfeatures it needed lacking because its requirements are more complex than\nthose of the small businesses that Gusto targets. Gusto doesn\u2019t handle all the\nuse cases for a large business, but a more complex product like ADP does\nhandle those use cases.\nDown the road, Gusto could choose to expand to support another customer, a\nlarge business. To address that customer, Gusto would create personas to\nrepresent the different types of large-business customers, like \u201cMultinational\nMatt.\u201d Gusto would then add features to the product to address the use cases\nlarge business have but small businesses don\u2019t, like dealing with multiple\ninternational offices. This would be one way to grow and to gain more", "customers. However, supporting large businesses and their use cases isn\u2019t\ncurrently a priority for Gusto, so it hasn\u2019t built features to address these\nneeds.\nBy focusing on specific use cases for specific personas, you can ensure that\nyour product addresses the needs of those personas effectively, which makes\nyour end customers happy. Adding features to support new use cases or\nmaking it easier to achieve current use cases is a common source of product\noppor tunities.\nEnterprise vs. Consumer Companies\nRelated to use cases and personas is knowing if the company is developing\nenterprise (B2B) or consumer (also called business-to-consumer or B2C)\nproducts. This simply means asking whether end customers are using the\nproduct in their personal lives, or at work. You likely don\u2019t need payroll\nsoftware at home, and you likely don\u2019t need a smartphone-connected sous\nvide device at work.\nThe primary difference in how these companies function is that B2B\ninvolves more decision makers, and the people who decide to buy the product\nare often not the ones using it\u2014e.g., a CTO will approve buying software for\nHR, but it\u2019s HR who uses it day to day. B2B companies often have larger\nsales forces with specialized roles such as sales engineers who help integrate\nthe product into the customer\u2019s environment, and customer-training roles.\nYou\u2019re unlikely to just start using SalesForce out of the box, for example, nor\nare you expected to.\nB2B software also historically emphasized utility over usability: that is, as\nlong as it solved your problem, it\u2019s OK if it\u2019s really painful to use. However,\nB2B technology has shifted to focus more on the end customer rather than just", "the decision maker. As we\u2019ve seen with Slack, Gusto, and more, B2B\ncompanies are acting more like B2C companies, creating software with\nintuitive design that you can use out of the box with little training, just like you\ndon\u2019t need training to use Facebook .\nThe tools and techniques you\u2019ll learn in this book  will apply to bot h styles of\ncompanies. You\u2019ll build personas and break down use cases regardless of\nwhether you\u2019re building B2B or B2C products. Just be aware that you\u2019ll have\nto do extra legwork to account for the additional decision makers and their\npersonas in a B2B company. B2B software is also more likely to be subject to\nlegal compliance requirements and to need to function in a multi-user\nenvironment, which creates additional fundamental product requirements that\nB2C software doesn\u2019t have.<<<SECTION_BREAK>>>\nHOW DO WE KNOW IF OUR PRODUCT\u2019S GOOD?\nIn Chapter 1, we mentioned that a big part of product management is knowing\nhow we keep score. Metrics, in particular success metrics, are how we\nmeasure that score.\nMetrics are the measurement of different aspects of your product. These\nmight include things within your product, like how many people complete a\ntask, or things affected by your product, like how much revenue you\u2019re\nmaking. Success metrics, sometimes called key performance indicators\n(KPIs), are the key metrics that define how we keep score, like how many\ngoals you scored in a soccer game.\nSuccess metrics are useful because they help us validate if our current\nstrategy is working, and if it\u2019s not we can dig into the overall metrics to come\nup with a hypothesis for how we could make changes to achieve our success\nmetrics (more on this in Chapter 3). While product management sometimes", "feels like more of an art than a science, metrics provide the data-driven,\nscientific backbone to product management.\nYour success metrics are defined by your current strategy and goals. Overall\ncompany success metrics come from the company\u2019s short- and long-term\nstrategy goals, with long-term metrics being defined by the company\u2019s core\nvalues\u2014the \u201cwhy\u201d we talked about earlier. If part of your company\u2019s mission\nis that you want your customers to love your products, then a key ongoing,\nlong-term strategy company success metric will be how satisfied your\ncustomers are with each product.\nYou will have additional success metrics that change over time based on\nyour short-term goals. For example, it\u2019s common to see companies switching\ntheir short-term goal from growth (people are using our product) to revenue\n(people like our product enough to pay for it). When goals change, what was a\nsuccess metric one week might just be considered a regular metric the next\nweek.\nGenerally, you\u2019ll have separate company and product success metrics, and\nthe product success metrics will support the company metrics. Maybe your\ncurrent company success metric is brand awareness, a common initial success\nmetric for startups. In that case, your product success metrics will include\nnumber of downloads of your app, visits to your website, and so on: metrics\nthat indicate people are aware of your company and products.\nLater on, your strategy might shift to making your app part of people\u2019s lives,\nin which case your success metrics will focus on engagement: Of those who\ndownloade d the app, how many complete a core task? How many customers\ndo that task each day/week/month? As your strategy and success metrics\nchange, your product plan and the features you choose to work on will\nsimilarly shift\u2014you want to make sure what you\u2019re working on supports your", "goals and success metrics.\nIt\u2019s critical to compare these metrics over time, allowing you to see if your\nstrategy is working. You might be using revenue as a success metric\u2014getting\npeople to open their wallets is a sign they value your product\u2014and perhaps\nyou have $1 million in revenue right now. That seems great until you realize\nyou had $10 m illion in revenue last month.\nA common question PMs deal with is, how do we pick the right goals and\nsuppor ting success metrics to focus on? In general, it depends on your\ncompany. But Sarah Tavel, who was Pinterest\u2019s founding PM for search and\ndiscovery and is now a partner at Greylock, noticed a trend in the success\nmetrics of successful consumer-focused internet startups, and she wrote up her\nfindings in a blog post entitled \u201cThe Hierarchy of Engagement.\u201d\nTavel noted that there are three distinct strategy phases startups, and by\nextension new products, go through: engagement, retention, and self-\nperpetuating. Startups that go through all three tend to turn into multibillion-\ndollar companies, whereas startups that get stuck in one phase commonly fail.\nThe goal of the first phase is to get customers using your product and\ncompleting the core action, like posting a photo to Instagram. This is a sign\nthey\u2019re engaged with your product, and we could say that completing the core\naction is a success metric that supports an engagement goal.\nPinterest\u2019s core action is pinning something. In 2011, when Pinterest was\ngrowing well, over 50% of its weekly users were still pinning things.\nCompare this to Viddy, a video-sharing startup that became popu lar in 2012.\nWhen Facebook  started featuring Viddy content on April 24, Viddy\u2019s growth\nskyrocketed to about 35 million users, as you see in Figure 2-4. But the daily\nactive users and the people actually posting content was much lower, peaking\naround 5 million users, or around 14% of all users. Even though Viddy", "appeared to be doing well, with lots of people signing up, very few\ncompleted that core action. Viddy shut dow n in late 2014.\nFigure 2-4. A graph of Viddy\u2019s monthly active users (top line) vs. daily active users (bottom line) for\nApril/May 2012, from KPCB/Mary Meeker\u2019s Internet Trends report.\nNow let\u2019s look at the second of Tavel\u2019s three phases, retention. After\ncompanies saw good engagement\u2014what \u201cgood\u201d  means varies\u2014they\u2019d shift\ntowards retaining users with success metrics around how frequently those\ncustomers use the product in a given time period. The idea is that if the\nproduct gets better for users over time, they will keep using it and they\u2019ll miss\nout if they leave. In fact, it\u2019s better to have slightly slower growth but a higher\npercentage of customers continuously using the product than constant growth\nbut low retention because you\u2019ll end up with more customers over time.", "A simple example of this is frequent-flier points on airlines: The more you\nfly, the more status you achieve and the more pleasant flying becomes. In\nsoftware, think about social networks. The bigger the audience you\u2019ve built up\non Twitter, the more you\u2019d have to lose by stopping using Twitter and trying to\nrebuild your audience on another network. Products that don\u2019t encourage\ncustomers to continuously use them are easily replaceable. Lyft and Uber are\nthe same for an end customer whether you\u2019ve ridden once or a hundred times.\nYou likely just request a ride from whichever service has the shortest wait\ntime. And if a new competitor comes around that offers an incentive, such as\nride 10 times and get $10 in credit, you lose nothing by deleting the Uber app\nand using the competitor instead.\nThe final phase that Tavel describes is when your goal is self-perpetuation.\nThis means your product has various loops  that keep the customer engaged,\nand encourage other customers to get engaged. Your success metrics will be\naround how often people complete these loops . Pinterest gets better when\nmore people post pins because this leads to better discovery of new, relevant\nthings to pin. And sharing notifications (which we\u2019ll look at more in Chapter\n3 with the Hook Canvas) encourage both new customers to pin something and\nexisting users to return to the product.\nTavel goes on to describe cohort performance as the ultimate success metric\nyour company should look at over time, encompassing all three of these\nstages. Specifically, look at the number of weekly users completing the core\naction and the percentage of weekly active users completing the core action\nover time. This shows growth from the size of the cohort, engagement from the\nratio of users completing the core action, and retention from your performance\nover time.\nWhile these stages don\u2019t apply directly to some products, like a B2B product", "a company mandates its employees use, the principles are still applicable.\nYou want your customers to be able to complete the core tasks in your product\nsmoothly and repeatedly, and as long as those core tasks align with use cases\nyour customers care about, your product is off to a good s tart.<<<SECTION_BREAK>>>\nVanity vs. Actionable Metrics\nAs product managers, we see a lot of metrics. Some are more helpful to us\nthan others, and we often talk about two categories of metrics: vanity and\nactionable. Vanity metrics are those that sound useful, and might be great for\nsome other business need, but don\u2019t help us measure product performance.\nActionabl e metrics are real data we can use to make decisions.\nLet\u2019s look at an example, using Tavel\u2019s first phase, engagement. When you\u2019re\nlaunching a new product, say an app, as a product manager your goal is to\nhave people completing the core task. Maybe 1 million people downloaded\nyour app on the first day\u2014congrats! That sounds awesome, right? While\ngetting someone to be aware of and download your app is the first step, it\ndoesn\u2019t mean they actually opened and used your app\u2014t hings look very\ndifferent if only 10 pe ople actually completed your app\u2019s core task.\nNumbers like page views and downloads are vanity metrics because they\nsound useful. They might be useful in investor pitch decks, negotiating\ndisplay-ad prices,1 million people look at our pages each day!, and for other\ncompany needs. But from a product management point of view, they don\u2019t help\nus measure if our product is successful.\nInstead, product managers need to focus on actionable metrics that let us\nmake decisions. Now that we know only 10 people completed our product\u2019s\ncore task, we can look at other metrics to try and figure out why so few\npeople were engaged with the app.", "<<<SECTION_BREAK>>>How to Measure Metrics\nThe most common way you\u2019ll measure metrics is by adding bits of code into\nyour product to measure customer behavior, and to automatically collect the\nindividual measurements into an analytics tool, like Google Analytics.\nUsually these measurements are very simple: How many people uploade d a\nfile? How many people clicked this button? How much time did a person\nspend looking at a web page  or a screen in an app?  Early on when planning\na product, you\u2019ll want to think about what metrics you want to capture and\nwork with your development team to capture those metrics (Chapter 5). For\nlegal reasons, customers often have to opt in to providing this analytics data,\nwhich is why you frequently see disclosures in usage term sheets or pop-ups\nin software alerting customers that you\u2019re collecting usage data for a product.\nHowever, not every metric gets captured automatically. It\u2019s tough to know\nfrom an automated tool whether customers like your product or swear at it\nmultiple times a day when they use it. If your long-term goal is for customers\nto love your product, what should you do? Companies frequently use surveys\nand interviews to sample groups of customers and gauge these higher-level\nmetrics. Sometimes these surveys are automated, such as a pop-up asking how\nyou like the app on  a scale from 1 to 10.<<<SECTION_BREAK>>>\nNet Promoter Score\u00ae\nThe Net Promoter Score (NPS) is a metric developed by Satmetrix, Bain &\nCo., and Fred Reichheld. It\u2019s a high-level way to gauge overall customer\nsatisfaction with your product by seeing how likely customers are to\nrecommend it to others, on a scale from \u2013100 to 100. The idea is that if\ncustomers love your product, they\u2019ll tell others about it. If they\u2019re ambivalent,\nthey could switch to a competitor. And if they dislike it, they might tell others", "to stay away and cost you business.\nNPS is measured by asking customers, \u201cOn a scale of 1\u201310, how likely is it\nthat you would recommend [brand] to a friend or colleague?\u201d Promoters rank\nyour brand 9 or 10 and are \u201cloyal enthusiasts who will keep buying and refer\nothers, fueling growth.\u201d These are the people you want! Passives will rank\nyou 7 or 8 and are \u201csatisfied but unenthusiastic customers who are vulnerable\nto competitive offerings.\u201d Detractors score you from 0 to 6 and \u201care unhappy\ncustomers who can damage your brand and impede growth through negative\nword-of-mouth.\u201d\nFrom those replies, the NPS is the percentage of promoters minus the\npercentage of detractors, giving you a score from \u2013100 to 100. Reichheld, in\nhis 2003 article about NPS, entitled \u201cThe One Number You Need to Grow,\u201d\nfound that many companies\u2019 NPS were low, with a median being 16 across\n400 companies, showing that a lot of companies have work to do to improve\ncustomer satisfaction!\nMeasuring NPS over time is a way to see how customers are reacting to the\nproduct changes you make (or don\u2019t make). If your company\u2019s goal is\ncustomer satisfaction, with NPS as your success metric, and your NPS is\nlower than you\u2019d like, then your immediate product goals will be around\nimproving your customers\u2019 happiness. We\u2019ll dig into how to figure out what\nchanges to make to improve customer satisfaction in Chapters 3 and 4.\nWhew\u2014for such a simple concept, there\u2019s sure a lot to success metrics. But\nthey are incredibly important to product managers, as they let us figure out if\nour product and the strategy we\u2019re taking are meeting our short- and long-term\ngoals.<<<SECTION_BREAK>>>\nWHAT ELSE HAS BEEN, IS BEING, AND WILL BE", "BUILT?\nUnfortunately you can\u2019t look at a product or a company in complete isolation\naround this moment in time. What the company did in the past likely has an\nimpact on where it is now. Microsoft completely missed the start of the\nmobile era, and that has led to its drive now to be \u201cmobile-first, cloud-first.\u201d\nIt\u2019s also worth thinking about where a product might go next. While\nsometimes you\u2019ll build a product by releasing it to customers, getting\nfeedback, and reacting to customer demand, you\u2019ll also often need to think\nabout the long term to support overall company strategic initiatives. What do\nyou want to do in three months, in six months, or in two years that you need to\nlay the groundwork for today? Maybe your product is free right now but your\ncompany wants to add a subscription payment system\u2014your customers aren\u2019t\nasking to pay you each month, but your company needs to generate revenue to\nsurvive. You\u2019ll need to do work now so that you can handle billing\ninformation later.<<<SECTION_BREAK>>>\nRoadmap\nCompanies generally collect their product plans into a roadmap. A roadm ap\nis a document that shows what the company/product is doing now, what the\ncompany/product plans to do over the next N months, what the\ncompany/product plans to do later, roughly how much effort each high-level\ntask will take, what products the company will create, and what features they\nwill have, etc. It\u2019s a valuable tool to help people communicate about the\ncompany, both internally by helping employees understand what projects\nyou\u2019re working on next, and externally by helping partners anticipate your\nneeds or plan for products you\u2019re releasing, a situation common with\nhardware-component providers.", "Roadmaps are often fairly detailed in the short term\u2014short term being 3 to 6\nmonths for most software, 6 to 12 months for large software projects, and 12\nto 18 months for hardware\u2014and become more vague over the long term. This\nhappens over the long term because priorities can change, and it\u2019s not worth\nplanning out details for things that might not happen. Just knowing you want to\nwork on something at a high level is sufficient.\nCompanies and products will have related roadmaps. The company-level\none defines how all the products come together, and the product one\u2014\nobviously\u2014focuses on each specific product. Company roadmaps are\ngenerally determined by senior executives at a company, such as the CEO or\nthe head of product. Product roadmaps are created by the product\u2019s PMs, and\nare often influenced by and exert influence over the company roadmap.\nThe factors we discussed at the very beginning of this chapter, in the \u201cWhat\nProduct Are We Building?\u201d section, affect the roadmap, too. The best\nroadmaps are ones where the company has set goals to achieve and then\nplanned projects that will help it achieve those goals. These roadmaps will\nalso provide the sense of the ownership needed for each project, and\ndetermine the order in which the projects should happen. The next chapters\nwill cover how we find oppor tunities and how items end up on the roadmap,\nbut for now simply know that roadmaps are not arbitrary.\nRoadmaps take many forms. Sometimes they\u2019re a spreadsheet using colors to\nshow all the scheduled projects, their timeframes, and what goal each project\nsupports. Other times companies use a special tool like Aha! (http://aha.i o)\nthat has additional features, such as bug-tracking integration with Jira so that\nyou can dig into specific details like how each bug relates to the roadmap. It\ndoesn\u2019t matter what tool you use to create your roadmap\u2014it matters that you\nhave a roadmap.", "There\u2019s one major risk with roadmaps\u2014you don\u2019t know the future, and if\nyour plans change someone might ask you later on why you didn\u2019t deliver an\nitem on the roadmap. Keeping roadmaps up to date and keeping items further\nout intentionally vague\u2014even if you have more accurate timing estimates\u2014\ncan help alleviate this issue.<<<SECTION_BREAK>>>\nCompetition and Climate\nThe last element to think about when trying to understand a company is what\u2019s\ngoing on around that company: What are other people building? Who are the\ncompany \u2019s main competitors? How are their target use cases, personas , and\nend customers different? How are their produc ts different? How are they\nwinning or losing compared to another company ? Are you aware of who\u2019s\nout there?\nAt Product School, we had a student who cofounded a service focused on\nhelping schools book  their facilities for other events. Originally, he and his\ncompany were not aware of any other competitors. However, while the\nstudent was in class and working on his final project, he discovered that\nanother company had pivoted from focusing on broader book ing services to\nfocusing specifically on schools. While this was validation that there\u2019s an\noppor tunity with the use cases his company was targeting and it focused on\ndelivering a better product than its competitors, it stressed him out knowing\nthat his company wasn\u2019t the only one playing in that space anymore!\nBeyond competition, what\u2019s going on in the industry in general? Has some\nbroader invention or change caused every company to drastically alter its\nplans? For example, as smartwatches become popu lar, many companies are\nracing to create their own watches or versions of their apps for watches. And\nwith Google Chrome now blocking Flash ads, ad tech companies are forced", "to adjust their plans to deal with this change.\nBroader world changes can impact a company, too. China devalued its\ncurrency in August 2015, possibly to keep its manufacturing rates attractive,\nand that has had an impact on revenue for companies that sell in China. It also\nmight have had an influence any company looking to build its products in\nVietnam.\nThe world, and especially technology, doesn\u2019t stand still! A great PM will\nstay on top of the news to make sure that her company doesn\u2019t fall by the\nwayside because it missed a broader force that changed!<<<SECTION_BREAK>>>\nA 5C ANALYSIS\nIf you\u2019ve ever talked with consultants or MBAs, you probably heard them\nname-drop a framework or seven. There is a variety of \u201cstandard\u201d\nframeworks in the business world\u2014w e say \u201cstandard\u201d because there are\nmany similar frameworks, and different companies pick different standards.\nWe\u2019ll cover some common ones in this book , but we will always prioritize\npresenting things with a product focus, even if it means we don\u2019t use a\nframework.\nThere\u2019s a framework called 5C that\u2019s similar to the areas we just covered.\nIt\u2019s a situational framework, meaning it helps you understand a company\u2019s\ncurrent situation so that you can create an oppor tunity hypothesis. The 5C\nstructure is generic\u2014useful to product, marketing, and more\u2014whereas the\nway we presented the sections in this chapter is very focused on product\nmanagement. It\u2019s good to know what the \u201cC\u201ds stand for because you\u2019ll likely\nhear 5C mentioned. Plus if you need to do a  situational analysis on your feet in\na meeting or interview, it\u2019s relatively easy to remember.\nCompany: This refers to the company\u2019s experience, technology, culture,", "goals, and more. It\u2019s similar to the material we covered in the \u201cWhy Does\nthe Company Exist?,\u201d \u201cHow Do We Know If Our Product\u2019s Good? ,\u201d and\n\u201cWhat Else Has Been, Is Being, and Will Be Built?\u201d sections.\nCustomers: Who are the people buying this product? What are the market\nsegments? How big are they? What are people\u2019s goals with buying this\nproduct? How do they make buying decisions? Where do they buy this type\nor product? This is similar to what we covered in the \u201cCustomers and\nPersonas\u201d and \u201cUse Cases\u201d sections.\nCollaborators: Who are the external people who make the product possible,\nincluding distributors, suppliers, logistical operators, groundwork support\npersonnel, and so on?\nCompetitors: Who is competing for your customers\u2019 money? This includes\nactual and potential competitors. You should look at how they position their\nproduct, the market size they address, their strengths and weaknesses, and\nmore.\nClimate: These are the macro-environmental factors, like cultural,\nregulatory, or technological trends and innovations.\nSometimes product managers add a \u201cP\u201d to the 5C structure for \u201cproduct,\u201d and\nspecifically call out the product(s) the company makes. This is a mix of what\nwe covered in the \u201cWhat Else Has Been, Is Being, and Will Be Built?,\u201d \u201cHow\nDo We Know If Our Product\u2019s Good? ,\u201d and \u201cUse Cases\u201d sections.<<<SECTION_BREAK>>>\nINTRODUCING MOOVER.IO\nThroughout this book , we\u2019ll use a fictional company, Moove r.io, as a case", "study. Let\u2019s look at its company context using the principles in this chapter.\nMoove r was started about a year ago to help people save time\u2014its \u201cwhy\u201d\u2014\ninitially focusing on making it easy to get estimates and book  a move.\nCurrently, Moover has an iOS app where you enter some very basic details\nabout your move: zip codes to and from, date you want to move, packing\nneeds, number of rooms, number of stairs, and any other special notes. You\nclick \u201cSubmit\u201d, and over the next few days, moving companies return bids. If\nyou see one you like, you can tap \u201cBook\u201d, and Moove r sends a note to the\nmoving company, which follows up with a phone call to confirm any needed\ninformation. Moove r charges a small, fixed fee of $10 when you click\n\u201cBook,\u201d using Apple Pay or PayPal. There\u2019s also a simple web dashboard\napp for the moving companies, where they can see outstanding bids with the\nbasic information about the potential customer\u2019s home, along with whether a\ncustomer accepted or rejected the bid.\nMoove r\u2019s target use case is moving from and within bigger cities, as it\u2019s\nworked with only moving companies in San Francisco, New York, Los\nAngles, and Chicago to set up the service.\nMoove r has two key personas. The first is the moving company, Ant Moving.\nAnt is a mid-sized moving company with about 10 crews that has someone in\nthe office who gives estimates over the phone full-time. Ant doesn\u2019t have a\nfull online book ing system set up because it\u2019s easier and cheaper to do things\nby hand. The second persona is Really Busy Rob. Rob\u2019s a busy person who\nlikes using app services to handle the mundane details in life. He prefers Lyft\nto owning a car, orders dinner from Postmates, and more. Rob doesn\u2019t mind\npaying a small fee for these services, as he feels his time outweighs the fee.\nRob works a lot, and having to arrange a move is the last thing on his mind!\nMoove r also learned from interviewing lots of potential \u201cRobs\u201d that Rob", "could easily be \u201cRoberta\u201d because gender doesn\u2019t matter. Rob\u2019s likely been\nout of school for a few years and has accumulated enough stuff that his\npossessions don\u2019t fit into his car anymore, and we won\u2019t find Rob on a\ncollege campus.\nMoove r has two current business goals: to find ways to improve customer\nsatisfaction, and to grow the business. Moove rs currently experiencing\nlimitations that prevent it from reaching this goal, for example, right now that\nfollow-up phone call to plan details is annoying, especially if the moving\ncompany has to come on-site, and Moove r has no way to handle special\ncases, like a piano. The people at Moove r, however, aren\u2019t sure what they\nshould focus on next, nor are they sure if they\u2019re missing an oppor tunity.\nRight now, moving tech isn\u2019t exactly a hot market, and Moove r\u2019s main\ncompetitors are specific companies\u2019 book ing systems and people willing to\nmake a few phone calls\u2014or use a service like Fiverr to have someone make\nthe phone calls for him.\nMoove r just raised $1 million and hired its second product manager: you!\nThroughout this book , we\u2019re going to help Moove r figure out what feature to\nbuild next and walk through how to build it.<<<SECTION_BREAK>>>\n________ \nCHAPTER TWO TIP\nThroughout  this book , to give you an additional perspective, we\u2019ve asked\nexperienced produc t manage rs to share their best advice about  each", "chapter\u2019s topic.\nOur first tip comes from Jeremy Toeman, vice president of produc ts at\nCNET. Jeremy runs CNET\u2019s audience development, engage ment, and social\nmedia teams, and he\u2019s respons ible for building CNET\u2019s multichanne l\nproduc ts, including web, mobile, and apps . Jeremy has more than 20 years\nof experience, including being VP of produc t manage ment at Sling Media;\nworking on Dropcam, Sonos , and Sphe ro; and foundi ng multiple companies\nthat had successful exits. In other words, he knows what he\u2019s talking about !\nHere\u2019s what he has to say about  personas .\nMAKING PERSONAS REAL WITH EMPATHY\nWith ~20 years under my belt, I\u2019ve noticed the consistent trend is for product managers to define\npersonas with 90% demographics, and 10% wants/needs/emotions. Maybe less. For example, it\u2019s easy to\ncreate Jill\u2014a 23-year-old in a major metro who has a roommate, loves travel, and is very into the DJ\nscene. Jill is thinking about buying her first car. That\u2019s a great starting point. But it\u2019s barely the tip of the\niceberg.\nDoes Jill care about what the car says about her, or does she care about fuel efficiency? Is Jill focused\non saving money, or on resale value? Does Jill care about the car tech, or just that it gets her places?\nFurther, does Jill enjoy the research process, or does she just want to be pointed in the right direction? Is\nshe going to make a little comparison spreadsheet for herself, or just wing it?\nFar too often products are coming to market without considering the needs of the individual, as opposed\nto pure demographic fit. All of the above scenarios are valid to a product manager who is designing a\nsite/app to cater to car buyers. But a simple review of car-buying websites shows a distinct lack of\nconsideration for emotional needs versus purely practical ones.\nWhen the TV industry tried to bring 3D technology into the house, they showed a distinct lack of\nempathy. Sure, 3D movies were performing well in theaters, so it made logical sense to bring that kind of\ntech into the home. But an empathic product manager could have easily predicted the poor reception:\nmovie theaters are primarily solitary (though shared) experiences, whereas family/living rooms are\nprimarily social experiences. And no family wants to sit on the couch wearing a bunch of goofy glasses\n(not a problem in a darkened theater).", "Great product managers can put themselves into the mindset of the persona, and really get into his/her\nskin to understand the wants and needs and, most importantly, the emotional triggers of their users. And\ntruly great product managers will cycle through many different personas as they consider the product\u2019s\ncore needs. This process determines the subtle differences that can take good products and transform\nthem into exceptional ones.<<<SECTION_BREAK>>>", "A key part of your role as a product manager is understanding your customers\nand their problems and needs, and making sure what you\u2019re building next is\nright for them, be it a feature or a new product. At the end of the day, very\nfew companies fail because their technology doesn\u2019t work. Companies fail\nfor lack of customers.\nHere\u2019s a dirty secret: everyone thinks they know what their customers need.\nBut like we mentioned in Chapter 1, most people\u2014even your boss\u2019s boss\u2014\nreally have no idea what customers need until they\u2019ve done some work!\nEvery company has a different approach to figuring out what customers want,\nand there are tweets, blog posts, book s, and epic operas about how to do so", "\u2014well, maybe not operas, yet.\nWe\u2019re going to take an approach modeled on the scientific method\u2014c ome\nup with a hypothesis about your customer needs and how you can address\nthem, then validate or invalidate it. This chapter will cover different ways to\ngenerate a hypothesis. Chapter 4 will discuss how to validate it, and Chapter\n5 will help you transition from ideation to execution.\nKeep in mind what we\u2019re teaching you is just one way to approach figuring\nout what to do next, albeit it is a good one. A lot of the content in this chapter\nis a bit chicken-and-egg\u2014some of the material we taught in Chapter 2 comes\ninto play here, as does future material from the Customer Development\nsection of Chapter 4. C ustomer development can influence your personas, use\ncases can inform oppor tunities, and so on. Rather than debate ad nauseam\nwhere to start, we\u2019ve chosen an approach. We encourage you to keep a\nsimilar mental model, based on the scientific method, no matter where you\nstart, so that you\u2019re always making informed decisions about what to do n ext.<<<SECTION_BREAK>>>\nYOU HAVE OPINIONS, NOT FACTS\nThere\u2019s some bad news you should know up front. Generally, less than 50%\nof ideas you\u2019ll execute\u2014even awesome ideas\u2014improve the metrics they\u2019re\nsuppos ed to improve. Amazon tests all its new ideas and has data to back up\nthis 50% figure. Yammer follows a similar practice and has seen similar\nnumbers. As a product manager, you want to find ways to spend your time on\nfeatures that matter. This starts with accepting that your ideas start off as\nopinions and not facts.\nIt\u2019s sometimes very hard for product managers to grasp that their opinions\nare not necessarily truth. We like being right, and we\u2019re taught in school that\nit\u2019s bad to be wrong. The real world\u2014a nd building products\u2014isn\u2019t like that.", "It\u2019s OK to be wrong, but we want to figure out if we\u2019re wrong as soon as\npossible and course-correct before we put lots of resources into our\nincorrect opinions. If you\u2019re wrong but insist you\u2019re right, the product will\nfail. But if you\u2019re wrong, realize it quickly, and adjust accordingly, you\u2019re\nmuch more likely to succeed.\nHow often has someone said to you, \u201cI have a million-dollar idea for a\nproduct that does x,\u201d and the voice inside your head answers, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t\nbuy it.\u201d Lots of people have opinions about what product or feature to build.\nEveryone assumes they\u2019re average, and that if they want something, lots of\nother people do, too. Because of this, many people go immediately from an\nidea right to building it, never once seeing if others would actually buy the\nproduct. Early-stage startups frequently have this problem\u2014these are also\noften the startups that eschew product management. Unfortunately, these\ncompanies end up in trouble because after spending lots of money to build a\nproduct, they find out no one wants it. As a result, bad things happen, ranging\nfrom their abandoning the product without recouping their investment to\ngoing out of business.\nWouldn\u2019t it be great if you could limit these disaster scenarios in a cost-\neffective way? The approach we\u2019re going to teach you, focused on creating\nand validating an idea, will let you quickly and cheaply filter out ideas that\nwon\u2019t help you. Note we\u2019re not talking about \u201cbad\u201d ideas\u2014an idea could be\ngood bu t just not help you or your customers.\nSteve Blank, a tech entrepreneur, worked with a number of startups and\nnoticed a trend in the ones that failed. Specifically, these startups would\nfocus on their business plans and go right to product development, skipping\nany validation of their fundamental idea\u2014sound familiar? By the time a\nstartup would get feedback from customers, it would be so far down a path", "that it\u2019d be tough to make changes. Blank noticed that startups failed mainly\ndue to lack of customers and a profitable business model, and the ones he\nworked with and their investors didn\u2019t see value in taking time to figure out if\npeople really wanted what they were building. Ironically, this disconnect\nwas especially an issue for the startups\u2019 founders, who created the initial\nhypothesis the company was founded on. They quickly became isolated from\ndirect customer feedback, as they hired people such as marketers to interact\nwith customers for them.\nBlank\u2019s work led him to conclude that \u201cin a startup no facts exist inside the\nbuilding; only opinions.\u201d He then created the idea of customer development,\nwhich essentially says that whatever you come up with at first is an opinion;\nyou might be wrong, and you need to interact with real potential customers to\nlearn the truth ASAP. This chapter is about forming a good opinion. Chapter\n4 is about how to find out the truth about your opinion.\nCustomer development became a core part of lean methodology, which we\nbriefly mentioned in Chapter 1. Lean Startup is a business that applies a\nproduct developmental methodology, adapted by Steve Blank and Eric Ries\nfrom Toyota\u2019s revolutionary manufacturing pipeline, to product/software\ndevelopment. Lean Startup is focused on helping companies be successful by\nquickly and iteratively determining what customers want, building something\nthat fills only that need, va lidating the solution, and repeating.\nCustomer development is a key part of Lean Startup because it\u2019s a way to\nquickly increase your learning, so as to avoid wasting time. We believe this\napproach is useful both in startups trying to develop their initial product and\nin established companies improving existing products. After all, a great PM\nneeds to help the customer be awesome, and you want to focus your time on\nbuilding things they need!", "With this in mind, how do you create the best possible hypothesis about\nwhat your customers want?<<<SECTION_BREAK>>>\nWHAT\u2019S YOUR GOAL AND HOW DO YOU WANT TO\nACHIEVE IT?\nThe very first thing to establish is your goal for this product development life\ncycle iteration. Is your company focused on acquiring new users? Does it\nwant to improve revenue? There\u2019s no silver bullet to pick the right goal to\nfocus on\u2014if you\u2019ve achieved a core set of engaged customers who\ncontinuously use your product, perhaps your next goal will be revenue,\nfollowed by growth. Your main priority is to pick a specific goal. What you\npick to work on next will be in service of this goal, and this is the core of\nhow PMs strategically choose what to work on next.\nNext, you need to think about how to achieve that high-level goal with an\nactual product. How do you want to achieve that goal at a high level? Do you\nwant to iterate on an existing product, finding ways to improve it? Do you\nwant to build something completely new\u2014a blue-sky oppor tunity, also\nsometimes called blue water or ocean? In making this decision you can focus\nyour thinking so that you can determine the details about what to build to\nachieve your goal.\nLet\u2019s look at iteration first. Start by translating your higher-level business\ngoal into a product goal, then focus on what changes we can make to a\nproduct to help meet that goal. For example, the company might want\nimproved customer satisfaction, which could translate into \u201cgetting\ncustomers to read more articles\u201d because that\u2019s a sign customers like the\ncontent.\nAnother example of using iteration to achieve a goal is when Facebook", "changed the Like button to have different types of reactions, such as love,\nsadness, and anger. Facebook \u2019s goal might have been to get more\nengagement, and the Facebook  PMs implicitly knew they wanted to improve\nthe core product rather than build something new. They decided to provide\nusers with more post-feedback reactions\u2014liking a post about someone\u2019s dog\ndying never seemed like the right reaction, and some users probably chose to\npost nothing rather than like the post. The sad reaction now provides an easy\nway to give the poster feedback, leading to more engagement on posts.\nIterations aren\u2019t just small changes, though. An iteration might be a\ncomplete overhaul or rewrite of the app or a feature, like when Gmail redid\nits \u201cCompose\u201d interface or when Apple switched from skeuomorphism to flat\ndesign in iOS 7. The key definition of an iterative change is that you\u2019re taking\nan existing product and making it better.\nIteration is incredibly important, as the first version of a product is never\nperfect for all customers, and it\u2019s through iteration that a product evolves to\nbecome something customers love. If you don\u2019t have product/market fit yet,\nwe\u2019d recommend focusing on achieving it before trying to focus on revenue\nor growth goals. What is also nice about iteration is that you already have\ninformation about how the customers are using the product, and your\nhypothesis about what to do next might come from quantitative sources (like\nhow many users complain about a bug), or qualitative sources (like ideas the\nsupport team has).\nThe downside to iteration is that you can get stuck finding the \u201clocal\nmaxima.\u201d This means that you\u2019ve optimized something really well, but you\nfocused so much on optimization that you missed a bigger shift that happened.\nThink about Blockbuster Video. Blockbuster could\u2019ve spent lots of time\niterating and come up with the ideal balance of price and rental days/late", "fees. It might have also iterated on the overall store experience, aiming to\noptimize number of rentals per customer, and come up with an in-store\nrecommendation tool to optimize customer satisfaction, ensuring that every\ncustomer walked out with a movie. However, it still would\u2019ve gone out of\nbusiness because it missed the global change where customers switched to\nstreaming video. This is where blue-sky thinking comes into play.\nA blue-sky oppor tunity is something totally new. The biggest blue-sky\nexamples occur when you believe the market/world is changing in a certain\nway, and you need to make a big transformation to address a need that might\nnot exist yet but you believe will exist in the future. While maybe you could\nmake changes to your existing product to address this oppor tunity, this new\noppor tunity is different enough that it\u2019s best addressed by building something\nnew, designing from the ground up to take advantage of that oppor tunity.\nBlue-sky oppor tunities also arise when you see a new oppor tunity to expand\nyour business into areas it doesn\u2019t serve right now because you believe those\nareas will have future value.\nTo put it simply, blue-sky oppor tunities are about skating to where the puck\nwill be, not where it is now. Sometimes blue-sky oppor tunities arise by\nthinking more broadly or reframing how you\u2019re approaching a problem:\nBlockbuster saw its business as \u201cvideo stores\u201d and was locked into handing\ncustomers tapes and DVDs. Netflix focused on \u201ccontent delivery,\u201d and it\ndidn\u2019t matter if that content came from the mail or streaming video. By\nthinking about how to let customers watch movies and TV shows in a\ndifferent way, Netflix saw a means to exceed Blockbuster\u2019s local maxima\nand find a new global maxima.\nAnother example of reframing to find a blue-sky oppor tunity is the life-\ninsurance company MetLife. The company made an app, Infinity, to create", "your digital legacy by curating your memories. Digital legacies are becoming\nfar more of an issue than they were even 10 years ago. Your life-insurance\ncompany is the one business that knows for sure if you\u2019re alive, so who\nbetter to trust with the key to passing on your photos, documents, and more\nwhen you die?\nSometimes, new technology and trends, like cloud computing, change how\nwe solve problems, creating new oppor tunities. Looking at photo\nmanagement; we\u2019ve moved from physical albums to digital tools such as\niPhoto. But even after iPhoto had been out for about 15 years\u2014an eternity for\ntechnology\u2014Apple decided the future of photo management was in the cloud.\nRather than try to make iPhoto capable of managing a cloud-based photo\nlibrary, Apple deprecated iPhoto in favor of an entirely new product, Photos.\nUnlike iPhoto, Photos was built from the ground up for iOS, since most\npeople take their photos with a smartphone rather than a digital camera.\nAnother example of new technology creating blue-sky oppor tunities is when\nFacebook , recognizing the potential of virtual reality (VR), spent $2 billion\nto purchase Oculus, believing that the future value of Oculus\u2019 VR and its\nmetaverse, to connect everyone together, would be huge and more than justify\nthat price.\nThe downside to blue-sky thinking is the potential risk. Blue-sky thinking\nalways requires a guess\u2014even if it\u2019s a well-educated one\u2014about what is\ngoing to happen, and developing blue-sky products takes resources away\nfrom iterating on existing products with real customers. New products almost\nalways lose money at first because in addition to taking resources to\ndevelop, you must convince customers to use this new tool, causing key\nmetrics will be lower at first.\nThis risk factor is where the \u201cinnovator\u2019s dilemma\u201d comes from. It\u2019s hard", "for incumbent companies to justify trying to build the next big thing when they\ncould be spending their money growing their current product, finding the\nlocal maxima. This leads companies to focus too much on their short-term\ngoals, missing larger oppor tunities because of the short-term drop in profits\nthat would result. After all, their current business is doing well: why change?\nFor this reason, private startups that can find a new oppor tunity stand a\nchance of disrupting an incumbent\u2014did anyone expect taxis to be as\ndisrupted as they have been by the smartphone-app-based business model\nand the sharing economy?\nOf course, big companies don\u2019t want to be disrupted, so they\u2019re also often\ntrying to find blue-sky oppor tunities. Alphabet is a great example of how a\nbig company can address the innovator\u2019s dilemma\u2014most of Alphabet\u2019s\nrevenue comes from Google search ads. If the company just sat around,\noptimizing that revenue, it\u2019d have a few really great years. But Alphabet\nknows that business model won\u2019t last forever, and it would rather find the\nnext big thing before someone else does. Alphabet is constantly trying to\ncome up with the next big thing, and some of its work\u2014such as self-driving\ncars\u2014looks promising but hasn\u2019t paid off yet, whereas other investments\ndidn\u2019t work out as well as Alphabet hoped\u2014like buying Boston Dynamics.\nUnfortunately, if you follow Alphabet stock, you\u2019ll see that investors don\u2019t\nlike all these experimental bets\u2014they want to see choices that give\nimmediate returns.\nIf you have an existing product, it\u2019s totally reasonable if your first\noppor tunity hypothesis focuses on iteration rather than blue-sky\nimprovements. But as you work to validate your hypothesis, you might\nrealize the best way to achieve your goals and address your customers\u2019 needs\nis by building something new.", "Thus far, you should have established a high-level company goal, translated\nthat goal to a product goal with key success metrics (why you\u2019re making this\nchange), and thought about if you want to accomplish your goal by changing\nyour existing product or building something new (how you\u2019re going to\naccomplish your goal). Now let\u2019s look at how we come up with what\nspecifically we can do to accomplish our goal.<<<SECTION_BREAK>>>\nQUANTITATIVELY FINDING AN OPPORTUNITY\nHYPOTHESIS\nThere are two major ways to determine what we want to do to achieve our\ngoal: qualitative reasoning, and quantitative reasoning. Quantitative\nreasoning involves looking at data, interpreting it, and using that analysis to\ndetermine what to do next. Qualitative reasoning involves more abstract\nconcepts like looking at your overall product vision or your intuition based\non your knowledge of your customers in determining the next step to take.\nWe\u2019ll look at quantitative reasoning first because it\u2019s the most common way\nPMs determine what to build next.\nQuantitative sources are important because they allow us to collect data on\nhow people actually use our product, to use that data to find insights, and then\nto apply those insights to determine what to do next. For example, perhaps\nLyft wants to increase customer retention by getting people to use Lyft instead\nof Uber. We can turn that into a specific product goal by focusing on how to\ndecrease the number of rides cancelled\u2014fewer cancellations means more\npassengers served and happier drivers, which means more payment. This\nwill also come by tweaking the current product, rather than building\nsomething new. When you cancel a ride in Lyft, you need to specify a reason.\nA PM at Lyft could look at the responses and come up with ideas about how", "to mitigate those reasons. Maybe he notices that midday the number of people\ncancelling their rides due to wait times skyrockets compared to the morning\nor evening. As a result, perhaps he\u2019d find ways to incentivize drivers to be\non the road midday, decreasing wait times, decreasing cancellations, and\nultimately keeping customers in a Lyft rather than an Uber.\nQuantitative sources are also nice because, after we\u2019ve come up with and\nimplemented our idea, we can compare the data before and after the change,\nand determine if it was successful. Our Lyft PM would compare the\npercentage of rides being cancelled and the reasons why to see if his change\ndecreased the number of cancellations.\nIt\u2019s worth noting that quantitative sources are useful for both iterative and\nblue-sky oppor tunities, as are qualitative sources. Data on how customers\nuse your current product might yield ways you can iterate the current product,\nor they could point out a trend that reveals an oppor tunity for a blue-sky\nproject.<<<SECTION_BREAK>>>\nMetrics and Analytics\nHow do you know what to do if you don\u2019t know what your customers are\ndoing? As we\u2019ve discussed before, metrics are measurements of different\ntasks users do within your product. Metrics are the most common source of\nquantitative data about your product and your customers.\nMetrics take many forms, from \u201cHow many people do you swipe right or\nleft on per session in this app?\u201d to \u201cHow many people who came to your site\nvia a specific affiliate\u2019s link completed a purchase?\u201d In Chapters 1 and 2 we\ntalked about success metrics, which are the key indicators of if you\u2019re\nachieving your goals and if your customers are winning. When working with\nmetrics, start by asking yourself if you\u2019re happy with where your success", "metric is\u2014is it at the right level to effectively achieve your product goal, and\nif not, how can you improve this success metric?\nNot every metric is a success metric. For example, our key success metric\nmight be how many people complete a purchase, but we\u2019ll also measure how\nmany people add items to a cart and how many people tap the checkout\nbutton.\nPut together, these metrics give us a sense of what\u2019s going on\ncomprehensively with the product. If lots of people tap the checkout button\nbut very few actually complete a purchase, then we might have an\noppor tunity to improve the checkout workflow so that more people complete\na purchase. Workflows are often called funne ls, and are great sources of\noppor tunity hypotheses\u2014we\u2019ll cover them shortly.\nWe call the process of gathering and analyzing these metrics collectively\nanalytics. Analytics let you understand the state of your product, giving you a\nmuch better idea about what your customers are doing and how your\nproduct\u2019s working for them. Analytics make metrics useful by giving them\ncontext, allowing you to discover insights about what to do n ext.\nThink about metrics as individual data points, such as a car\u2019s position, how\nfast it\u2019s traveling, the number of passengers, etc. In addition to seeing a\nsuccess metric, like \u201cthe user turned the car off after driving for a while,\u201d\nanalytics put those data points together to help you realize the family\u2019s taking\ntheir weekly drive to Grandma\u2019s house. Analytics also let you see if the\nfamily made it to Grandma\u2019s or if they ran out of gas. If the family constantly\nruns out of gas before achieving their goal of getting to Grandma\u2019s, you as a\nPM will look for ways to help them not run out of gas. OK, this metaphor\u2019s\nrun out of gas. Let\u2019s move on.\nAnalytics and metrics are useful for several reasons. The first is that people", "often aren\u2019t aware of exactly what they do, and numerous studies have shown\nthat self-reporting usage is unreliable. Automatically recording their actions\nlets us see what people are really doing with our product and how they got\nthere.\nIf your product is very large, analytics can reveal a problem on one specific\nsection that you might not find manually. Imagine if you were a PM at\nAmazon, and you wanted to watch how many people bought each product. If\npeople stop buying various products, that\u2019s a warning you should look at the\nproduct to see what\u2019s up. If you asked everyone what they bought, you\u2019d have\nan impossible task because of the customer volume. If you randomly\nsurveyed people, you\u2019d likely miss many niche products. Automated\nanalytics, however, could easily find a product where the number purchased\nsuddenly droppe d from an average of five per day to zero.\nFinally, when you look at analytics over time, you can get a gauge for where\nyou\u2019re going. Perhaps your growth rate has leveled off. If you\u2019re unhappy\nwith your trajectory, you\u2019ll dig into the component metrics to find the\nproblem, and determining a way to address that problem will form your\noppor tunity hypothesis. Again, after you\u2019ve implemented the solution, you\ncan re-evaluate these metrics to see if your strategy worked.\nThere are many analytics tools, with Google Analytics (Figure 3-1) and\nMixpanel being two of the most popu lar for web and mobile apps. Adding\nthese tools to your product is fairly straightforward and just requires a bit of\ntracking code and annotations so that you can track specific things, such as\nhow many times a user clicks Play on a video. Physical products often\nrequire completely different analytics techniques, but as more physical\nproducts become connected, it\u2019s possible to collect similar usage data.", "Figure 3-1. A sample screen from Google Analytics showing how often various events, the metrics\nwe\u2019re analyzing, occur over time.\nIt\u2019s worth noting that analytics data isn\u2019t always perfect, and those\nimperfections can skew your analysis. If your app supports multiple\nplatforms, the event might accidentally be tagged as \u201ceventA\u201d on Android\nand \u201cevent A\u201d on iOS. This means you won\u2019t see the total times Event A\nhappens unless you notice the problem and account for it.\nOther times, there are inherent issues in your analytics tools. Google\nAnalytics only samples a subset of your traffic for its reports, but for high-\ntraffic websites that sample might not accurately represent your real data. If\nthe data doesn\u2019t correctly represent what your customers are doing, you might\nmake the wrong decisions.\nLet\u2019s dig into how to use analytics to look at specific metrics and find", "oppor tunities.<<<SECTION_BREAK>>>\nBreaking Down Analytics\nThe first part of analytics is to make sure we\u2019re capturing the right metrics.\nIdentify the key success metric supporting your goal and the metrics that\nsupport that goal. If your success metric is how engaged your customers are,\nyou should track how often they complete the core \u201csuccess\u201d action and the\nsteps that lead to it. If the right metrics aren\u2019t there, then your first task for\nthis iteration of the product-development life cycle is to implement analytics\nfor those metrics.\nOne common problem when you inherit an existing project is that a\nprevious, well-meaning PM has been recording every single possible metric.\nThis leads to data overload, and it can be very hard to sort out the useful\nmetrics from the irrelevant ones. If you find yourself in that situation, we\nrecommend doing an analytics audit and reassessing what data points you\u2019re\nrecording\u2014removing the irrelevant ones\u2014be fore using the data to make\ndecisions.\nThe next part is how we group metrics together so that we can spot trends\nand oppor tunities. There are three key ways: segmentation, cohort analysis,\nand funnels.\nAnalytics track every customer equally and report the average behavior.\nFor example, a new customer will use an app\u2019s first-use tutorial\u2014some\nmight skip it\u2014but a returning customer won\u2019t even see the first-use tutorial.\nIf you simply looked at how often a customer views the tutorial out of how\nmany times people use the app, it\u2019d look like very few people use the tutorial\noverall. It\u2019s up to you to segment your data, which means grouping it by\ncommon characteristics.", "Analytics tools often provide multiple ways to segment data. Common\nchoices range from technical grouping (OS, browser, etc.) to behavioral\n(new/returning user) to demographics (country/language are common). After\nsegmenting data, we can look at each metric, focusing on our key success\nmetric and the supporting metrics, and see if it\u2019s in line with our baseline\nexpectation. If it\u2019s not, we\u2019ll flag this as a metric to focus on.\nYou might find something surprising for a metric unrelated to what you\u2019re\nworking on right now. Feel free to note it for later, but don\u2019t worry about it\ninitially. There are lots of metrics for a product, and PMs can always find\nsurprises. We\u2019re focused on a specific success metric and the supporting\nmetrics that lead to that success metric.\nAnother way of grouping data is cohor t analysis. This is very similar to\nsegmentation, but it uses a point in time as a key characteristic of the group\nand is often used to look at behavior over time. For example, imagine your\nproduct\u2019s featured on TV\u2019s Shar k Tank\u2014Dragon\u2019 s Den in the UK\u2014where\nhopeful entrepreneurs pitch their idea to investors. You might want to\ncompare how users who signed up before Shar k Tank aired use the product\ncompared to people who sign up later. And you\u2019d also ask how those\ncohorts\u2019 usage compares after two months, after six months, etc. Or, more\npractically, what\u2019s customer engagement like over time with customers from\nbefore you created the first-use tutorial compared to customers who signed\nup after you implemented the tutorial? If you see a substantial difference in\nbehavior at a certain point, flag that metric.\nThe last common method of grouping data is a funne l. This is when you\nmeasure key steps along a user\u2019s journey towards some task and group them\ntogether, in journey order. Typically a lot of people complete the first step\nand far fewer complete the last; e.g., many people might go to an Amazon", "product page, a smaller number click Add to Cart, and a smaller number still\ncomplete the checkout. \u201cLeakage\u201d is when a customer stops moving forward\nin the funnel.\nNearly any sequential-action group of metrics (workflow) can form a\nfunnel, and your goal is always to look at how a user goes from initiating to\ncompleting an action. Not every customer enters your product the same way\n(e.g., tapping an app on the home screen to open it the first time, opening the\napp for the tenth time with a restored state, tapping a link that opens the app,\netc.). Your analytics tool likely has a behavior flow report to see how users\nenter the funnel and where they go. Any place there\u2019s a substantial undesired\nfalloff is a potential oppor tunity, and you should flag that particular metric.\nDave McClure, the well-known venture capitalist who founded 500\nStartups, put together a talk called \u201cStartup Metrics for Pirates,\u201d where he\ncame up with a general approach to metrics for an entire product, called\nAARRR metrics\u2014although he put it together for startups, where the success\nof a company depends on one product, it\u2019s useful for any product. The\nacronym stands for the following:\nAcquisition: How the user comes to your product.\nActivation: The user\u2019s first visit to your product and her first happy\nexperience.\nRetention: The user liked your product enough to use it again (and\nhopefully again and again\u2026).\nReferral: The user likes it enough to tell someone about it.\nRevenue: The user finds your product valuable enough that she pays\nfor it.", "McClure suggests breaking down the key behavioral steps for your product\ninto these buckets (each bucket might have more than one metric within it)\nand using this funnel to see how users go from discovering your product to\nbeing willing to pay. Each large dip is a potential oppor tunity and a metric to\nflag, and the ones towards the top of  the funnel are the ones to address first.\nNote that the part(s) of the funnel you focus on will depend on your\ncompany and product goals. If your current goal is growth, you\u2019d focus on the\nactivation step rather than the revenue step.\nIt\u2019s also important to note that not every dip in a funnel is bad. For example,\nthe Nigerian spam emails asking you to provide your bank account to a\nprince (or something similar) have only a 0.1%  click-through rate\u2014meaning\nonly 0.1%  of the people who receive it click the Send Money link. But this\nturns out to be an excellent filter for gullible customers, as 70% of the people\nwho click the link actually send money. If they optimized the click-through\nrate and 90% of people clicked the link, it\u2019s more likely that the site would\nbe reported or taken dow n, and the spammer would make less money overall.\nIt\u2019s also reasonable to combine segmentation and cohort analysis and\nfunnels. For example, you might want to look at a funnel with cohort analysis\nif your product were featured on Shar k Tank. You could track how many\npeople went from clicking the checkout button to completing the purchase\nbefore you went on Shar k Tank, compared to how many people complete the\ncheckout funnel after you were on TV.\nUltimately, no matter how you look at your analytics, your goal is to find a\nmetric you believe is worth improving in order to achieve your product and\ncompany goals.<<<SECTION_BREAK>>>\nTurning Metrics into Opportunities by Asking Why", "The challenge with quantitative sources like metrics is that they tell you what\nis happening but not why. Once you\u2019ve identified a metric\u2014or two\u2014that you\nwant to improve, how do you figure out what to do? There are a few ways to\nfigure out what you should do, and one of the easiest is by asking \u201cwhy.\u201d\nSpecifically, ask yourself why you think the metric isn\u2019t where you want it to\nbe. And if the answer isn\u2019t a hypothesis that you can test somehow, continue\nto ask yourself why until you get to a specific hypothesis. Your goal is to get\nto the core problem, the root of the deeper issue. You want to solve\nproblems, not address symptoms. Asking why can help you find that core\nproblem, leading you to the potential oppor tunity to focus on validating.\nHere are a few ideas to help you. First, many people only focus on the end\nresult of the funnel. They might say, \u201cNot enough customers complete a\npurchase.\u201d If this is the case, ask yourself why. Look back up through the\nfunnel and see where the leakage occurs. Then, ask why it\u2019s occurring there.\nYou might need to go to that particular part of the product to see what might\nbe blocking a user.\nSegmenting your audience and focusing in on how each segment behaves\ncan lead to a better hypothesis. For example, perhaps your site\u2019s conversion\nrate looks low overall, but when you segment it by browser, you see the\nconversion rate for Safari customers is much higher than for Chrome\ncustomers. Given there are more Chrome customers than Safari ones, the\noverall average conversion rate appears low. As you ask yourself why and\ntry using the site in Chrome yourself, maybe you\u2019ll find a bug where a\nJavaScript error appears when you click Checkout in Chrome. Your\noppor tunity hypothesis is that fixing this bug will improve acquisition for the\nshopping cart page, and eventually increase revenue.\nHere are a few common, interesting oppor tunities you\u2019ll find for mobile and", "web apps in metrics:\nA low time on a screen and a high bounce rate\u2014pe ople who leave\nafter viewing this content\u2014on  a page that\u2019s suppos ed to be important\nlikely indicates a mismatch between expectations and reality. The\ncontent wasn\u2019t what the customers expected, so they left.\nA long time on a screen and a high bounce rate could be fine if the\npage is a long article, but if it\u2019s a page with very little content but lots\nof links, it could indicate the screen is unclear.\nA high number of screen views could indicate that this part of the app\nis important, therefore you need to opt imize it well.\nA low number of views could mean this section is hard to find.<<<SECTION_BREAK>>>\nIntercom\u2019s Feature Audit\nA company called Intercom, which makes tools to let product owners see\nwho\u2019s using their product and communicate with them, has put together a\nnumber of great resources on its blog, Inside Intercom, at blog.intercom.io.\nOne of the techniques Intercom shares is a way to look at your metrics and\nspot oppor tunities, called a feature audit.\nIn a feature audit, you start by creating a graph of how many people use a\nfeature on the x-axis vs. how often they use it (See Table 3-1). When doing\nthis, make sure to exclude \u201cadministrative\u201d features such as password\nrecovery, as they\u2019ll skew the result. The core value of your product, the\nreason it exists and people buy it, should be at the top right (Feature C)\nbecause everyone should use it all the time.", "Few peopleSome peopleMost peopleAll people\nAll the timeFeature A Feature C\nMost of the time Feature B\nSome of the time Feature D\nVery little of the timeFeature E\nTable 3-1. A sample Intercom feature audit table.\nThere are four sources of oppor tunity:\n1. Features on the top left of the graph are poorly adopted (Feature A in\nTable 3-1): very few people use them a lot. Sometimes that\u2019s OK\u2014\nfor example, if it\u2019s a niche feature for one key customer in an\nenterprise product that only that company uses\u2014bu t often, you\u2019ll want\nto improve adoption of these features.\n2. The second source is a feature that all the people use occasionally\n(Feature D): is it something you want people to use more often?\n3. The third is that perhaps you should kill a feature if it\u2019s something in\nthe bottom left that very few people use, and then only infrequently\n(Feature E).\n4. Last, you might choose to improve a key feature that many people use\nfrequently (Features B & C).\nThis view also shows a possible warning sign: if your product has only one\nfeature that people use frequently, you\u2019re easily replaceable in their\nworkflow. Ideally you\u2019ll have a few key features that people use frequently so\nthat you\u2019re not a throwaway product when something better in one area comes\nalong.\nIf there\u2019s an important feature you believe is for all customers but only some\ncustomers use, you\u2019ll want to improve its adoption. To do so, focus on asking", "why, just like we discussed before. Note that you want to be very explicit\u2014\ndon\u2019t just say, \u201ccustomers don\u2019t see its value.\u201d Keep asking why until you get\nto the root cause. Why don\u2019t they see its value? The feature doesn\u2019t save them\ntime. Why doesn\u2019t it save them time? There are too many steps to use the\nfeature. Why are there too many steps? Eventually, you\u2019ll come up with a list\nof issues preventing customers from adopting the feature (e.g., time saving\nmight be only one of many reasons a customer doesn\u2019t see a feature\u2019s value).\nOnce you\u2019ve done this you can focus on resolving those issues. Not all\noppor tunities will be code changes, either. It\u2019s possible different marketing or\ndesign will help adoption.\nIf there\u2019s a feature that many customers use infrequently but you think would\nbe beneficial if they used it more, it\u2019s possible users aren\u2019t clear how it\nworks, which you can check via a funnel. You can also check the value, with\nthe help of Marketing. To motivate users to use it more, you can use the Hook\nCanvas, by Nir Eyal, author of Hooked, to help create habits in your software.\nSeen in Figure 3-2, the Hook Canvas has four elements. First is the trigger\u2014\nwhat happens to get the user to the product? Second\u2014w hat\u2019s the absolute\nsimplest thing you can get a customer to do that will give them the reward?\nThird\u2014w hat reward can you provide that\u2019s fulfilling and makes the user want\nmore and invest in the product? Last, what tiny bit of action can you get the\ncustomer to invest in doing that will lead to more triggers and get them to\nreturn?", "Figure 3-2. Nir Eyal\u2019s Hook Canvas and its four phases.\nIf you\u2019ve heard of gamification, which involves adding gaming mechanisms\nto non-game products, you\u2019ve seen the Hook Canvas in action. You might get\nan email from an airline saying you\u2019ll get bonus points if you sign up for a\ncredit card. You fill out the simplest form the airline can give you, and\u2014\nassuming you\u2019re approved\u2014y ou get enough points for a free domestic trip.\nThat makes you want to earn more points to get more free trips.\nEyal uses Pinterest as an example in Figure 3-3.\nFigure 3-3. Pinterest\u2019s Hook Canvas, by Nir Eyal.\nSurveys\nAnother way of gathering data to find oppor tunities is by sending out surveys,", "trying to gauge user satisfaction with different parts of your product amongst\nstatistically significant parts of your user base. In Chapter 2 we discussed the\nmost common high-level approach to determining satisfaction, a Net Promoter\nScore (NPS). Again, it\u2019s simply the question, \u201con a scale of 1\u201310, how likely\nis it that you would recommend [brand] to a friend or colleague?\u201d Higher\nscores mean customers are happy and lower scores mean they\u2019re likely to be\nneutral or tell people not to buy your product.\nIt\u2019s good to dive in beyond a general NPS and ask how satisfied customers\nare with specific parts of your product. If they\u2019re less than a 10, h ave an open-\nended question for feedback about how the product isn\u2019t meeting their needs\nand expectations. As you make changes to the product, you can resurvey to see\nhow satisfaction changes over time.\nSome products now are integrating this satisfaction survey into the product.\nFor example, random Twitter customers will see a tweet in their timeline\nsaying they\u2019ve been selected for a survey, and tools like Intercom\n(http://intercom.io), Delighted (http://delighted.com), and UserVoice\n(http://uservoice.com) can be easily integrated and allow customers to\nprovide feedback continuously.\nSurveys can be used to gather more specific data, and we\u2019ll cover crafting\ngood ones in more depth in Chapter 4, when we look at how to use them to\nvalidate our hypothesis.\nObviously, if a customer isn\u2019t satisfied and tells you why, that\u2019s a potential\nsource of an oppor tunity hypothesis. But there are other ways to use survey\ndata to find an opportunity, especially creating an importance vs. satisfaction\ngraph.\nInternally, you should have a sense of how important each feature is to the\nproduct. The features that are core to the product and used most often are", "likely the most important. For each feature, if you create a graph (See Figure\n3-4) with customer satisfaction on the y-axis, increasing feature importance on\nthe x-axis, and an y=x line, you\u2019ll easily spot oppor tunities. An important\nfeature that has low satisfaction will appear below the line, and it should be\nyour first priority to improve.\nFigure 3-4. A graph showing satisfaction, with values gathered via survey, vs. feature importance, as\ndetermined internally. Feature A, with a very low satisfaction, will likely be the first place to focus,\ninstead of Feature B, which is more important but has a moderate satisfaction.\nGenerally, you\u2019ll trade off importance vs. how unsatisfied customers are, so\nyou might work on something that\u2019s fairly important with very low satisfaction\n(Feature A in Figure 3-4) before focusing on a feature that\u2019s very important\nwith moderate satisfaction (Feature B). Also, it\u2019s fine if less important\nfeatures have lower overall satisfaction; they\u2019re not critical to the product.\nShould those features become more important, then you should focus on\nimproving them so that the user satisfaction stays above  the x=y line.<<<SECTION_BREAK>>>\nWhat About Customer Interviews?", "It\u2019s possible that while you\u2019re talking to customers, for example, while user\ntesting another feature, they might say something that sparks an idea in your\nmind. However, we believe that customer interviews should not be the source\nof your first opportunity hypothesis. If you start customer interviews without\neven a vague sense of what you\u2019re looking to learn, the interviews will be\nunfocused and not useful, and you\u2019re unlikely to find a good h ypothesis.\nInstead, we believe you should start with an oppor tunity hypothesis, even if\nit\u2019s vague, and then do customer interviews to validate it. It\u2019s possible that\nwhile doing those interviews, you\u2019ll come up with a new hypothesis, and\nthat\u2019s fine.<<<SECTION_BREAK>>>\nQUALITATIVELY FINDING AN EDUCATED\nOPPORTUNITY HYPOTHESIS\nNot every oppor tunity arises from something that can be quantified and\nmeasured. As Henry Ford suppos edly said, \u201cIf I had asked people what they\nwanted, they would\u2019ve said a faster horse.\u201d Someone else once said that\n\u201cdata-driven optimization taken to its extreme just leads to por n.\u201d\nYou can pull from a wide range of qualitative sources to find opportunities.\nThe biggest challenge is that these will take more work to validate than\nquantitatively found oppor tunities, as they don\u2019t come directly from data:\nyou\u2019ll have to find data to support them.\nKnown Bugs and Sugs\nThe simplest qualitative iterative oppor tunity (which is also arguably\nquantitative) to look for is how a bug might be blocking customers from\nsucceeding. For example, if you\u2019re trying to improve revenue and the QA\nteam discovers that when customers in Europe try to pay, your app crashes\nwhile handling the US-dollar-to-euro rate conversion, then the next thing you", "might choose to work on is fixing that crashing bug.\nThe main way you\u2019ll validate a bug-related oppor tunity hypothesis is by\nlooking for data about how big of an issue the bug is\u2014i.e., how often does it\noccur and what impact does it have on the success metric? Maybe that\nconversion bug hasn\u2019t been reported by any actual users, and it\u2019s really\nsomething in the QA team\u2019s setup causing it. Or, if only a tiny portion of your\ncustomers are in Europe, then there are likely other ways to improve revenue\nyou should focus on first.\nIt might seem silly to explicitly list bugs as an oppor tunity to explore\u2014if\nyou\u2019re an engineer, you\u2019d likely prefer to have no bugs\u2014bu t one of a PM\u2019s\nchallenges is to weigh the overall value of fixing a bug against that of not\nfixing the bug and doing something else instead. Quality\u2019s always important,\nbut not every bug is a high enough priority to go fix immediately.\nSimilarly, there might be existing \u201csugs\u201d or feature requests in your backlog,\nwhich become the basis for your hypothesis. These might have come from a\nvariety of places, ranging from random ideas people have had to data-driven\nsources like customer support tickets and insights from usability studies\u2014\ni.e., studies where you test how real customers interact with the existing\nproduct/feature and note what they do well and what stumbling blocks they\nencounter.\nRelated to this is paying off \u201ctechnical debt.\u201d Sometimes engineering has to\nmake internal changes that essentially \u201cdo the dishes\u201d in the code. It\u2019s\nimportant to periodically prioritize this engineering work because if you\ndon\u2019t, it will become harder and harder to implement new features down the\nroad. Unfortunately, when you work on these projects, from a customer\nperspective nothing changes. To validate this oppor tunity, you\u2019ll want to make\nsure that this is a good time to work on an internal cleanup rather than to", "deliver something new to customers, and that this internal cleanup will\nprovide value to your team down the road, such as making it easier to\nimplement another oppor tunity on the roadmap.<<<SECTION_BREAK>>>\nIntuition\nHow many times have you heard someone say, \u201cI\u2019ve got an idea for an app!\nDo you know anyone who can build it for me?\u201d Sometimes there are good\nideas, like being able to use an app to easily hail a car at an attractive price.\nOther times someone wants to build an app to help match their socks to their\ntrousers. Clearly, no one has good ideas all the time, not even Steve Jobs\u2014\nremember the iPod Sock?\nA common source of oppor tunity hypotheses is existing hypotheses you or\nyour company might already have based on your experience/prior knowledge.\nThis is a great place to start because you likely do have a strong idea of what\nto build for your customers from your experience, but it\u2019s also potentially\ndangerous because this type of hypothesis often doesn\u2019t get validated\nproperly. Many times, people are afraid of someone stealing their idea\u2014\nwhich rarely actually happens\u2014or they just don\u2019t want to find out that no one\nactually wants their idea.\nUnfortunately, the second step for many first-time product builders isn\u2019t to\nvalidate their idea but rather to jump immediately into building it. People like\nto assume that if they have a problem, many other people do too, and these\npeople will want their solution. This is risky because it might be very costly\nto build the product, and no one knows for sure if anyone else experiences this\nsame problem or is interested in the same solution as they are.\nThe best way to come up with an idea on your own is not to think about what\nyou the individual want but to really empathize with your target personas,", "combining your knowledge of your customers\u2019 pain points with your\nknowledge of what you could build and the overall goals and success metrics\nthat matter to the product and the company. As a PM, you\u2019re in a unique\nposition to know what the major pain points for customers are, how they\u2019re\nreacting to your product, what the technical issues are with your product, and\nwhat technical innovations have occurred within your engineering team. We\u2019ll\nshow you a tool, shortly, called the Business Model Canvas, to make the\nsynthesis of this idea more concrete. A great PM will also be paying attention\nto the broader tech world, thinking about how innovations elsewhere might\napply to his product and customers.\nHere\u2019s a simple example of an intuition-derived hypothesis for Moove r.\nThey want to make book ing a move as easy as calling an Uber, so that means\nmaking it simple for moving companies to provide accurate estimates. Photos\ncould help moving companies make accurate estimates, but people likely\ndon\u2019t know how to take useful photos to show a space for moving companies.\nWhat if they added a feature where we had the customer stand in the middle of\neach room, slowly moving their camera up/down as the customer spun around,\ngenerating a 360\u00b0  photo on screen? That way every customer takes a good\nphoto of the space in question.\nWe can hypothesize that the result will make it easier for moving companies\nto give an accurate estimate. The next step would be to validate that photos,\nespecially 360\u00b0  ones, make it substantially easier for moving companies to\nmake accurate estimates. This could be done by using an existing 360\u00b0  app to\ntake photos of a space and send both them and regular photos of a space to\nvarious moving companies, asking for their feedback.\nVision", "You, your boss, your company, etc., likely have an overall vision for your\nproducts and the company that you want to achieve on a longer time horizon.\nSpecifically, it\u2019s an image of the future version of the company you\u2019re trying\nto create. For Walt Disney, this meant looking at some land in Florida and\nhaving a vision of Disney World, knowing that everything he wanted to do\nnext would be about building Cinderella\u2019s castle. For you, maybe you want to\nmigrate from a locally deployed-at-clients solution to a cloud-based one.\nYou\u2019ll need to take steps along the way to achieve this long-term vision, and\nyou might choose to make one of these steps your next oppor tunity. As an\naside, hopefully someone has done some validation on the overall vision!\nThe challenge with these oppor tunities is assessing whether you can provide\nan immediate value to customers or if it\u2019s delayed gratification. If you believe\nthis opportunity will have an immediate benefit, validate it like any other\noppor tunity. But if it\u2019s something that will take longer for customers to benefit\nfrom, you might only do some internal validation to ensure it makes sense to\nwork on this project right now since it takes resources away from other\nprojects.<<<SECTION_BREAK>>>\nTeam Ideas\nOne of a PM\u2019s biggest challenges is a soft skill, soft power. No one reports to\na PM: you can\u2019t tell people what to do. Instead you need to earn people\u2019s\ntrust, and a great way to do that is to look at building a product as a team sport\nand not departments working in silos. No, it\u2019s not a democracy, and at the end\nof the day you\u2019ll often be the one making calls about a product. But if other\npeople know you listened to and acted upon their input, they\u2019ll feel included\nin the decision-making process and happier with your decisions.\nA great place to include other teams is in this ideation step. There are likely", "other teams that work closely with the customers, such as Design, Customer\nSupport, Business Development, and Sales. Reach out to people on those\nteams and see what thoughts they\u2019ve had based on their experience with\ncustomers and the product. Support teams especially appreciate this, as they\nspend all day working with actual customers, and they have great visibility\ninto what the customers are doing with the product and saying about it. They\noften can provide data like support tickets to back up their ideas.\nBeyond talking directly with other teams, you can organize a group\nbrainstorming session. There are pros and cons to these sessions. A big pro is\nthat many people feel included, and one idea might inspire someone else to\nbuild upon it with a different idea. For example, the sales team might make\none feature request that they think would help the product sell better, and the\nsupport team might mention there are a lot of tickets around that entire feature\nset, so perhaps it should be completely redone.\nA big downside to group brainstorming is that people often fixate on a few\nideas or ways of thinking, missing other oppor tunities. As the group\nfacilitator, you need to help get the creative juices flowing. One way to do t hat\nis to have everyone share the worst ideas they can think of, then figure out\nways to make those ideas even worse. After you\u2019ve done that, flip over and\nfocus on how to make the product better.\nMake sure to keep these sessions at least a little focused by listing your\ncurrent product goals and success metrics. If you want to brainstorm ideas to\nincrease engagement, for example, you\u2019re not going to want to talk about\nputting more ads in the product.<<<SECTION_BREAK>>>\nR&D\nRelated to teamwork, sometimes there are new inventions that a brilliant", "engineer, or team of engineers, creates. What\u2019s nice about these inventions is\nthat there\u2019s usually a prototype of some form so that you can see it in action.\nAdding these inventions to the product\u2014called produc tizing\u2014is often how\nproducts are pushed into the next generation, and they can be a major source\nof customer delight because the customer didn\u2019t expect or ask for them.\nHowever, it can often be a rocky road from prototype to product, and the\ninitial product might have significant tradeoffs or limitations. If you choose to\npursue an oppor tunity like this, make sure to work closely with Engineering to\nunderstand all the challenges you\u2019ll need to solve to make this prototype\nuseful to customers in their daily lives.<<<SECTION_BREAK>>>\nThe Competition\nStravinsky, Faulkner, Picasso\u2026regardless of who said it, you might have\nheard the quote, \u201cGood artists copy. Great artists steal.\u201d Sometimes your\ncompetition has a great idea, and stealing it\u2014and making it better\u2014is your\noppor tunity.\nBe careful with this source. \u201cBecause the other guy did it\u201d is never a valid\nreason alone to create a feature\u2014that\u2019s just copying. First of all, how do you\nknow the competition is smart, and isn\u2019t making a mistake with this feature?\nYou\u2019ll also want to make sure this feature/product fits within your company\u2019s\ncontext. Furthermore, you want to think about where the puck\u2019s going to be,\nrather than where it is right now. If you\u2019re always stealing, you\u2019ll never be\nahead. But the benefit to this source is that you can see how the feature works\nin real life, how customers react to it, and what you\u2019d like to do di fferently.\nHere\u2019s a simple example: For years, many PC manufacturers made stripped-\ndown, slow, small-keyboard, low-cost \u201cnetbook s,\u201d and many analysts kept\ncalling for Apple to make one. Yet Apple prefers high-quality, high-margin", "products, and instead of doing what everyone else was doing and what\nanalysts thought Apple should do, it created the MacBook Air (which was\nincredibly small yet had a full-sized keyboard) and eventually the iPad. Both\nleveraged Apple\u2019s strengths, both were loved by customers, and both had the\nmargins Apple aims to keep. As of writing, netbook s are dead, and many PC\nmanufacturers have created their own MacBook Air and iPad knockoffs.<<<SECTION_BREAK>>>\nBusiness Model and Value Proposition Canvases\nAnother way to create an oppor tunity hypothesis is to explicitly analyze how a\nproduct fits into a business and how the product provides value for the\ncustomer. Alexander Osterwalder and Yves Pigneur created two tools to help\nyou determine those elements, the Business Model Canvas, and the newer\nValue Propos ition Canvas, respectively. They also have two book s, with the\nsame titles as the tools themselves, that do a great job explaining these tools\nin more depth than we cover. Using these tools to look at your product, you\nmight see a missing link that lets you think up an oppor tunity.\nBusiness Model Canvas\nThe Business Model Canvas provides a way to look at all aspects of your\ncompany with a different framing than we showed in Chapter 2. It\u2019s very\nfocused on people, values, and revenue, and filling it out requires you to list\nfacts and hypotheses (e.g., \u201cWe believe these people will be distribution\npartners\u201d). This tool was originally developed for a startup with one product,\nbut it works for a product within a large company, too. Figure 3-5 shows this\ncanvas, and you can find a version to print and fill out at\nhttp://strategyzer.com.", "Figure 3-5. The Business Model Canvas provides a way to look at all aspects of your product.\nHere\u2019s what each block covers:\nKey partners: Who are the people outside the company , from suppliers to\ncontractors, who make the business model work? What key resources do\nwe get from them and what key activities do they perform? Companies\nrarely do everything themselves, and working with partners lets you reduce\nrisk and optimize your activities. There are generally three types of\npartnerships: alliances between non-competitors, strategic partnerships\nbetween competitors, and joint ventures to build something new.\nKey activities: What are the tasks a company  must do well to deliver on\nits value? For example, Apple owns a number of key activities: software\ndevelopment, supply-chain management, store management/distribution, and\nmore. Samsung\u2019s phone unit is focused more on supply-chain management", "and software development.\nKey resources: What are the most important physical, financ ial,\nintellectual (patents, copyrights, etc.), or human resources the company\nneeds to succeed? They can be owned or leased. For many companies\nmaking hardware, human and intellectual resources are key, whereas\nmanufacturing is outsourced to an Asian partner.\nValue propositions: What\u2019s the benefit/value that a certain group of your\nproduc ts or services provides for a given persona? What customer pain\npoints are you solving? The Value Propos ition Canvas will dig into this\nmore, too.\nCustomer relationships: What type of relationship, from personal to\nautomated, do you want to establish with each persona?  For example, a\nhigh-value customer might have a direct email for an account manager\nwhereas the average customer might only have online support forums\navailable. Also consider what each segment expects, what you have now,\nhow costly each relationship is, and how you expect to maintain each\nrelationship.\nChannels: How does the company  reach each persona to deliver the value,\nincluding marketing, communication, distribution, sales, and suppor t?\nHow are you reaching them now? What works best? How are the channels\nintegrated, for example, are sales only via your website?\nCustomer segments: Who are the key personas  the company /produc t will\nserve? These are the most important personas that you believe you\u2019ll create\nthe most value for, and they\u2019re who you want to prioritize oppor tunities for.", "The Value Propos ition Canvas will dive into this more.\nCost structure: Where do your costs come from? This breaks down into\nfixed costs (salaries, rents, utilities) and variable costs (equipment\npurchases). For many companies, human resources are the greatest expense\nbecause people are needed to do key activities so that the businesses can\ndeliver your value to their personas.\nRevenue streams: This represents the company\u2019s incoming cash\u2014revenue\nminus costs is the company\u2019s earnings. A company might have multiple\nrevenue streams, depending on its customer segments, and asking what value\nyou deliver that each customer segment will pay for, what they currently pay,\nand how they\u2019d prefer to pay\u2014e.g., lower recurring fee vs. higher one-time\nfee\u2014helps you determine how to monetize each segment. For example, some\ncompanies offer discounted \u201cHome\u201d editions of their products, which lack\nfeatures that matter at work such as document collaboration that aren\u2019t useful\nin an average household. The \u201cHome\u201d edition is one revenue stream and the\nregular version is another.<<<SECTION_BREAK>>>\nThe Business Model Canvas is great because it lets us write down all of our\nhypotheses, from oppor tunity to distribution, in one place. Using the Business\nModel Canvas alone, it takes some deep thought to find a great oppor tunity\nhypothesis. Fortunately, the Canvas\u2019s authors have developed a newer tool,\nthe Value Propos ition Canvas (Figure 3-6), also available at\nhttp://strategyzer.com, which drills down into the Value Propos itions and\nCustomer Segments blocks to really identify how the product is or isn\u2019t\nproviding value to the customers, and what the customers\u2019 needs are.", "Figure 3-6. The Value Proposition Canvas is focused on the interaction between the customer and the\nproduct, and poorly met or unmet customer needs are a possible product opportunity.\nThe goal of the Value Propos ition Canvas is to help you achieve\nproduct/market fit. This phrase simply means that \u201ca good number of\ncustomers want what you\u2019re selling.\u201d This concept is especially important to\nstartups building their initial product, as startups need to find customers as\nsoon as possible. If they fail to find customers, they either need to pivot the\nbusiness to focus on new customers, possibly even with a new product, or\nthey need to close the business. This also applies to new features in existing\nproducts. After all, you want to build a feature a good number of customers\nwill use.\nThe first part of the Value Propos ition Canvas is diving into the customer\u2014\ncompleting this part of the canvas can help you refine your personas! There\nare three key aspects to the Customer side: jobs, gains, and pains.", "Customer jobs are simply the things the customers are trying to get done, in\ntheir own words, be it a task they\u2019re trying to perform, a problem they\u2019re\ntrying to solve, or a need they want to satisfy. For example, an Apple Watch\nowner is likely interested in easily tracking her fitness\u2014a task\u2014and looking\nstylish\u2014a need. Customers might have multiple jobs, and not all jobs have the\nsame weight. If you ever heard someone say, \u201cFashion over function,\u201d that\nperson\u2019s choosing a social job\u2014l ooking trendy\u2014ove r the actual task.\nCustomer jobs align nicely with product use cases.\nGains are the outcomes the customer wants to achieve, in his own words.\nThey might be expected, and either required or desired, or surprising, ideally\nin a positive way. Gains aren\u2019t just from functional utility: they might provide\nsocial value (This makes me look cool!), illicit positive emotions (I love this\nproduc t!), or save money (This is 1/10th the price!). When talking with\ncustomers about the gains they want, make things as concrete as possible. If\nthe customer says, \u201cIt needs to be fast\u201d find out what \u201cfast\u201d means. 1 second?\n10 seconds? 10 m inutes?\nLast, we have pains. These describe the obstacles preventing the customer\nfrom completing the jobs, along with possible bad outcomes and risks. Just\nlike gains, try to make these concrete. If the customer says waiting for a taxi is\na waste, ask how many minutes it takes until it feels like it\u2019s a waste. Also try\nto gauge how bad each pain actually is. Waiting 10 m inutes for a taxi is a pain,\nbut does it stop you from trying to hail a cab or getting in once it arrives?\nThe second piece of the Value Propos ition Canvas is your product(s), and it\nalso has three aspects: products and services, gain creators, and pain\nrelievers.\nProducts and services are fairly straightforward: What are the produc ts and\nservices available for each persona/customer segment?", "Gain creators refers to how your products and services create benefits and\noutcomes the customer wants, whether those are required, desired, or\nsurprising. Again, these gains might be functional, problem solving, or social\n(including cost savings).\nPain relievers are how your product addresses the customer\u2019s top pains. You\ndon\u2019t have to address every pain, but it should be clear in the Canvas how\nyour product addresses the key pains.\nPain relievers and gain creators are the parts of your product that create\nvalue for the customer segment. The goal of the Value Propos ition Canvas is\nto make these two categories\u2014to make this value creation\u2014explicit. If it\u2019s\nunclear or a piece is missing, you likely have a great oppor tunity to improve\nyour product.\nAt the end of the day, product/market fit or feature/market fit comes down to\naddressing the key customer gains and pains successfully. If the customer\nwants important gains that you don\u2019t provide or has a big pain point you don\u2019t\naddress, those mismatches create a very good oppor tunity for you to improve\nyour product.\nAlso note that some products, especially B2B products, might have multiple\npersonas, so you will need multiple Value Propos ition Canvases, one for each\npersona.\nAs you work to validate your oppor tunity and learn more, redo your\nBusiness Model and Value Propos ition Canvases to incorporate the new\ninformation. You might even want to specifically call out what\u2019s validated and\nwhat\u2019s still a hypothesis.<<<SECTION_BREAK>>>\nExternal Factors\nWhile all of the ways to create an oppor tunity hypothesis so far give us", "educated, good hypotheses, sometimes there are external factors\u2014shall we\nsay\u2014that force an oppor tunity.\nThe simplest and most understandable one is when a good business\noppor tunity arises. For example, maybe a partner offers a large contract if a\ncertain feature is added to the product within a given timeframe. It\u2019s likely\nstill up to the PM to make sure this feature\u2019s worth it\u2014usually by measuring\nthe cost of adding the feature vs. the value of the contract\u2014bu t this type of\narrangement will often take priority over the previous plans.\nNext, sometimes in regulated industries, regulations change and you have to\nprioritize complying with those regulations or your product might be pulled\nfrom sale.\nThe last qualitative method is also the most frustrating. It\u2019s when your boss\nor someone above you says, \u201cJust do this.\u201d A good leader will have a\nreasoning behind the demand or even be willing to change her mind if you\nprovide proof it\u2019s an invalid oppor tunity, but not every leader is rational, and\nnot all rational leads are able to explain their thinking all the time. Sometimes\nyou just have to prioritize what your boss wants, even if it\u2019s not the best\noppor tunity.<<<SECTION_BREAK>>>\nUSING THE KANO MODEL TO FIND OPPORTUNITIES\nIn the 1980s , Professor Noriaki Kano created a framework to help teams\nuncover and classify three categories of customer needs/attributes. Looking at\nwhere your product falls can help you uncover oppor tunities to work on next\nbased on unaddressed or unspoken needs. Furthermore, it helps you assess if\ninvesting in your oppor tunity will provide a worthwhile return, helping you\ntransition into prioritizing your oppor tunities.\nThe Kano model defines three principles that a product needs to achieve to", "be successful over time:\n1. Value attracts customers.\n2. Quality keeps customers and builds loyalty.\n3. Innovation differentiates your product from others and keeps you\ncompetitive.\nThen it maps these principles into feature categories.\nBasic features. These are the things customers expect in a product, usually\nmapping to the value principle, and customers will be very unhappy if they\nare poorly executed or missing. Unfortunately, doing these really well won\u2019t\nmake your users happy\u2014it will just minimize their unhappiness. If you press\nthe gas pedal in your car all the way and the car barely moves, you\u2019ll be\nunhappy. If your car is missing the break pedal, you\u2019ll be very unhappy. If an\napp you have to log in to is missing a password-recovery feature, you\u2019ll be\nvery unhappy when you need it. If you have the fastest, most nicely designed\npassword-recovery feature of any app, your customers will not be\nsignificantly happier than if you had a basic recovery feature. Basic features\ncan be hard to identify when talking with customers, as customers expect\nthem to be there and won\u2019t explicitly mention them. How often do you look\nfor \u201ctoilet paper included\u201d when book ing an Airbnb? Generally you find out\nabout a lack of basic features from complaint systems, lost-customer\nsurveys, and attrition analysis.\nPerformance features (satisfiers). These are the things customers are often\njudging your app by and the things they look for before purchasing. Your\ncustomer\u2019s satisfaction with these features will be proportional to how well", "you execute them. These are fairly easy to find information about by talking\nwith customers, be it through interviews or surveys, because they\u2019re things a\ncustomer will often explicitly ask for, compliment, or complain about. For\nexample, faster performance in an app leads to greater satisfaction. Having\nfewer steps to achieve a goal also increases satisfaction.\nExcitement features (delighters). These are the unexpected \u201cwow\u201d\nfeatures that become product differentiators, innovations, and unique selling\npoints, such as the iPhone\u2019s capacitive touch screen, Android\u2019s notification\npanel, or Wi-Fi on an airplane midflight. When you do these well they create\nsignificant excitement and delight. If they\u2019re missing, customers stay neutral:\nthey don\u2019t know what they\u2019re missing. These features are the hardest to\ndiscover and really require an understanding of customer need. They\u2019re\noften found only qualitatively.\nThese three feature categories are commonly graphed together (Figure 3-7) to\nshow how customer satisfaction compares to your level of\ninvestment/execution. It\u2019s a useful way to help judge how much effort you\nshould spend on various features, along with evaluating what feature\ncategories are worth focusing on next.<<<SECTION_BREAK>>>", "Figure 3-7. The Kano model provides a way to consider how much satisfaction each feature provides\ncompared to what type of feature it is and how well it\u2019s executed.\nOver time, each feature moves \u201cdown\u201d in its category. Excitement features\nbecome performance features, and performance features become basic needs.\nThe first time you had Wi-Fi on a flight, you were likely delighted to check\nyour email while flying. Now you likely expect planes to have Wi-Fi and are\ndisappointed when there\u2019s a poor  signal or no Wi-Fi.", "In general, the first version of your product needs to cover the basic features.\nEach successive generation should focus on a mix of satisfiers and delighters,\nalong with making sure you\u2019re continuing to cover the basic features.\nTo find feature opportunities using the Kano model, map your product and its\nfeatures against the model. What features are about meeting basic\nexpectations? Are they meeting expectations? Have you covered all the\nbasics? If so, move on to a satisfier or a delighter.\nA big frustration for product managers is that basic features can require a\nsignificant investment to even get to a reasonable level. While you want to\nspend your time working on the satisfiers and delighters, skipping the basic\nfeatures or doing them poorly will often lead to less customer satisfaction\neven if you have a great delighter feature.\nIf you\u2019re working on a new version of an existing product, consider what\nfeatures started as excitement features but are now expected and something the\ncompetition has, too. Or similarly, what\u2019s something the competition added\nthat your customers now also expect? How does that affect your feature\nmapping/oppor tunity hypothesis? Touch ID started as a delighter feature on\nthe iPhone, and now fingerprint unlocking is fairly common and expected on\nsmartphones. What new delighters can you find to achieve significant\ncustomer satisfaction?<<<SECTION_BREAK>>>\nMOOVER.IO\u2019S HYPOTHESIS\nBack in Chapter 2, we mentioned that when you book  a move with Moove r,\nthe moving company does a follow-up call to plan details. Based on\ncustomer-satisfaction surveys, it has been found that this is the thing that\ncurrent customers who give the company a lower NPS complain the most\nabout. Being a young business, Moove r has to balance growing the business", "against customer satisfaction.\nThe team did get together and brainstorm ideas, and the other possibility that\nemerged was some type of referral program to help with growth. But given\nhow infrequently moves happen overall, the team\u2019s decided to focus on\nmaking customers happier first. The idea is that happy customers will\nnaturally provide good word-of-mouth referrals, and later on if Moove r\ndoesn\u2019t have good e nough growth they can try various growth techniques.\nAfter looking at the satisfaction-survey results and the product workflow,\nthis is what they came up with:\nCompany goal : Improve customer satisfaction.\nProduct goal : Reduce friction in the current workflow.\nOpportunity hypothesis: We can improve satisfaction for Really\nBusy Rob if we eliminate phone calls with the moving companies and\nconsolidate communication into an in-app m essaging tool.\nSuccess metrics: Since customer satisfaction is our main goal, we\ncan measure it by tracking our NPS.\nOther key metrics: Other key factors that indicate if customers are\nachieving their goals and using this feature are the percentage of\ncustomers who complete the bid-to-completed-move funnel and the\nnumber of messages sent per customer.\nAt this point, as we did with Moover, you should have a hypothesis about the\nunmet customer need you want to address for your personas, an idea about\nwhy you fall short right now, the key metrics you want to improve, and,\npossibly, an idea of what you want to do to try to address this problem. All of\nthese elements should have some supporting evidence, even for blue-sky", "oppor tunities. Read on to learn about how to validate these oppor tunities and\nsee if they\u2019re worth pursuing.<<<SECTION_BREAK>>>\n________ \nCHAPTER THREE TIP\nThis tip is from Beatriz Datange l. Beatriz has worn several hats in the\nstartup world. She\u2019s used her analyst experiences to land produc t\nmanage ment positions where she drives decisions from data and insights.\nHer focus at Produc t School is on how  to use data and c ommunicate metrics\neffectively. You can reach out  to her via Twitter @bzdata.\nWHAT ARE THE KEY DIFFERENCES BETWEEN VANITY\nAND SUCCESS METRICS?\nIf you ask what makes a great product manager, many will say it\u2019s an understanding of what goes where\nand how\u2014not as simple when you\u2019re toggling between Excel spreadsheets, SQL queries, and visualized\ninfographics. We live in a time when data lives everywhere. A product manager should know how to\nextract insight from the right place. Let\u2019s look at how to do so, using Amazon as an example.\nStart by understanding the product\u2019s and the company\u2019s overall value proposition. For Amazon, the\nvalue proposition to customers is the convenience of buying anything and getting it quickly.\nAs a PM, you will need to think from the customer\u2019s perspective. If they chose your product/company\nout of all the competition for the key value proposition, you will need to know how parts of the product\nare performing to make sure the value proposition stays intact. What metrics do customers care about\nthat support the value proposition? These include:\nInventory of every item", "Number of items stocked with inventory compared to top lists/holiday shopping guides\nPercent of items ordered and arriving within an Amazon Prime shipping window (~48 hours)\nAverage load speed of the website\nAverage wait time between submission of a service ticket and resolution\nIf a website were slow or deliveries weren\u2019t on time, customers wouldn\u2019t necessarily think Amazon is\nconvenient. If we fail to deliver on the above metrics, we wouldn\u2019t deliver on our value proposition to\ncustomers, and they\u2019d shop elsewhere. Conversely, when we deliver on these metrics, customers are\nhappy. This means these are success metrics we should focus on.\nWell, what are vanity metrics, then? Eric Ries first spoke of vanity metrics in 2009, defining them as\nmetrics often spoken of at a top-level view. They also are often referred to in acronyms:\nPageviews\nNumber of installs\nDaily/monthly users (DAU)\nGrowth in users, installs, page views\nIt\u2019s great if lots of people look at Amazon each day and go to Amazon first, but if they don\u2019t complete\ntheir transactions on Amazon, then Amazon isn\u2019t winning. In other words, these metrics don\u2019t tell us if\nwe\u2019re making our customers happy or not.\nVanity numbers are great for a quick headline. However, success comes with context. Be sure to look\nfor metrics that matter towards a successful experience for the customer.<<<SECTION_BREAK>>>", "Now that we have an idea, we need to make sure it\u2019s the right thing to do next.\nEvery idea has an oppor tunity cost. Working on Feature A means you\u2019re not\nbuilding Feature B. The hallmark of an effective product manager is being\nable to sort out the great ideas from the merely good on es.\nContinuing our scientific method analogy, now that we have a hypothesis\nabout what to do next, we need to design and run an experiment to prove or\ndisprove our hypothesis. In other words, we want to validate whether our\nidea\u2014no matter how big or small\u2014will really help us achieve our goals.\nThe ideal experiment to validate our hypothesis would be to build the full\nproduct and see how our success metrics change. Sometimes this is the right", "thing to do, such as if your hypothesis is that fixing a bug or adding a small\nfeature will help you achieve your goals. But often, building the full product is\na big investment in both time and cost. This means it\u2019s very risky to always\nbuild the full product to see if it achieves its goals. Instead, companies have\nstarted adopting the lean principles we\u2019ve discussed, finding less expensive\nways to validate an idea before building the product.\nThese validation approaches take many forms. Some ideas need only\ninternal validation by looking at existing data like analytics and having a\ndiscussion with key stakeholders about the cost/benefit of this oppor tunity\nbefore you decide to pursue it or not.\nWith other ideas, especially for new products or major new features, you\u2019ll\nwant to talk with real customers, both current and potential, directly via\ninterviews and indirectly via surveys. This approach, called customer\ndevelopment, will help you understand your customers\u2019 pain points and goals\nmore thoroughly so that you can validate if your idea will address their needs.\nYou might even discover that a different idea many customers complain about\nis worth pursuing instead of your original hypothesis.\nThe last idea-validation method we\u2019ll cover is to run an actual experiment\nand seeing how your metrics change. For a new product or feature, you might\nchoose to build a low-cost minimum viable product (MVP, covered briefly in\nChapter 1). Don\u2019t confuse building an MVP with building the full product\u2014as\nwe\u2019ll cover later, MVPs might even be human-powered. Alternatively, if your\nidea is centered on changing a workflow, you might run an A/B test, which\nlets you compare two versions of something\u2014like two different sign-up\nworkflows\u2014to see which one achieves better success metrics.\nThe right way to validate your oppor tunity hypothesis depends on your\nspecific situation. In general, for each new idea you\u2019ll want to have objective", "data, anecdotal data, and cost/benefit data to be able to fully assess it. This\nmeans you\u2019ll have to do multiple types of validation. You might run an A/B\ntest to gather analytics data, determine the cost by talking with the engineering\nlead, and then have an internal discussion with key stakeholders about the\ncost/benefit. Just showing that the idea will achieve its goals, which an A/B\ntest can do, doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s the right thing to do if the product is very\nexpensive to build.\nLast, once you\u2019ve found and validated an idea, you need to assess where it\nfits on the roadmap. Just because you\u2019ve found a great oppor tunity doesn\u2019t\nmean it\u2019s the best thing for the company to work on next.\nPutting these ideas together with Moove r, how might you validate your idea\nabout how to improve customer satisfaction by building an in-app messaging\ntool? You already have data from an NPS survey, so focus your energy on\ndoing customer development, interviewing real and potential clients to gather\nanecdotal data and ensure you truly understand their needs and pain\npoints/how to make them more satisfied with Moove r. If those interviews\nindicate messaging really is the biggest pain point, then talk with Engineering\nand Design about what it will take to build an MVP of this feature, and if the\nteam agrees this will give the biggest business value for the cost, go build it.\nLet\u2019s dig into each of these validation methods in more detail.<<<SECTION_BREAK>>>\nSWOT ANALYSIS\nA SWOT analysis is a common method for looking at how an oppor tunity\nhypothesis fits in. SWOT stands for strengths, weaknesses, oppor tunities, and\nthreats. This framework helps you identify the most important internal and\nexternal elements of achieving your goals.\nTo do a SWOT analysis, first identify your key goals and success metrics.", "Then create a two-by-two table like Table 4-1. The top row will be your\ninternal elements\u2014the strengths and weaknesses for the product/company\naround achieving your goals. The bottom row will look at external elements\u2014\nthe oppor tunities and threats, including things like cultural, governmental, and\ntechnological trends.\nStrengths: Internally focused view of what you excel atWeaknesses: Internally focused view of where you\nfall short\nOpportunities: Externally-focused view of what you\u2019re\npositioned well to go afterThreats: Externally focused view of factors that\njeopardize your stability\nTable 4-1. SWOT analysis provides a good way to put an opportunity in context at a high level, looking\nat both internal and external elements.\nIf your oppor tunity helps improve a specific strength, take advantage of an\noppor tunity. Or conversely if an oppor tunity limits or converts a weakness or\nthreat, it\u2019s likely worth pursuing even more. If it doesn\u2019t factor in or doesn\u2019t\naddress one of the top-priority items, it\u2019s likely not worth doing now.<<<SECTION_BREAK>>>\nINTERNAL VALIDATION\nAs a PM, you\u2019ll find that there\u2019s no shortage of good ideas for what to do\nnext. In an ideal world, we\u2019d do a comprehensive validation of each idea, but\nthis is rather impractical. Instead, we can do some preliminary internal\nvalidation to see if an idea is worth pursuing.\nHere\u2019s a checklist of questions that will help you start validating an\noppor tunity. If the answer to any of these is negative, then you should most\nlikely not pursue this oppor tunity.", "Is this oppor tunity in line with our  vision?\nDoes it suppor t the produc t\u2019s vision and c ore function?\nCan we do it well with our capabi lities (or is it feasible and\ndesirable to expand our  capabi lities to meet the oppor tunity)?\nHow does it contribute to our  key metrics?\nDo we have any data, be it from analytics, surveys, or bug reports,\nto suppor t this oppor tunity?\nIs it required to meet a critical business initiative?\nHow does it contribute to our  users\u2019 winning?\nIs it on our roadm ap for this year, even indirectly as part of\nsomething else?\nWill it matter in two years? (It\u2019s OK if the feature is to address an\nimmediate need, but you\u2019ll want to limit those, as you want to\nprioritize things that have a higher value over time.)\nWill everyone benefit? If it only helps a niche set of customers, is it\nworth the cost?\nIf it succeeds, can w e suppor t it?\nOur friends at Intercom (introduced in Chapter 3) also suggest looking at your\nreturn on development investment to validate an oppor tunity. Create a two-by-\ntwo grid like Figure 4-1, looking at development effort (high/low) vs. how\nusers value the feature/product (high/low), and figure out where this\noppor tunity falls.", "Figure 4-1. Creating a grid to compare development effort to user value is an easy way to visualize and\ncompare different opportunities. Ideally, you will do low-effort/high-user-value tasks first (Feature A) and\navoid high-effort/low-user-values tasks (Feature C) as much as possible.\nUnfortunately, this isn\u2019t a litmus test for oppor tunities because sometimes we\nhave to do high-effort things that users won\u2019t value, like rebuilding a back\nend, but this grid will help you put things in context. Low-effort, highly valued\nfeatures or products are nearly always worth pursuing.\nFor some oppor tunity hypotheses, like \u201cfixing a bug will help us achieve our\ngoal,\u201d this level of validation might be all you need. If it\u2019s clear from data that\nthe bug significantly affects a lot of users, it prevents users from winning, you\nhave the resources to fix it, and the cost vs. value doesn\u2019t outweigh something\nelse you want to do, then great\u2014you\u2019ve validated that it\u2019s worth fixing the", "bug! Other hypotheses require more effort in order to validate them.\nThis internal validation can also help with a soft skill: Respect. You\u2019ll often\nhave people throughout the company giving you product ideas\u2014in fact, you\u2019ll\nhave more ideas than you can implement. This means you\u2019ll spend most of\nyour time saying \u201cno\u201d to good ideas because you want to focus on the best\nideas. But if you simply say \u201cno\u201d without a reason, people will feel that you\ndon\u2019t listen to them, affecting how well you work together, and they will stop\ncoming to you with ideas, which could prevent you from finding a great one.\nDoing an internal validation will let you easily and explicitly provide a\nreason for why you\u2019re pursuing one idea over another, making people feel like\nyou listened to them and aren\u2019t just making arbitrary product decisions.<<<SECTION_BREAK>>>\nEXTERNAL VALIDATION\nExternal validation simply means getting feedback from real customers to see\nif your idea makes sense. Even though you might think you know what they\u2019ll\nsay, you don\u2019t know for sure until you check.\nThere are many ways to get feedback. The simplest one is to be a data\ndetective. What external data about real customers can you find from existing\nresearch sources to validate your idea? Are there relevant research reports,\nwhether it\u2019s Mary Meeker\u2019s Internet Trends report (available for free), NPD\nGroup\u2019s reports on what people are buying and their behavior (these reports\nare expensive but the data\u2019s very valuable and spans numerous industries),\ncensus data, or even Google Trends to see what people are searching for?\nSometimes it might not be obvious where to look, and you\u2019ll need to see if\nthere\u2019s a similar or analogous vertical whose data will inform your decisions.\nYour primary goal is to focus on the need people are trying to meet, and to\nfind research relevant to that need. This data isn\u2019t always easy to find, and it", "might be spread out across multiple research reports. Financial-analyst\nreports are often great additional sources of overall industry trends.\nAs an example, when on-demand food-delivery services like Postmates\nwere getting started, they could have looked to food-industry reports about\nhow often people order carryout/delivery, how much they spend per order,\nwhat demographics tend to order carryout the most and where they live, which\nsegments of the food industry are growing vs. shrinking, and more.\nSecondarily, Postmates could have researched a specific interaction\nmechanism, push-button ordering with mobile apps, by looking at on-demand\napps like Uber. If Postmates\u2019 hypothesis was that people would like push-\nbutton food delivery, it would\u2019ve meshed these data points, using the food-\nindustry reports to validate demand for food delivery along with the\nmechanism data to validate that people would be willing to order from an\napp.\nMake sure to watch out for confirmation bias. This is when we look for only\nevidence that confirms our hypothesis and ignore evidence that contradicts it.\nAgain, our hypothesis might be wrong, and that\u2019s OK.\nReading market data can be very useful, but it doesn\u2019t always give you great\ninsight to what your customers are feeling, and their needs not captured by\ndata. Empathy can be a powerful validation tool: Is there some way for you to\nbe your customer so that you can accurately understand his needs? Sometimes\nthis is easy; for example, if you\u2019re a PM at Slack, you use Slack internally to\ncommunicate. You\u2019ll know how people use the product because you use it\ndaily, and you can validate your idea by analyzing how useful it\u2019d be to your\nlife and if there\u2019s a tradeoff or cost that\u2019d reduce the value. Be careful here, as\nyou\u2019ll need to make sure the way you use Slack is similar to how your\ncustomers use it.", "Other times, being your customer is doable but takes effort. Ford Motor\nCompany built a special suit, the Third Age Suit, which effectively simulates\nwhat it feels like to be an elderly driver, with reduced joint mobility, a\nsimulated feeling of arthritis, simulated impaired vision conditions, and more.\nThis suit lets Ford employees \u201cbe\u201d an elderly customer to test features in their\ncars without having to bring in a pool of elderly test drivers to observe and\ntalk with.\nThe trick to being your customer is to make sure you\u2019re representative of an\nactual customer. Even though we all like to think we\u2019re an average customer,\nwe\u2019re not\u2014you\u2019re a PM, you\u2019re above  average! And especially if your\nproduct has multiple personas, you\u2019ll likely represent only one of them.\nUnfortunately, sometimes it\u2019s not realistic to be your customer, especially for\nenterprise and niche products. In these cases, you just have to find another\napproach to understanding your customers.<<<SECTION_BREAK>>>\nCustomer Development\nFinally, sometimes it\u2019s necessary to go outside the building to talk with\ncustomers, both current and potential. Keep in mind that the goal right now is\nto figure out whether to build a given thing, not to conduct user\ntesting/research to see if we\u2019ve built a particular thing well. The former\nhappens at the beginning of the product process, and the later will happen\nonce we\u2019ve started building something.\nSo what is customer development? It\u2019s a way to validate if the people you\nthink are your customers truly are the right customers and confirming you\u2019re\non the right path. This includes finding out what problems customers are\nseeking to solve, what they\u2019re doing right now that either creates those\nproblems and tries to solve them, what they\u2019re able to do (technically,", "financially, socially, etc.), and how they find out about and decide if a new\nproduct/feature is worth it. Fundamentally, it\u2019s a conversation and an\nexchange of information.\nIt\u2019s also useful to know what customer development is not. It\u2019s not a way for\npeople to give you a wish list. It\u2019s not a focus group to only see how people\nrespond to ideas. It\u2019s not a place to observe how customers use your\nprototype. It\u2019s also not a replacement for product vision. Customers will give\nyou a huge wish list, but they\u2019ll often ask for more than they actually need, end\nup not using features, and \u2014in really bad cases\u2014might get confused by all the\nextra features. This is a big part of why we recommend having some\noppor tunity hypotheses in mind first.<<<SECTION_BREAK>>>\nInterviews\nWe\u2019ve found that, of the various steps in the product-development life cycle,\npeople new to product management have the least experience with customer\ninterviews. But interviewing is an incredibly valuable skill because it\u2019s an\neffective and low-cost way to validate your oppor tunity hypothesis. And since\na product manager\u2019s ultimate goal is to help the customer be awesome,\nspending time with customers is critical to your role.\nThere are entire book s, such as Cindy Alvarez\u2019s excellent Lean Customer\nDevelopment, that cover in detail how to prepare, do, and learn from\ncustomer interviews. We\u2019ll do our best to give you a detailed overview, but\nwe\u2019d recommend doing further research and practicing your own interviews\nbefore actually talking with customers.\nPreparing for Interviews\nJust like how you don\u2019t walk into a job interview without preparing, or a\nmeeting without anticipating a desired outcome, customer interviews take", "preparation. These steps are largely based on Lean Customer Development\nbecause we believe in them!\nTo get started, write down a list of what you know factually and what you\u2019re\nassuming about our customers, including their needs and how your product\nsatisfies them. The Business Model Canvas can help you identify key\nassumptions. Of course, customers can help you validate only parts of the\ncanvas that apply to them: segments, value propos itions, channels,\nrelationships, and maybe revenue streams. But given how fundamental these\nare to your business/product, they\u2019re quite important to turn from guesses into\nfacts.\nUse the Value Propos ition Canvas to identify what you know for sure and\nwhat you\u2019re assuming are your customers\u2019 existing pains and desired gains.\nAlso try to identify what tradeoffs they\u2019re willing to accept for these gains.\nFor example, does a smartwatch provide enough functional and fashion gain\nthat they\u2019re willing to trade off the sentimental value of their existing watch?\nOr does your augmented-reality headwear provide enough value that your\ncustomers are willing to make the social sacrifice to wear it? Google Glass\nlearned customers\u2019 feelings about that tradeoff in a very public and expensive\nway.\nIt can be helpful to explicitly write your oppor tunity hypothesis in terms of\nthese canvases: \u201cI believe that <personas/segments> experience <this pain>\nwhen doing <task> because of <limitation>, and alleviating that pain would\nlet the customer <achieve this gain>, although she\u2019d have to <accept these\nlimitations>.\u201d\nDon\u2019t forget about what you think your key metrics are and who you believe\nyour competitors are. Your customers might not see the same people as\ncompetitors, or they might know of existing solutions that you don\u2019t.", "Also, it\u2019s useful to know your company and product roadmap: How\u2019d you\nget to where you are, where are you thinking about going, what are the open\nquestions, and what information from customers might help you make better\ndecisions?\nIt\u2019s useful to look at any other persona trait relevant to your oppor tunity\nhypothesis to think about who to talk with, and if there are enough potential\ncustomers to pursue this oppor tunity. For example, if your product provides a\nconvenience service for a fee, you\u2019ll want to focus on customers who will pay\nfor convenience rather than people who have coupons .com as their homepage\n\u2014still talk to a couple of people who value cash over convenience to get a\nsense of where their tipping point might be, however. Other traits to look at\ninclude where potential customers fall on the risk vs. reward, low-tech vs.\ntech-savvy, bored vs. busy, and frequent vs. infrequent purchase spectrum.\nA\u2014hopefully obvious\u2014technique to help make sure you\u2019re finding the right\ncustomers is to create screener questions you ask potential interviewees. Try\nto hide the \u201cright\u201d answer so that people don\u2019t answer with what they think\nyou want to hear. If you want people who use streaming music services, ask\nwhat product they use to listen to music. Also ask questions to exclude\npeople, like, \u201cHow often did you listen to music last week?\u201d Braden Kowitz\nat Google Ventures created a useful template to help you screen for\nparticipants, available at https://goo.gl /uPBXD6.\nOnce you\u2019ve figured out who you want to talk with (more on finding these\npeople shortly), let\u2019s figure out what to ask them. The most important thing to\nknow is that, whether they realize it or not, people are going to try to please\nyou. The most valuable thing you can do is to get the customer to tell you\nabout how they currently deal with whatever problem you\u2019re thinking about\nsolving. Even if you think you have a new service (imagine someone", "considering a food-delivery service like Postmates for the first time), your\ncustomer might already do something in this space (ordering from restaurants\nthat aren\u2019t their favorite specifically because they deliver, getting carry-out,\netc.) that you\u2019ll want to ask about.\nThere\u2019s a phenomenon called \u201cideal self\u201d where if you ask someone about\nwhat they might do, they never give a good answer. Would you like to lose\nweight? Would you like to save time? Would you like to have delivery from\nyour favorite restaurants that don\u2019t currently deliver? Of course the answer is\nyes to all of these!\nInstead, if you ask questions about what people currently do, you\u2019ll see what\nactually happens in their lives, which is a much better predictor of what\nthey\u2019ll do in the future. How often do you go to the gym? What diets have you\nused in the past six months? Do you pay a handyman or fix things around the\nhouse yourself? When did you last order delivery? Did you make a restaurant\nchoice based on who delivered?\nSimilarly, asking what someone will pay is useless because no one will give\nyou an honest and meaningful answer. But it\u2019s useful to ask what they\u2019ve\nalready paid to try to answer this question. If they haven\u2019t spent anything in\nthe area you\u2019re asking about, it\u2019s likely not an issue for them.\nRather than asking customers if they\u2019d like your feature/product\u2014be cause\nthey\u2019ll say yes\u2014it\u2019s better to find out about how they deal with the\nfundamental problem you\u2019re trying to solve. The simplest way to ask a\nquestion like this is, \u201cTell me about how you do < topic> today.\u201d\nUnfortunately, it\u2019ll take some prompting to get useful information. For\nexample, someone might have a situation or limitation that he doesn\u2019t see as\nrelevant to your discussion but that could play a huge role. Maybe your\nproduct needs a fast cellular connection to work well, but the person you\u2019re", "interviewing barely has 3G where he lives. It\u2019s very helpful to get context.\nHere are some sample questions:\nHow often hav e you de alt with this topic?\nWhat were you doi ng right before this topic came up?\nOnce you finished, what\u2019d you do?\nHow long di d it take to deal with the topic?\nWhat made you buy  the produc t relevant to this topic?\nHow often do y ou buy  the produc t?\nWhere do y ou go t o buy  the produc t?\nIt\u2019s also really valuable when you ask questions that get customers to tell you\nstories rather than giving simple yes/no answers. They\u2019ll automatically\nprovide you some background context, or you can politely interrupt and ask\nthem to clarify any needed context. Stories help you go up to a slightly\nabstract level because you\u2019ll often find out why someone was using the\nproduct, what their goals were, and what they prioritized. You\u2019ll also find that\npeople say things implicitly in stories so that you don\u2019t have to prompt for\nmore\u2014e.g. they might mention using Siri, which means they are iPhone users.\nSometimes you\u2019ll have customers who think they know exactly what they\nwant and will tell you specifically. For niche products with advanced users,\nthese people likely do know exactly what they want, and they know enough\nabout how the product works to know what\u2019s possible. But that\u2019s a very small\ngroup. Most customers don\u2019t know what\u2019s possible or impossible, and you\u2019ll\nlikely want to ignore specific feature requests. Instead, it\u2019s your job to figure\nout people\u2019s underlying pains and see if your idea will address them. Think\nabout the Henry Ford\u2019s \u201cfaster horse\u201d example here: The feature request is a", "faster horse. The underlying desire is the desire to get to a destination faster.\nRestating someone\u2019s feature request to make sure you understand it and\nasking what she thinks it\u2019d let her do or  how she envisions using that feature is\nan easy way to start to get to the underlying desire. You could also use the\n\u201cmagic wand\u201d question: If you could wave a magic wand and be able to do\nanything you can\u2019t do today , what would it be? Anything you can imagine is\npossible. What would you like? This might seem like an ideal-self question,\nbut it\u2019s not, because we\u2019re not asking if a customer would do something.\nWe\u2019re actually asking, \u201cWhat\u2019s your biggest pain point around this topic?\u201d in\na more fun way. Hopefully our hypothesis addresses it!\nIt\u2019s also useful to ask about tradeoffs. \u201cIf <new feature/product> were to\nhappen but it meant that <tradeoff>, how would you feel?\u201d This does start to\nhit on the ideal-self question, but it can give you a sense of what a customer\nvalues.\nSometimes customers are used to seeing the world one way, and might not\nrealize that they have a real pain point. Did you realize how annoying the taxi\nexperience was before you tried Uber or Lyft? You might need to think of\nquestions to tease out if there is an unrealized pain point, like asking how\noften someone walks to a hotel to find a taxi rather than trying to hail one on\nthe street.\nIf you have an existing product and a fairly detailed oppor tunity hypothesis,\nyou can also use a hypothetical situation. Have part of the interview where\nyou say something like, \u201cI want to tell you a story about how we imagine\nsomeone like you using the next version of our product based on what we\u2019ve\nheard from other customers. Please interrupt me if you have questions, if you\ndisagree with anything I\u2019m saying, or if I\u2019m just plain wrong!\u201d This approach\ncan help you find out about any limitations customers have, if your product has", "unused features, and if your customers are using your product how you\nimagine they\u2019re using it.\nGenerally, avoid showing any existing products or prototypes, as that\nfocuses the conversation on what you have rather than on what the customer\nneeds. However, it can be useful for customers to show you any existing\nsolutions they have in place, and you might notice aspects of the solutions that\nthe customers don\u2019t explicitly realize.\nYou\u2019ll also want to avoid loaded and leading questions\u2014that is, questions\nthat imply an answer or encourage the customer to answer in a specific way.\n\u201cMr. Smith, do you still beat your wife?\u201d is a loaded question because it\nimplies guilt even if Mr. Smith wouldn\u2019t harm a fly and never ever beat his\nwife. \u201cDo you have problems with your PC?\u201d is leading because it implies\nthe customer uses a PC and that his PC has problems. \u201cTell me about your\nprimary computer\u201d is better because it doesn\u2019t imply any judgment and lets\ncustomers respond with what they care about.\nPut together your first list of questions, but don\u2019t worry about making it\nperfect. As you start to do real interviews, you\u2019ll refine your questions based\non if you\u2019re getting the information you want\u2014this doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019ll get the\nanswers you\u2019re hoping to hear. Your list will never be perfect, but keeping\nthis advice in mind will help you get a great start.\nWe recommend taking a step back once you have a list together, and really\nthinking about if these questions will deliver the information you\u2019re hoping to\nlearn from the interviews. One way to do this would be to imagine what the\nmost useful results would look like\u2014which you could derive by thinking\nabout how you intend to use the results from the interviews\u2014and working\nbackwards to see if your questions will deliver.\nThere is one question you should always ask at the end of an interview: \u201cIs", "there anything else about <this topic> that I should\u2019ve asked about?\u201d Here\u2019s\nwhen you account for the known unknowns\u2014that is, the category of things the\ncustomer cares about, and that you know exists, but you have no idea what\nelse might be in there beyond what you asked. For example, maybe you were\nfocused on how quickly a customer can access Google Now or Siri on his\nphone, but it turns out the customer hates voice recognition because it doesn\u2019t\nwork with his accent.\nOnce you have your question list together, start preparing the logistics. Here\nare some key issues to consider:\nWhat\u2019s the last date where interviews can give you useful\ninformation? Customer development takes time, and often there are\ninternal milestones beyond which new information isn\u2019t helpful.\nKnowing these milestones in advance helps you craft an effective\ninterview schedule.\nWhat level of quality and confidence in the results do you need?\nDo you have a bit of time to really do a thorough job, or do you have\nto work as fast as possible even if the results are imperfect?\nWhat\u2019s the right medium for the interviews: in person or on the\nphone? In person is always best, but that might not be feasible if your\ncustomers aren\u2019t all in the same city. Phone chats are often easier to\nschedule and more convenient, but you\u2019ll miss any non-verbal cues,\nlike facial expressions. Video chat solves that problem, but it can be\nrather frustrating if it\u2019s not working or if the interviewee isn\u2019t tech-\nsavvy\u2014you don\u2019t want to spend your interview time debugging a\nconnection.", "How much time will each interview take? Interviews tend to run\nlong\u2014pe ople run late, you find interesting things to ask about, etc.\u2014\nso if you plan on conducting a 20-minute interview rather than a 30-\nminute one, you\u2019ll likely hit your time goals. Make sure to\ncommunicate your time expectations clearly to your interviewees.\nShould you pay your interviewees? In general, yes. Somewhere\nbetween $50 and $100 per hour is common, and it\u2019s often as a gift\ncard rather than cash. You\u2019re asking people to work for you and\nprovide their expertise, and you\u2019ll use that input to make money. The\none exception would be if you\u2019re talking with someone who reached\nout to you, such as a current customer who emailed the support team.\nThe best way to pay those people is to make the product even better\nfor them! You can also make them feel special by including them in\nearly-access programs.<<<SECTION_BREAK>>>\nFinding People to Talk With\nWe\u2019ve got our hypothesis, we\u2019ve got our interview goals, we\u2019ve got our\nquestions, and we know the type of interviewees we want to talk with. Now\nall we need are interviewees! This might seem scary, but it\u2019s easier than you\nexpect. People like to help others, especially if they can sound like experts.\nApproach people humbly, saying you\u2019d love their help and want input from\ntheir experience, and you\u2019ll find willing interviewees.\nLook at your connections first. Do you know anyone directly who fits your\ntarget persona, or do you know people who might know people? Don\u2019t\nhesitate to ask your connections directly. Make your request explicit: tell them\nwhy you\u2019re asking, make it clear what the interview would involve (time,", "format\u2014like on site vs. phone call), and mention how helpful it would be. If\nyou\u2019re asking a connection to reach into her network, create an easily\nforwarded email so that it\u2019s simple for your friend to press \u201cForward\u201d and\nsend the email to anyone she knows without adding a long note.\nSocial networks can be great resources, too. Reach out on LinkedIn, Quora,\nsubject-relevant forums, or even Twitter to see if you can find people willing\nto help. If there\u2019s a particular physical place your customers hang out, try\ngoing there in person and talking with people, or at least posting a notice\nasking people to contact you if they\u2019d be willing to provide input.\nCraigslist and other online classifieds will be very hit-or-miss, and more\nmiss than hit. You really don\u2019t know who will stumble upon your post given\nCraigslist has such a wide audience, and it might take more time to filter for\nthe right interviewees than it\u2019s worth.\nIf you\u2019re really stumped, ask yourself this: Once you\u2019ve built the product,\nhow are you planning to find customers to sell to? Or, if you already have a\nproduct, how do you reach your existing customers? Use similar techniques to\nreach your audience, but rather than asking them to open their wallets, ask for\ntheir wisdom.\nFor existing products, you should have already had customers reach out to\nyou to offer opinions. People who speak up might not represent the silent\nmajority who won\u2019t complain or comment, though, so you\u2019ll still want to find\nwhat the quieter people want. Your sales and support teams can point you to\ngood customers to talk with. When reaching out to these people, make it clear\nyou\u2019re exploring oppor tunities and not changing the product, and give them\npermission to complain. They\u2019ll let you know about their pain.\nThere are also many market-research firms you can hire to help you find the\nright customers to talk with, and they will also often help conduct interviews.", "These firms can be a bit pricey and take a while to produce results, but they\nmake your life a lot easier.\nNo matter how you find your interview subjects, remember to use your\nscreening questions to make sure these potential subjects fit your criteria.\nAfter you\u2019ve found the right subjects, schedule the interviews. Provide very\nclear instructions for everything your interview subjects need to know, such as\nparking availability for onsite visits and your direct contact information. Once\nscheduled, confirm the interview, and consider a reminder call or email the\nday of, too. Multiple tools that help you schedule interviews, such as\nPowWow, will send the reminders for you.<<<SECTION_BREAK>>>\nConducting the Interviews\nNow comes the fun part\u2014talking with real people. Before you begin, take a\nbreath and smile\u2014you\u2019re a friendly researcher right now, no matter what else\nis going on during the day.\nAs soon as you greet your interviewees, make them feel comfortable. You\nwant them to open up and have a conversation with you, not feel like they\u2019re\nbeing interrogated or rushed. Watch the time, but be courteous about it. Talk\nwith them as a human, and call them by their names\u2014don \u2019t call them\n\u201ccustomer.\u201d Make it clear that there are no right or wrong answers\u2014you want\ntheir expertise and you appreciate their time.\nIt\u2019s helpful to get interviewees talking right away by starting with simple\nquestions that the customers won\u2019t have to think too hard about, like asking\nthem how they deal with the topic you\u2019re looking at now. Imagine an arc: start\nwith small talk, go to easy questions, move to meatier questions, recap key\npoints, and then thank them for their time.\nYour job is to be quiet and listen\u2014don \u2019t jump in and start talking when the", "other person takes a breath. You\u2019ll even want to wait a few beats after\nsomeone finishes a thought before saying more, in case she\u2019s thinking and\nplanning on elaborating on her answer. If someone criticizes your product,\ndon\u2019t get defensive; remain neutral and encouraging, getting the person to talk.\nEven smile and sympathize!\nTo make sure you understand what your interviewees said, ask for anything\nyou want clarified, and even restate what they said into your own words.\nYou\u2019ll also want to clarify vague expressions. If someone says, \u201cI hate\nwaiting for this,\u201d find out where his tipping point is\u2014is he OK waiting one\nminute but five feels like a waste?\nIn terms of taking notes, you\u2019ll generally want to record what your subject\nsays verbatim rather than summarizing. This will help you avoid confirmation\nbias, and it\u2019ll make it easier to analyze the conversation later on. It\u2019s very\nuseful to have a notetaker so that you can focus on the person rather than\nwriting. Failing that, use a smart pen like Livescribe, which records your\nconversation and lets you tap on any notes you take to immediately jump to\nthat part of the conversation.\nMake sure to note any non-verbals, and star any emotional utterances (\u201cI\nhate/love this\u201d). One exception to the verbatim-recording goal is if they say\n\u201cmaybe\u201d; write it dow n as \u201cno.\u201d\nAt the end of an interview, thank the subject for his time, and ask if you can\nfollow up later.\nIf you\u2019ve never done an interview before or you\u2019re not sure about your\nquestions, do a practice interview or three with someone you know. It usually\ntakes 5 to 10 interviews to fully get into the zone, and unless you\u2019re changing\nyour questions, 15 to 20 interviews is usually when you stop hearing new\nthings.<<<SECTION_BREAK>>>", "Drawing Conclusions from Interviews\nTake some time immediately after each interview to pull out 5 to 10 of the\nmost interesting points. Focus on things the subject said that validated or\ninvalidated your hypothesis, carried emotion, or surprised to you.\nEach interview should help you figure out if your hypothesis addresses a\nvalid pain point the customer has: whether the customer has tried to solve that\npain point before, whether the customer cares enough about this pain point to\nwant it fixed, and if there\u2019s nothing that\u2019d stop the customer from using your\nsolution. You should have a good sense of how your product would fit into the\nperson\u2019s life day to day, if it\u2019d replace anything, and, if she wouldn\u2019t buy your\nproduct, the specific reasons why.\nMake sure to pay attention to actionable vs. wishy-washy words your\ncustomers use. If they say, \u201cI keep meaning to,\u201d then they don\u2019t actually care\nabout the topic at hand. If they say, \u201cHere\u2019s what I\u2019ve tried and what I do,\u201d\nthen they care. \u201c<This> would help me achieve <this goal>\u201d is meaningful,\nwhereas, \u201c<This> would be interesting to have\u201d and \u201cI think I could figure out\nhow to use it\u201d mean this person won\u2019t use the product. If they say, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t\nuse it, but others would,\u201d no one will use it. Similarly, \u201cMaybe it\u2019s just me\u201d\nmeans lots of people feel that way.\nPull the data from all your interviews together into an overall summary that\nyou update as you go. Categorize what the customers say as appropriate,\nincluding pain points, emotions, existing solutions, and so on. Even try sorting\ntheir words into \u201cvalidates hypothesis\u201d and \u201cinvalidates hypothesis\u201d buckets.\nTry to see if you can identify trends with multiple customers having similar\ncomments.\nIf you haven\u2019t found anyone excited about your idea in five or so interviews,\neither you\u2019re talking to the wrong people or your problem isn\u2019t a real problem", "for customers. Try changing who your target subjects are, and if the trend\ncontinues, you just invalidated your hypothesis. Also, if your questions aren\u2019t\ngiving you the insights you want, change them!\nIf only a few people see your oppor tunity as a pain point they care about, the\npotential market for your product might not be large enough to matter. You\u2019ll\nwant to do more (like a survey, which we\u2019ll cover next) to try to gauge the\nmarket size, but this should be a warning sign.\nSometimes you\u2019ll notice customers discussing the same pain point again and\nagain, even if it\u2019s different from your oppor tunity. Absolutely note this pain\npoint, and analyze if it\u2019s a better oppor tunity (has a bigger value, lower cost,\netc.) than the one you\u2019re looking at now.\nAfter 15 to 20 interviews, you should have a good idea about how valid\nyour oppor tunity hypothesis is.<<<SECTION_BREAK>>>\nSurveys\n\u201cThe plural of \u2018anecdote\u2019 is not \u2018data.\u2019\u201d (This sentence is attributed to Frank\nKotsonis and Roger Brinner.) Interviews are great because they help you\nfigure out customers\u2019 underlying pain points and motivations, but they\u2019re just a\nsmall sample of your user base (or potential user base). They don\u2019t help you\nquantify issues or measure overall attitudes. Analytics don\u2019t provide that type\nof information either. Analytics are great at exposing what customers actually\ndo, but they don\u2019t tell you anything about what\u2019s going on in a customer\u2019s\nmind.\nSurveys occupy this murky area, where we can get a view inside a lot of\ncustomers\u2019 heads. In general, the data surveys provide isn\u2019t as high quality as\nthat from customer interviews, but it\u2019s a low-cost way to see if our\nconclusions from customer interviews scale to a large number of people.", "There are multiple ways to use surveys\u2014on e example is how we used them\nin Chapter 3 to gauge your overall NPS as a potential starting point for finding\nan oppor tunity. We\u2019ll focus now on using them to validate a hypothesis.\nIn the validation step of the product-development cycle, never start with a\nsurvey\u2014you\u2019ll find out better questions to ask and get more real data about\npeople\u2019s needs with interviews, but once you think the interviews have\nvalidated your hypothesis, surveys will help you see if the bulk of your\ncustomers agree.<<<SECTION_BREAK>>>\nCreating Surveys\nGood survey design is also a bit of an art. Because you\u2019re not there to ask\nclarifying questions or to pay attention to non-verbal cues, you need to be\ncareful of how you design them. You\u2019ll also want to test any survey before\nsending it to a broad group.\nLike you would with an interview, start by explicitly focusing on your goal.\nIt should be \u201cto further validate my hypothesis by seeing how many people\nhave this pain, have invested significant resources trying to solve it, are\nunhappy with the solution, and could implement my solution.\u201d\nIn general, keep surveys short! They should take only a few minutes to fill\nout. Survey fatigue is a real thing, and the quality of the answers in the middle\nof a survey drops compared to the beginning and end, especially on longer\nsurveys. To help account for that fatigue, wherever possible, randomize your\nquestions (or more commonly, randomize the ordering for the groups of\nquestions you present).\nYou\u2019ll also want to randomize how the answers are presented to account for\na bias anyone has toward just picking a specific answer number\u2014remember\nwhen you guessed \u201cC\u201d on every question you didn\u2019t know in school?", "It\u2019s critical to keep your questions and answer choices very clear\u2014you\nmight know what industry jargon means, but your customers might not. Even\nphrases that seem obvious, like \u201cQ4,\u201d can be ambiguous\u2014do you mean a\nfiscal or calendar Q4? Just specify the months instead.\nWhen picking questions, you\u2019ll also want an arc for the survey. Start with\nbroad questions, move into specifics, and close with a place for the customer\nto add any extra thoughts. Group related categories together, too, to help the\ncustomer with context.\nLike with interviews, always aim for actual instead of ideal-self questions\u2014\ni.e., ask what customers have done, not what they might do. Also avoid\nleading and loaded questions. For example, rather than asking if the customer\nhas recently used online billing tools, ask how a customer pays bills, with an\noption for online billing.\nComparison questions, whether between what the customer uses now and\nsomething else or between two hypothetical products, are implicitly leading\nbecause analyzing a hypothetical is very hard. It\u2019s better to present the two\noptions separately and to have people rate their experience with or thoughts\nabout each specific option. Later, you can compare the results.\nComparison questions also often ask two questions in one because you\u2019re\nevaluating each product\u2019s value. It\u2019s always better to ask separate, simple\nquestions rather than one question that really includes multiple questions.\nTables that explicitly ask a user to rank her thoughts about specific items are\nuseful to figure out how many customers value this potential pain point and\nhow much, and to analyze how trends change over time. For example, \u201cAre\nyou completely dissatisfied, slightly dissatisfied, neutral, satisfied,\ncompletely satisfied, or n/a with your ISP\u2019s download speed?\u201d is a useful\nquestion, and you can ask it again and again as the speed and what customers", "do online changes. Ranking like this is also great because it lets you build an\nimportance/satisfaction graph with real data. Simple agree/disagree questions\nare frequently biased because people want to please you and are more likely\nto select \u201cagree.\u201d Use a scale instead to get more accurate answers.\nAsk for specifics when a bucket has a lot of variability. Age is a great\nexample because surveys often have questions asking which age range you fall\ninto. But between 18 and 40, there\u2019s a lot of potential variability in your life,\nespecially depending on where you live. People in cities might still be single,\nliving with roommates, and have lots of disposable income at 30, whereas a\nperson in a rural area might be married with three kids. Instead, ask the\nperson\u2019s age specifically, and ask specifics for any other data you need to\ncorrectly segment the customer. And, of course, remember what we\u2019ve\nmentioned again and again about segmentation around pain/needs/jobs being\nmore effective than around demographics.\nAt the same time, allow for flexibility when needed. Fifty years ago, people\nwere much more likely to join a company, stay there their entire career, and\nthen retire. Today, you could be employed and looking for a job, or self-\nemployed but in between contracts (essentially unemployed).\nIt\u2019s totally reasonable to have empty text fields where people can type\nstories, rather than radio buttons where they\u2019re constrained to fixed answers.\nAsking how someone\u2019s last flight experience on an American carrier was will\nyield more interesting results than, \u201cHow satisfied were you with your\nflight?\u201d Make sure that if you ask for a detailed answer, you don\u2019t set a low\ncharacter limit on your survey\u2019s answer box.\nAsking \u201cwhy\u201d questions can be dangerous because people are not very self-\naware. As with interview questions, aiming to understand a customer\u2019s goals\nhelps dive at motivation more explicitly. \u201cWhat\u2019s the top thing you hope to", "learn from this book ?\u201d is a better question than \u201cWhy did you buy this book ?\u201d\n(Please email the authors if we\u2019re not meeting your needs!)\nWhen conducting a survey about an existing product, it\u2019s also good to ask a\nNet Promoter Score question (see Chapter 2), as this will implicitly help you\nmeasure the score over time as you conduct more surveys.\nExecuting Surveys\nThere are many tools to create surveys: Google Forms, SurveyMonkey,\nTypeform, etc. The best tools will let you add conditional sections so that you\ncan ask follow-up questions based on how your customers answer questions.\nIf they\u2019re unsatisfied with something, you might want to dig into more\nspecifics about why to help you validate your hypothesis, but if they\u2019re\ncompletely satisfied, you don\u2019t need to ask more questions.\nFinding people to take your survey is similar to but arguably easier than an\ninterview because a survey is much less of a demand on someone\u2019s time than\nan interview. If you have an existing app, add a pop-up in-app or email\nexisting customers that meet your filter requirements to ask if they have five\nminutes to take a survey to help improve the product. Note how that sample\ntext has the survey\u2019s goal, \u201chelp improve the product,\u201d which explains why\nit\u2019s valuable for customers to take it. This makes it more likely a customer\nwill complete the survey.\nPosting on various forms and social networks where your target market\nresides is useful, too. If you\u2019re doing minimal manual filtering when sending\nthe survey link, though, you\u2019ll want more filter questions at the start of your\nsurvey to make sure only the people you want to hear from are actually\nprogressing through the survey and answering the main questions.\nThere are also services like Ask Your Target Market that have a large", "mailing list, and you can pay to send your survey link to exactly the right\npeople. Paying for targeted ads on Google, LinkedIn, Twitter, Facebook , and\nmore is another way to find pot ential respondents.\nGenerally surveys are unpaid, but companies often offer a lottery-like\nreward at the end to add an incentive for people to participate (\u201cProvide your\nemail address to be entered in a raffle to win a $100 g ift card\u201d).<<<SECTION_BREAK>>>\nAnalyzing Data\nRun your survey until you feel you have statistically significant results or until\nyou stop getting new/useful/different results.\nWhen you\u2019re ready to start looking at results, the very first thing to do is\nvalidate the data. What do you do with incomplete surveys? Do you want to\nignore them or manually look at them to see where\u2014and maybe why\u2014pe ople\nstoppe d answering? If you use the data, you\u2019ll have a different sample size for\neach question.\nNext, do you want to do any partitioning based on background questions?\nPeople who listen to streaming music daily may have different answers than\npeople who listen once a week. What about cohort analysis? People who\ncame from a professional forum might be different than people who started\nreplying only once you added a raffle.\nYou\u2019ll likely want to do a basic data analysis with any numerical questions\n\u2014i.e., convert scales to numbers, look at the mean, median, variance, etc.\nYou\u2019ll also want to look at the distribution to see if it\u2019s standard/normal\u2014that\nis, most people are around a mean\u2014that says the data trends to a point.\nHowever, if it\u2019s bimodal, answers fall into two discrete categories, that tells\nyou something else, and a mean isn\u2019t useful for that question.\nIn general, like with interviews, you\u2019re still looking for anything that", "validates or invalidates your oppor tunity hypothesis. But the other aspect you\nwant to look for with a survey is how many people feel this is a pain point,\nand how significant of a pain point is it.\nIf everyone agrees it\u2019s a pain point but no one has spent any time or money\ntrying to solve it, your oppor tunity is likely not worth building unless a\nsolution is very cheap to build or you have reason to believe your solution\nwill make customers realize the pain point is bigger than they thought. You\ncould imagine what a survey about voicemail would\u2019ve looked like before\nvisual voicemail on the iPhone\u2014finding, listening to, and saving a specific\nvoicemail message was a pain, but no handset manufacturer spent money to\nsolve it because it required service carrier coope ration.\nIf you used satisfaction questions to build up an importance/satisfaction\ngraph\u2014bot h in terms of how customers perceive importance and how you\ninternally rank importance\u2014you can see if your oppor tunity is the right one to\npursue next or if there\u2019s something more important.\nBecause it\u2019s very easy to fall victim to confirmation bias, try focusing only\non data that invalidates your hypothesis before looking for data that validates\nit. At this point, you should have a very good sense of whether your\nhypothesis is valid and if it\u2019s a valuable enough oppor tunity to pursue.<<<SECTION_BREAK>>>\nExperiments\nAn additional way to validate a hypothesis is to run an experiment where you\nbuild something to test your hypothesis. This isn\u2019t always possible, but if you\ncan run one, it\u2019ll yield incredibly informative results.\nExperiments are complementary to customer development, not a\nreplacement, as they\u2019ll help you see what people do when you make a change,\nbut they won\u2019t help you understand why people do it or what their fundamental", "needs are.<<<SECTION_BREAK>>>\nA/B Tests\nOne of the most common experiments to try with an existing product is called\nan A/B test. The idea\u2019s simple: if you make a change to your existing product\nand address the oppor tunity you\u2019re focused on, what impact does it have on\nyour key metric? You\u2019ll implement the change, randomly give some users the\ncurrent \u201cA\u201d version and some users the new \u201cB\u201d version, and then see if the\nmetric changes in a significant way.\nThe hardest part of an A/B test for people to understand is that you\u2019re not\nfully building out the B version in a well-designed and engineered way. The\ngoal is to hack together something quickly and cheaply that will let you\ndetermine if this oppor tunity is worth pursuing in a more thorough way.\nA/B tests are a great way to validate if your hypothesis achieves your goals\nwith iterative/refinement oppor tunities. For example, Google had a hypothesis\nthat the shade of blue used in advertising links affected click-through rates,\nand A/B (and C/D/E, etc.)-testing different shades let Google find a shade that\ngenerated an extra $200 million in revenue, according to Dan Cobley,\nmanaging director of Google UK.\nIt\u2019s most common to A/B-test navigation, user flows, layout, and\nmessaging/content. If your oppor tunity doesn\u2019t fall into these buckets but you\nthink you can A/B-test it anyway, go for it! In fact, sometimes companies beta-\ntesting a completely redesigned, blue-sky-oppor tunity version of their website\nwill randomly direct part of their traffic to the new site and see how the users\u2019\noverall behavior differs from behavior on the main site.\nOptimizely is a very common tool for implementing A/B tests, and its\nexpanding feature set includes support for web, mobile, and desktop apps,", "custom segmenting/test targeting, analytics, and more.<<<SECTION_BREAK>>>\nSimple MVPs\nWe like to talk about two types of minimum viable products, similar to Lean\nStartup (discussed in Chapter 3). The one people most commonly talk about is\nthe version you\u2019ll actually build and release (covered in Chapter 5). The other\ntype is a very simple MVP that you can create to help validate your hypothesis\n\u2014a scaled-back version of your full product vision. These super-simple\nMVPs will be inexpensive to put together and not actually implemented how\nthe real product will be implemented. But they should provide enough to a\npotential end customer that you can gauge if your oppor tunity\u2019s worth\npursuing.\nThe simplest MVP is a preorder MVP. This helps you evaluate if people are\ninterested enough in your idea to open their wallets for it. Create a fake\nmarketing website for your product, describing it as if it already existed with\nthe features you feel are important, and put a \u201cBuy\u201d button at the bottom of the\nsite. Then, market this product like it actually exists, take out different display\nads, and see how many people click \u201cBuy\u201d.\nTo avoid being completely deceptive, we recommend adding a note when\nsomeone clicks \u201cBuy\u201d that says you haven\u2019t finished building this product, are\ncurrently working on it, and they can enter their email address to be updated\nwhen you have new information. This is also a nice way to capture a list of\ncustomer email addresses you can market to when your product is available.\nFor an existing product, you could create a \u201cNew Feature\u201d section on your\nwebsite, see how many people watch an explainer video showing how you\nintend for the feature to work, and use a \u201cLearn More\u201d button instead of a\n\u201cBuy\u201d button to reveal the truth and again capture email addresses.", "Another type of MVP is a concierge MVP (these names are from Eric Ries\nin The Lean Startup). In it, you\u2019ll manually work with your customer just like\na real concierge would to perform a task, where the task is the overall focus\nfor your oppor tunity hypothesis. If you have a hypothesis that people want a\nrestaurant-recommendation app, you\u2019d act like a concierge to help them select\na restaurant. During this process, you\u2019ll want to explicitly focus on the steps\nyou go through to figure out an answer\u2014which questions matter and which\ndon\u2019t, and what\u2019s involved in completing each step\u2014s o that you can\neventually automate them.\nLooking at this restaurant-app idea, if no one asks for your concierge\u2019s help,\nthat\u2019s a big initial sign that something is wrong. Either you\u2019re not appealing to\nthe right customers or you\u2019re not making your value propos ition clear. Then,\nwhen someone expresses interest, you\u2019ll manually discuss with that person\nwhat type of food he likes and dislikes, what type of restaurant\nambience/price point/etc. he\u2019s looking for, and you\u2019ll run a Yelp search for\nhim. You could even offer to arrange transportation.\nAs you go through this process, you\u2019ll find out if customers are interested in\nthe overall idea, which steps are the most useful and what goes into them,\nwhich steps are unexpected but delightful (like arranging transportation), and\nwhich steps customers don\u2019t care about. This helps you refine your hypothesis\nand create a better cost/value estimation. For example, maybe you find your\ncustomers really want a feature that lets them push a button and simply have a\nLyft show up to take them to a nearby open restaurant that they\u2019ll probably\nlike: they care about instant fulfillment over making a reservation and\nplanning.\nMany service start-ups initially began with a concierge MVP, helping them\ngauge interest and better understand the overall problem space and customer", "needs. Wealthfront, an automated investment service, even started with a\nconcierge MVP by having financial advisors manually working with clients.\nA Wizard of Oz MVP is another simple type, sometimes the next step after\nthe concierge MVP. Here, you\u2019ll create a product that looks like it\u2019s fully built\nto an end customer, but humans are doing the work behind the scenes. The\nZappos  founder didn\u2019t start by making an e-commerce site or stocking tons of\ninventory: he took photos of shoes at different shops (with permission), put\nthem online, and when an order came in, he\u2019d manually buy and ship the\nshoes. But to a customer, it looked like Zappos  had a full inventory and was a\nstore by itself.\nThis style of MVP also doesn\u2019t scale, but it\u2019s another way to validate the\ndemand for your oppor tunity. If you can manually keep up with the demand,\nthis idea probably isn\u2019t worth pursuing. But if people love it and you\u2019re\noverwhelmed, that\u2019s a good h int it\u2019s time to automate it.\nThe last type is a fake door  MVP. If you\u2019re thinking about building a new\nfeature into your product, add the UX elements you\u2019d use to trigger the\ninteraction, but rather than actually delivering the feature, provide a\nnotification that the feature\u2019s coming soon. See how many people use your\n\u201cfake door.\u201d For example, if your hypothesis is that people would find a live\ngroup chat feature useful on your online education site, add a \u201cChat\u201d button\nand see how many people click it. If only a tiny percentage do, reconsider if\nit\u2019s worth pursuing this oppor tunity, depending on the value of those customers\nvs. the cost of implementing the feature.\nThe key to remember with every experiment is that you want to keep it\nsimple and cheap. You don\u2019t want to spend so much time designing the perfect\nA/B test or preorder MVP that you\u2019re burned out before you\u2019ve even run the\nexperiment. You\u2019re going to throw away every experiment, regardless of the", "result. If the result\u2019s positive, you\u2019ll have to build the product or feature for\nreal.<<<SECTION_BREAK>>>\nMOVING FORWARD\nAt this point, even if it took a lot of changes and retries because your initial\nhypothesis was wrong, you should have an oppor tunity hypothesis that you\u2019ve\nvalidated as worth pursuing. Woo! It\u2019s time to get going on your roadmap!\nThere\u2019s one more step to think about, and that\u2019s your oppor tunity\u2019s priority\non the roadmap. Even though you\u2019ve found a great oppor tunity, you have\nlimited resources, and another PM might have found a different priority that\u2019s\nmore important to the company\u2019s goals. Every feature has an oppor tunity cost:\nworking on one thing means you\u2019re not working on something else. As a PM,\nyou want to think strategically to make sure you\u2019re always working on the\nthings that matter most. You might have a great idea that you\u2019ve validated, but\nis it what the company should work on next?\nA helpful litmus test is whether this product or feature will help the company\nachieve its current goals. If not, you should likely table it and work on it when\nthe company is focused on the appropriate goal.\nThe Kano model (Chapter 3) provides a useful way to gauge how critical\nyour product or feature is. Is it a basic feature? If so, it\u2019s probably a high\npriority to do next because your users expect it and you\u2019re not doing it\u2014or at\nleast not well enough. If it\u2019s a satisfier or delighter, you can prioritize it based\non its value (how much you think it will provide towards your goal) vs. cost.\nA simple way to compare priorities is to come up with a value vs. cost\nnumber. Work with an engineering lead to put difficulty values on different\noppor tunities. From your customer-development work and other internal\nanalysis, create business-value numbers for each oppor tunity. Use higher", "numbers to indicate more expensive cost, or more valuable. Because it\u2019s\ntough to estimate value and difficulty precisely, use an exponential series\nrather than a linear one\u2014i.e., use 1, 2, 4, 8, and 16 rather than 1 through 5.\nThis way, it\u2019s very clear when one oppor tunity is harder or more valuable\nthan another. Next, for each oppor tunity, figure out a score using score =\nvalue\u00f7cost. Focus on the highest-scoring oppor tunities first, as they provide\nthe most value for the lowest cost. You might choose to change priorities\nbased on other factors, but this will give you a good s tarting point.\nWe\u2019ll conclude this section with a warning: you might have a run of good\nluck where you create hypotheses that customers vehemently validate. Keep\nvalidating your ideas, though; just because you were right before doesn\u2019t mean\nyou\u2019ll always be right. Taking time to validate your idea is a lot more\neffective than skipping this step, building the product/feature, and finding out\nyou were wrong.<<<SECTION_BREAK>>>\nMOOVER\u2019S OPPORTUNITY-VALIDATION STRATEGY\nIn Chapter 3 we came up with a hypothesis for Moove r that if we integrate\ninto the app everything that happened in the follow-up call for planning a\nmove, our customers will be happier. We came up with this from data\u2014NPS\nsurvey results\u2014plus internal discussion. During the internal discussion, we\nessentially did the internal validation, and we agreed it made sense to work\non.\nBut Moove r has a lot of possible things to work on next, and we want to\nmake sure in-app messaging is the right one. This means we want to do\ncustomer development, interviewing real customers. We want to learn if\nmessaging really is an annoyance, if our in-app messaging feature would\nsolve that pain, and if there\u2019s something else we\u2019ve missed that we should", "work on instead.\nHere\u2019s the first version of our interview template:\nHave you moved before, without Moove r? If so, what was it like?\nHow did you hear about Moove r?\nWhat was your experience like using Moove r?\nWhich moving company did you pick, and what made you pick them?\nHow did you communicate with the moving company outside of\nMoove r?\n(If they say \u201cphone\u201d): How many times did you attempt to contact each\nother before you actually talked? (That is, you call them and get\nvoicemail and you miss their return call.)\nHow do y ou feel about talking with someone on the phone?\nCould you tell me what your first and second preferred forms of\ncommunication are (e.g., phone calls, email, SMS, something else)?\nWhat additional information did the moving company need to give you\na final estimate?\nHow long did it take to go from starting to communicate with the\ncompany to providing your information to getting a final bid? Did that\ndelay affect your planning?\nDid you have any special items, like a piano? If so, what was it like to", "arrange moving that?\n(If the move has happened already): How did things go the day of the\nmove? Was there any preparation with the movers that didn\u2019t happen\nthat would\u2019ve made the actual move smoother? Post-move, how did\nthings go with the moving company?\n(If they\u2019ve moved previously): What parts of Moove r saved you time\ncompared to when you moved before?\nIf I could wave a magic wand and change any part of the moving\nexperience (aside from packing and unpacking\u2014say this with a\nlaugh), what would you want me to change?\nOn a scale of 1 to 10, with 10 being \u201cdefinitely\u201d and 1 being \u201cnot at\nall,\u201d how likely are you to recommend Moove r to a friend? (If you\ndon\u2019t think you\u2019ve gotten answers that reflect this number, probe more\nand ask about the single biggest factor that led to their picking that\nnumber.)\nIs there anything I didn\u2019t ask you about communicating with the\nmoving company that I should know?\nWe\u2019ll refine this as we do interviews, but this is a good starting point that will\ngive us a sense of what customers think about the whole experience, if there\u2019s\nanother pain point that comes up commonly, and if communicating with\nmoving companies to figure out details really was a pain point.\nWe\u2019ll also want to reach out to customers who leaked from the funnel at the\nphone-call step to see what was painful about that step. Those interview", "questions will be similar, but we\u2019ll ask questions about what they did to book\nthe move instead of using Moover and what about the phone-call step\nspecifically caused them to choose that alternative.\nAfter doing these customer interviews, if in-app messaging still looks like\nthe biggest pain point, we\u2019ll look at the development effort needed to build it.\nIf it\u2019s fairly low, we\u2019ll just build it. If it\u2019s high, we\u2019ll implement a Wizard of\nOz MVP next. The customer will send a message, we\u2019ll contact the moving\ncompany on the customer\u2019s behalf, and we\u2019ll reply to the customer on the\ncompany\u2019s behalf. We\u2019ll run this experiment for a while and see how the NPS\nnumbers change and if any customer explicitly comments on the in-app\nmessaging. Then we\u2019ll use that data to decide if we should build this feature\nfor real.<<<SECTION_BREAK>>>\n________ \nCHAPTER FOUR TIP\nThis chapter\u2019s tip comes to us from Nik Laufer-Edel.

To do that\nwe know we first have to understand our users. We know we should validate our riskiest assumptions.\nWe know we should gain confidence that our problem makes sense to work on and that our solutions\nactually solve the problem. But there\u2019s more we need to know to make good product decisions.\nOver the years, I\u2019ve designed a simple customer-journey model to remind myself of the context needed\nto define problems and evaluate solutions. The base of the model came about during two years I spent\ndoing customer-development research at an early-stage start-up. It\u2019s evolved since to incorporate some\nof the research around motivation theory as well as concepts discussed in the realm of the Jobs to Be\nDone framework.\nAssuming you\u2019re not trying to create an entirely new behavior, the model acts as a reminder that your\nusers already have a perspective on the problem you\u2019re solving, a way in which they measure success,\nand a means by which they work towards that desired state. These are the basic building blocks of\nunderstanding users and today this information is often captured in personas, metrics, and user flows.\nWhat can be missing from these artifacts is what motivates users to make progress towards a desired\nstate and what holds them back.\nYou can use this model of the customer journey as your North Star when articulating or reflecting on\nany product initiative.\nCURRENT STATE", "What\u2019s the users\u2019 current perspective of the problem? How do they think and feel about it?\nJourney\nWhat are the current steps they take? This is often the flow of your application but might also\ninclude taking steps outside of your app or using competitors.\nMOTIVATION\nWhat about the current solution are they not happy with?\nWhat about the new solution is uniquely appealing?\nDo they believe that following the journey will get them to the desired state?\nDo they believe they have the ability to do what will be asked of them at each step?\nDo they believe they will be supported if they run into problems?\nHINDERANCES\nWhat about the current solution do they like?\nWhat about switching to the new solution worries them?\nDesired State\nHow do they measure success? What is winning?\nHow does getting to this state move them closer to other, larger goals?\nI start all initiatives by drawing out the model to align the team and develop research questions. For\nmature products and iterations on existing features you may already be able to speak to all parts of the\nmodel. For new products or features you\u2019ll discover gaps in the team\u2019s knowledge or risky assumptions\nto tackle through internal or external validation. Ultimately, understanding what winning is for your\ncustomer, their current situation, and the factors that will help them or hinder them from making progress\nwill equip you and your team to make better product decisions. Good luck!<<<SECTION_BREAK>>>", "Finding and validating the right oppor tunity to work on next has gotten you to\nthe starting line of the product-development life cycle. Now we need to run\nthe race and actually build the product. In this chapter we\u2019ll look at how to\ntransition from an oppor tunity to something actionable, and in Chapters 6\nthrough 8 we\u2019ll dive into the entire \u201cget it built and launched\u201d process.\nFundamentally, this chapter is about an important PM soft skill\u2014\ncommunication\u2014and how to effectively communicate, discuss, and finalize\nthe oppor tunity you\u2019ve found with key stakeholders.\nWHY NEW IDEAS STRUGGLE", "A product manager\u2019s job includes anticipating what might cause the product\nto flop and addressing that risk up front. The biggest reason new products\nstruggle isn\u2019t a technical reason\u2014it\u2019s because customers don\u2019t want or need\nthe product you end up building. In other words, it happens because you don\u2019t\nachieve product/market fit. Fortunately, there are things you can do to give\nyour product the best possible chance of success.\nTaking steps to validate your idea, like we went over in Chapter 4, will\nhelp get your product started the right way, as you\u2019ll have made sure there\nwill be some need for your product or feature\u2014from this point we\u2019ll say\n\u201cproduct\u201d for simplicity. But numerous issues that might crop up and prevent\nyour finished product from achieving product/market fit, as you go from\n\u201cidea that we believe customers want\u201d to released product. It\u2019s your job to\nanticipate and prevent these issues before they cause harm to your product.\nHere\u2019s an example. What if there\u2019s a hidden barrier you never learned about\nor addressed that prevents customers from using your product? Remember\nthe Kano model from Chapter 3? There are often basic expectations that a\ncustomer won\u2019t explicitly mention, but if your product is missing those\nfeatures, the customer will be unhappy and might not even use it. Imagine if\nyou booked a hotel room and there was no bed. Or toilet paper. Or sink.\nWould you stay or would you immediately go to another hotel? Early test\nphases with key customers as you build your product can help make sure you\ndon\u2019t miss a hidden barrier.\nBut hidden barriers are just one thing that might prevent you from achieving\nproduct/market fit. Other obstacles include the following:\nIt takes you so long to build and release your product that your\ncustomers\u2019 needs have changed or they found a better solution.", "Your product has so many features, new customers can\u2019t figure out\nhow to use it, quickly getting frustrated and abandoning it. Or if\nyou\u2019re adding a new feature to an existing product, perhaps it ends up\nbeing hidden where no one finds it.\nThe product\u2019s value wasn\u2019t even clear in the first place, and\ncustomers didn\u2019t purchase it because they didn\u2019t realize it would\naddress their needs.\nTo be fair, you won\u2019t be able to anticipate every possible obstacle, nor does\nanyone expect you to\u2014that\u2019s what iteration is about. However, as you start to\nbuild your product, there are steps you can take that will give your product\nthe best chance of success possible. These steps start with writing a few key\ndocuments that will help you clearly establish your goals and desired\noutcomes, create empathy for your customers, and allow for clear\ncommunication with stakeholders. Those traits combine to help you and your\nteam make smart decisions as you build your product, giving it the best\nchance of success.<<<SECTION_BREAK>>>\nWORKING BACKWARDS BY IMAGINING THE FUTURE\nBuilding something new involves imagining the future and making it happen.\nWe frequently find it useful to start development on a new product by\ndescribing what the world will be like when the product\u2019s done. Imagine\nyou\u2019re writing a science fiction story about a near-future world with your\nproduct.\nThere are two great \u201cimagine the future\u201d documents to try writing before\nanyone\u2019s written a line of code. These documents are a press release and a\nproduct review. Amazon often has its product managers write a press release", "when starting development. But press releases are internally focused, and\nthey cover how you imagine talking about the product when it\u2019s done. Writing\nthe product review you want to receive before starting development forces\nyou to think about how you want the product to be perceived externally when\nit\u2019s done.\nBoth of these documents are useful to write, as they help answer key\nquestions up front and help communicate with key stakeholders. When you\nstart to build a new product, writing these documents forces you to take your\nproduct ideas out of your head and get them down on paper, making it much\neasier to share your ideas with other stakeholders. Furthermore, writing\ndown your ideas will help ensure you have initial answers for important\nproduct questions like, \u201cWhat are the key features customers will care about\nthat we\u2019ll want to promote?\u201d\nOver time, as you build out the product, come back to the review and the\npress release, and update them whenever you\u2019re at a critical decision point.\nHow do these documents change if you choose not to build a specific feature,\nfor example? If you\u2019re unhappy with how your review is changing, what can\nyou do to get it back on a good t rack?<<<SECTION_BREAK>>>\nWriting an Internal Future Press Release\nWhile not the most fun prose-wise to write, writing a press release before\nyou start product development forces you to explicitly write dow n your target\nmarket, the problem you\u2019re addressing, how you\u2019re solving it, and the key\nfeatures of the solution\u2014succinctly, in less than a page.\nSharing the press release with stakeholders, including the engineering and\ndesign leads, will also help you start to uncover any internal barriers and\nfigure out what questions you need to answer before the team can start fully", "building this product. Perhaps this product relies on building a new piece of\ntechnology, and you need the engineering team\u2019s help to build a prototype to\nsee if it\u2019s even technically feasible. You\u2019ll need to find time on their\nschedule, and that prototype will be a milestone towards the overall project,\naffecting the release date even before you\u2019ve started planning the project.\nWriting a press release will also help you start to determine how you\ncommunicate the product\u2019s value to customers, along with how customers\nwill find and get started using the product. You\u2019ll likely change both of those\nas you actually build the product, but thinking about them up front helps\naddress two major reasons products flop.\nFurthermore, it\u2019s one final validation step to make sure this is really what\nyou want to do next. If you\u2019re not excited to write this press release, and no\none is excited to read it, are you working on the right oppor tunity? Is there\nsomething else you would be excited to write, and excited for customers to\nread?\nSimilarly, ask yourself if the product described in the press release really\nwill help you hit your goals. You could try writing a press release as if you\nachieved your goal. For example, if your goal is to grow your engaged\ncustomer base to a certain target number, write a press release about how\nyou\u2019ve hit that milestone and the role this product played in hitting it. If the\npress release feels contrived or very hard to write, then perhaps this product\nisn\u2019t the right thing to build to help you achieve your goals.\nA basic product press release usually includes these elements:\nHeadline: If you were to tell your friend about this product in a sentence,\nwhat would you say? Included in that is the key target market, how it helps\nthem win, and a tentative product name that the target market can", "understand. Sometimes you will need two sentences, in which case you\nshould write a headline and a subheading.\nSummary paragraph: The first full paragraph in your press release should\ncall out the most important aspects of the product and how it solves the\ncustomer\u2019s problem. Imagine you\u2019re reading this press release on Flipboa rd\nor Apple News\u2014most people will read only this first paragraph, so it\nneeds to be concise but complete.\nProblem and solution: The next section should elaborate on the problem\nand your solution in more detail.\nSpokesperson quote: Include a quote from you, the product manager, about\nhow this product is great for your customers. It\u2019s fine to include this in the\nsolution text.\nCustomer quote: Include a quote from a fictional customer about how the\nproduct fits into his life.\nConclusion/how to get started: Explain how new customers can find/sign\nup/buy/use this product, and pull everything together with a call to action.\nIf you find you need to write more to help make your thoughts about the\nproduct clear, especially around issues that relate internally to your company\nand how you\u2019ll get the product built rather than around issues related to the\ncustomer, then also write a product FAQ document.\nWriting a Review\nThe other \u201cimagine the future\u201d document you might write at the start of the\nproject, especially for a major new version of a product or a brand-new", "product, is the review you want your product to receive. Imagine if Recode,\nor whomever is appropriate, were reviewing the released version of your\nproduct\u2014what would they say?\nIn a press release you think about how you want to talk about your product,\nbut a review forces you to think about what customers will hear and how\nthey\u2019ll experience the product. Therefore, this is where you need to be honest\nabout what tradeoffs you\u2019re willing to make with the product. Maybe your\nproduct will be amazing but also pricier than the competitors. The reviewers\nwill call this out\u2014Are you OK with that? If not, and you start taking steps to\nreduce its price, what tradeoffs will occur? Will you need more customers to\nmake up for lost revenue? Is that achievable? Will you need to reduce the\nfeature set? What impact would that have on the review?\nSimilarly, what parts of your product do you think a reviewer will focus on,\nand which will they ignore? The parts you discuss the most are the parts\nwhere you\u2019ll later spend most of your design and engineering effort.\nMostly importantly, the review should have a conclusion about why a\ncustomer should buy your product, especially over a competitor\u2019s or\nwhatever the customer is doing now. This conclusion should reflect the\nunique, differentiating value your product offers. If it\u2019s something minor, such\nas identical features at a slightly lower cost, then your product might struggle\nto stand out\u2014if a competitor has a sale, there\u2019s suddenly no difference in\nyour products, and you\u2019ll be seen as a copycat.\nWriting that conclusion will force you to connect the concepts in the\nprevious three chapters: What are your company\u2019s core competencies? How\ndo those connect to this oppor tunity? For example, especially at first, Google\nDocs was much more limited than Microsoft Word. But it was cloud-based,\ncollaborative, and platform-agnostic\u2014in addition to being free. Those three", "factors are how Google used its strengths to build a differentiated word\nprocessor. If it had been a free app you downloaded and installed on your\nMac or PC, a review would\u2019ve concluded that it was a very limited free\nword processor, and that\u2019s it\u2014that product wouldn\u2019t have taken advantage of\nGoogle\u2019s strengths.\nJust like your press release, your review should be concise. Most product\nreviews don\u2019t exhaustively look at every feature. They give customers\nenough information to help them know what problem the product solves, if it\nsolves the problem well, what tradeoffs the product has, and if they should\nbuy the product.<<<SECTION_BREAK>>>\nDefining a Minimum Viable Product\nClearly defining the MVP you want to ship and working backwards to\ndetermine how to achieve it is another way to help set your product up for\nsuccess. In Chapter 4 we talked about using one type of MVP\u2014simple ones\nhacked together and not built like the actual product\u2014to validate your\noppor tunity hypothesis. Now let\u2019s look at MVPs from a \u201cwhat will we\nactually build?\u201d perspective.\nAs you wrote your press release and product review, you were forced to\npick out the most important parts of your product to talk about. The single\nmost important aspect of your product, the one that delivers the real value for\nyour customers, is the starting point to define the MVP. You\u2019ll prioritize\nbuilding that part first, and at some companies that will also be the initial\nproduct you release.\nBefore we go further, let\u2019s clear up a big misconception about MVPs.\nMinimum doesn\u2019t mean bad. Your product is still going to be designed and\nengineered well, tested thoroughly, and, most importantly, it will deliver", "value to the user. It should be a product that people are willing to buy and\nuse. Even if it\u2019s not fully featured, it should work well enough that it becomes\nyour customers\u2019 go-to solution.\nImagine a product that has only one button. It\u2019s easy for customers to use\nthis product, because their only option is to press a button. Now imagine you\nadd a second button. Suddenly the product is a lot harder to use because\ncustomers have to choose which button to push. Every button or feature you\nadd increases the friction for customers\u2014it makes them have to think more\nabout what they\u2019re doing.\nMinimum simply means the fewest buttons or features you need to build to\ndeliver the most important value. This prevents you from building features\nthat no one ends up using, or, worse, making the product so complex a\ncustomer doesn\u2019t use it at all. In an ideal world with lean methodology,\nyou\u2019ll release your MVP to real customers and then determine what to do\nnext based on what they\u2019re actually doing with the product and what\nlimitations they encounter. In other words, you\u2019re always just building MVPs\nand iterating.\nUnfortunately, we often end up in non-ideal situations where we iterate less\nfrequently, like building a major new version of our product, and we\u2019ll be\nexpected to ship more than just the pure MVP. In these cases, defining the\nMVP will help you prioritize the pieces you absolutely have to build to\ndeliver on the product. For the beyond-MVP features, rather than arbitrarily\npicking features to build, test your MVP with key customers before release.\nThen, use their feedback to figure out what extra features to prioritize. Even\nthough the end release will be more than an MVP, this approach helps you\nuse an MVP internally, effectively.\nSo how do you come up with your MVP? Using your press release and", "product reviews as a guide, let\u2019s make a list about your product.\n1. Write down the overall thing you\u2019re doing and why you\u2019re doing it.\nThat is, what value will it deliver for your customers and what goal\nwill it help you achieve? Explicitly put this statement at the top.\n2. List the features you think you need to achieve that top-level goal,\nalong with why that feature\u2019s important. Rather than just writing\n\u201ccloud data store,\u201d write \u201ccloud data store so that customers can\naccess their data from any device.\u201d\nNow here\u2019s the kicker: as you work on this step, you\u2019re not allowed\nto add any new feature category not listed in the press release and\nproduct review. You\u2019ll define each feature in more detail (e.g., you\nmight need a way to log in, so that people can access your service,\nand a way to reset passwords), but you can\u2019t add something major.\nFor example, if you wrote a fictional press release about the iPhone\n5S and never mentioned Touch ID, you can\u2019t suddenly list Touch ID\nas part of the MVP. Whether you realized it or not, writing the press\nrelease and review helped you prioritize the most important parts of\nyour product, which in turn helps define the MVP.\n3. Go through your feature list and cross out whatever items customers\ndon\u2019t actually require to address their core need. This step is the\nreally hard part\u2014MVPs should be uncomfortable. You as the product\nmanager should feel like the MVP is not feature-rich enough, but\nthere should be enough functionality that customers can accomplish\ntheir goals. For example, even though two-factor authentication is\nmore secure, is it really critical to your customer or can it have a", "lower priority?\nEliminating features might even eliminate certain personas from\nusing your product. That\u2019s OK, as long as it doesn\u2019t prevent your key\ntarget market from using the product. If your product is very risky,\nsuch as relying on technology engineering hasn\u2019t built yet, you might\neven define a \u201csingle use case MVP,\u201d which can be used by only one\npersona for one situation\u2014a risky one. If the MVP works for the key\nmarket, then over time you can build the needed features to support\nmore personas.\nBy the time you\u2019re done, you should have what you believe is a clearly\ndefined MVP, along with explanations about why each feature is part of the\nMVP.<<<SECTION_BREAK>>>\nMVPs, Plussing, and the Kano Model\nWe love MVPs because they let you focus on delivering a product your\ncustomers want and will use. But remember, minimum doesn\u2019t mean bad. You\nneed to be continuously seeking ways to make sure what you\u2019re doing is\ngreat. In Chapter 3 we talked about the Kano model, and we introduced the\nidea of delighter features, features that customers don\u2019t ask for but that\ndeliver a huge return in customer satisfaction.\nAs you\u2019re defining your MVP, it\u2019s easy to inadvertently dismiss delighter\nfeatures as non-essential work, after all, customers aren\u2019t explicitly asking\nfor them. But it\u2019s your job as a PM to advoc ate and to keep these features\npart of the MVP when possible, as they\u2019re critical to building innovative,\ndifferentiated products that your customers love.\nTo help you think about these features, we want to share an idea from Walt", "Disney. He came up with the idea of \u201cplussing,\u201d which is simply finding\nways to make a good idea great and to deliver beyond what people expect.\nSound familiar?\nDisney historian Les Perkins tells a story from the early days of Disneyland.\nWalt was holding a Christmas parade, which cost $350,000. His accountants\nbegged him not to spend that money, because people would already be in the\npark. Walt\u2019s reply was, \u201cThat\u2019s just the point. We should do the parade\nprecisely because no one\u2019s expecting it. Our goal at Disneyland is to always\ngive the people more than they expect. As long as we keep surprising them,\nthey\u2019ll keep coming back. But if they ever stop coming, it\u2019ll cost us ten times\nthat much to get them to come back.\u201d\nTo this day, The Walt Disney Company\u2019s culture has integrated plussing in\neverything they do. At a park, a cast member might go out of his way to\nunexpectedly help your family skip a long line, and this unexpected delight\nmakes your day even more awesome. The sunken ship and sharks explosion\nsequence in Finding N emo was a lot of fun, and the final shot with two birds\nsitting on the water completely plusses it (we\u2019re not going to spoil the\nsurprise in case you haven\u2019t seen it). The results of continuously delivering\nmore than people expect, in both revenue and customer satisfaction, speak for\nthemselves\nWhen you\u2019re defining your MVP, an extra filter as you\u2019re cutting potential\nfeatures is to ask, \u201cDoes this plus the core idea?\u201d If it really does, spend\nsome extra time considering if you should cut it or not. Conversely, if you\u2019re\nstruggling to find ways to define delighter ideas, ask yourself, \u201cHow could I\nplus this?\u201d\nWhile plussing is arguably not fully in line with lean thinking, you\u2019ll likely\ndiscover that plussing your initial MVP is key to building products that", "customer\u2019s don\u2019t just use, but also love.\nNext, let\u2019s look at how to effectively discuss the MVP and the project as a\nwhole with other stakeholders.<<<SECTION_BREAK>>>\nCOMMUNICATING VIA A PRODUCT REQUIREMENTS\nDOCUMENT\nOne of the most importantly tools to help you communicate is a well-written\nproduc t requirements document (PRD). A PRD is an explanation of the\nspecific product you\u2019re building. It clearly explains why you\u2019re building this\nproduct, both for your internal goals and for your customers, along with the\nexact scope\u2014the features and functionality\u2014of the product. Similarly, it\nshould convey what you\u2019re not building.\nFor better or worse, PRDs have become a controversial topic in the\nproduct-management world. In very waterfall-oriented companies, a PM will\nspend a long time writing a very detailed PRD. These huge documents, often\n20 pages or more, specify every aspect of a product up front, they are\ndifficult to read, and they are essentially immutable once finished\u2014this is\nwhat the team is going to implement no matter what. Advoc ates of lean\nmethodology use the PRD as an example of everything wrong with waterfall\ndevelopment. Specifically, they believe in quick iteration and using new\nknowledge to plan what to do next, and long and detailed specifications for\nwhat you\u2019ll do a re contrary to that approach.\nWe believe that a PRD, if done well, is a fantastic communication tool, and\nwe\u2019re going to help you create effective ones that others will read.\nFurthermore, we view a PRD as a living document. You\u2019ll update it as the\nproject progresses, documenting changes in scope along with key decisions\nand fleshing it out with relevant information like user design tests. Unlike", "when product management first emerged and people created detailed PRDs\nbefore a project began, we believe that the PRD is finished only when the\nproduct\u2019s released.\nThe PRD is a tool for everyone involved in the product. At first you\u2019ll use\nit to get all the key stakeholders on the same page and help the team\nunderstand the project. Having an initial PRD can be reassuring and inspire\nconfidence in your project, as it\u2019s clear to others in the company that you\nhave an idea for where to take the project. We believe that, throughout the\nproject, the PRD should be the project\u2019s home page\u2014or at least the very first\nlink on the project\u2019s homepage. As you near release, your support and sales\nteams will use it to find out everything they need to know about the product.\nAnd when you\u2019re done, it\u2019s a historical reference for why you made certain\ndecisions.\nWe should mention that you won\u2019t need a PRD\u2014or an imaginary press\nrelease/product review\u2014for every oppor tunity you pursue. A bug fix, for\nexample, won\u2019t need a PRD. There\u2019s no exact division as to when you do\nand don\u2019t need to write a PRD. Our recommendation is to write one for any\noppor tunity that is more of a project, involving communication between\nvarious teams and pot ential confusion rather than a clear, small change.\nLet\u2019s look at what goes into a PRD and how to use it as a communications\ntool.<<<SECTION_BREAK>>>\nBreaking Down a PRD\nThese are the key sections in a PRD:\nTitle: Give this project a distinct name.\nChange history: Provide a description of each important change to the", "PRD, including who changed it, when, and in what specific way.\nOverview: Briefly, what is this project about? Why are you doing it?\nObjectives: What will this let the customer do? What are our high-level\ninternal goals for doing this project?\nSuccess metrics: What are the success metrics that indicate you\u2019re\nachieving your internal goals for the project?\nMessaging: What\u2019s the product messaging marketing will use to describe\nthis product to customers, both new and existing?\nTimeline/release planning: What\u2019s the overall schedule you\u2019re working\ntowards?\nPersonas: Who are the target personas for this product, and which is the\nkey persona?\nUser scenarios: These are full stories about how various personas will use\nthe product in context.\nRequirements/features in: These are the distinct, prioritized features\nalong with a short explanation as to why the features are important.\nFeatures out: What have you explicitly decided not to do a nd why?\nDesigns: Include any needed early sketches, and link to the actual designs\nonce they\u2019re available.\nOpen issues: What factors do y ou still need to figure out?", "Q&A: What are common questions about the product, and answers to those\nquestions?. This is a good pl ace to note key decisions.\nOther considerations: This is a catch-all for anything else, such as if you\nmake a key decision to remove or add to the project\u2019s scope.<<<SECTION_BREAK>>>\nThe exact format of a PRD varies company to company, but the overall\ncontent is similar. Let\u2019s dig into each section in more detail.\nTitle and Change History\nThe PRD\u2019s header contains the title, which is a unique, identifying name for\nthe project. This might be a code name or it might be something simple, like\n\u201cMoove r Web App\u201d for the first version.\nThe change history is just a way to quickly tell if there\u2019s new information so\nthat readers don\u2019t have to reread the entire document only to find out\nnothing\u2019s changed. Some wiki tools have automatic change-tracking widgets,\nso if you\u2019re writing your PRD online, this section is automatically written for\nyou.\nOverview and Objectives\nNext, you write an overview paragraph that will be very similar to the first\nparagraph of the press release you wrote. It will describe what this project is\nand why you\u2019re doing it now. You\u2019ll also create a short bulleted list\nexplicitly listing what you want the customer to get out of this project and\nwhat internal goals you\u2019re trying to achieve\u2014your objectives.\nSuccess Metrics\nYou\u2019ll also explicitly list the most important success metrics, the key\nperformance indicators that you will need to be able to measure to figure out", "if you\u2019ve achieved our goals.\nAs you start to write the PRD, you might find you have a general sense of\nyour goals (increase the number of users), but not necessarily a detailed goal\n(increase our user base by 10%). Write whatever you can and add some\nplaceholder indicator, like \u201c???\u201d if you\u2019re not certain or need to more clearly\ndefine something. You will also call out this uncertainty in the \u201cOpen Issues\u201d\nsection.\nNew PMs often make the mistake of listing every possible metric they could\nmeasure. Instead, focus on the key success metrics you want to watch for, and\nlater in the PRD as part of the features section or within the Q&A, list the\nspecific metrics you want to measure that will affect the success metrics.\nMessaging\nMessaging is how you\u2019ll explain the product to a current or new customer in\na short sentence, and we\u2019ll cover it more in Chapter 8. It\u2019s quite likely that\nyour product messaging won\u2019t be clearly defined at the start of the project.\nTake a stab at writing something, indicate it is tentative/uncertain, if it is, and\nadd figuring out the exact messaging to the \u201cOpen Issues\u201d section.\nTimeline/Release Planning\nEven though you\u2019re most likely not acting as a project manager and owning\nthe project schedule, you\u2019ll want to include some rough timing information\nhere and eventually provide a link to the full schedule. Maybe your marketing\nand sales team want to release the product for a holiday push\u2014this means it\nneeds to be for sale by mid-November. Knowing that date might significantly\nimpact your development planning and how much you\u2019re able to build and\ntest in time.", "Personas\nCall out the key personas this product is intended for. If you have personas\ndefined elsewhere, link to the full personas and remind the reader of the key\ntraits in the PRD. If they\u2019re not fully defined elsewhere, define them here so a\nreader understands what the eventual customers will be like, and their goals.<<<SECTION_BREAK>>>\nUser Scenarios and Storytelling\nNow we come to the secret sauce of our PRD format: user scenarios. We\nbelieve user scenarios will help you write PRDs a cut above  everyone\nelse\u2019s, making people want to read them. In a user scenario, you\u2019ll combine\npersonas, customer development, and empathy to write full-paragraph stories\nabout how your customers will use your product in different scenarios.\nStories are the oldest form of entertainment we have, and scientists have\nargued that narrative experiences are the basis for far more of our lives than\nsystematic logic. Think about the last bad presentation you saw. Chances are\nthe presenter had slides chock-full of bullet points and just read each\none. After three minutes, you were checking your email, daydreaming about\nbeing anywhere but in that seat. And when you looked at the bottom of his\nslides and saw \u201c3/101,\u201d  you started praying for a fire to get out of the\nroom. Poorly presented content can make even the most fascinating of\nsubjects boring.\nConversely, think about a TED Talk. These presenters easily hold your\nattention for 15\u201320 m inutes and make you want to hear more. Each starts with\nthe presenter sharing a personal detail about her life, and the slides, if there\nare any, are images with no text. Instead of reading bullets, we listen to the\nworld the presenter crafts for us and imagine ourselves in it. TED Talks are\nformatted as stories, and these stories engage our brains.", "There\u2019s scientific evidence that our brains are wired to think in stories, not\nlists of bullets. Scientists have found that just reading a list of bullet points\nactivates the language-processing parts of the brain (Broca\u2019s area and\nWernicke\u2019s area), but when we read a story, areas in the brain that we\u2019d use\nwhen experiencing the events are activated, too. If we read about a person\nwalking down the street, the same parts of the brain that activate when we\nwalk down the street will activate. Stories let us imagine another\u2019s\nexperience.\nOne of the big reasons a product manager needs to communicate effectively\nis to make everyone on the team empathetic with the customer so that they can\nclearly understand the customer\u2019s needs and how the product fits into his life.\nWriting stories to talk about the customer and the product you\u2019re building is\nthe most effective way to help your team empathize with the customer\nbecause it makes your teams\u2019 brains behave as if they\u2019re the customer,\nimplicitly communicating the results of your customer-development work.\nStorytelling also provides a way to take vague oppor tunities and raw data\nand make sense of it. When we\u2019re young, we\u2019re taught that there\u2019s one right\nanswer to a problem. 2 + 2 = 4. Even in English class, we\u2019re taught to write\nto one right answer: write an intro, hypothesis, supporting data, and\nconclusion. The way most schools work are a relic of preparing students to\nwork on assembly lines where there is only one way to do e ach task.\nProduct management isn\u2019t like that. We have a lot of seemingly\ndisconnected data that we have to weave together to create a product\nnarrative. And there\u2019s not always one perfectly clear, right answer for every\nproblem. Instead, we want to focus on the customer\u2019s underlying needs and\nmotivations to make sure whatever answers Design and Engineering come up\nwith will solve the problem. Stories are an effective way to give meaning to", "data and to express that need in an understandable way. They let us imagine a\nworld that doesn\u2019t exist and think about the steps we\u2019ll take to get there\u2014\nwhich is also useful when crafting a product roadmap.\nWriting user scenarios is a great way to turn a list of customer needs and\nproduct requirements into a format that others will understand and want to\nread. Storytelling will help you not only craft great PRDs but also give\neffective presentations, explain your product clearly, and more.<<<SECTION_BREAK>>>\nCrafting Great Stories\nFortunately, good stories aren\u2019t hard to write! By reading book s, watching\nmovies, and just being human, you already implicitly know how to tell a\ngreat story. Let\u2019s make that knowledge explicit. All stories have a similar\nstructure. They first give you context: they set up the world. For a user\nscenario, who\u2019s the persona? Remind us quickly about the customers that\npersona represents. What situation is he in? What are the key details we need\nto know\u2014Is he in his car? Holding a baby?\nThe transition from the setup to the next part of the story, action, is the\n\u201cinciting incident.\u201d The inciting incident is when conflict shows up. What\nproblem causes the persona to need your product, or to need a specific\nfeature in your product if he was already using it in the setup? Why does he\nthink to use your product? If he\u2019s a new customer, how will he find/buy your\nproduct?\nNow is the action section. This is where \u201cstuff\u201d happens. When the persona\nis using the product, what\u2019s he doing? What happens as he tries to use it?\nWhat roadblocks or conflicts does he encounter while trying to use the\nproduct, and what product features help him eliminate those roadblocks? In a\nuser scenario, this is where you\u2019ll justify why various other features are", "important.\nFinally, what\u2019s the result? Now that he\u2019s addressed his need, how does his\nworld change? It\u2019s fine if it\u2019s a small change, not every product is saving the\nworld. \u201cHaving scratched his itch with the Acme backscratcher, Jeff puts his\nbackscratcher down within easy reach, knowing it\u2019s the perfect tool to\nscratch his back.\u201d Hopefully you see how even that simple result implies that\nwe\u2019ll achieve a customer satisfaction/engagement goal in the end.\nSetup. Action. Result. That\u2019s it. The challenge is in the execution! As you\nwrite the story, include the relevant details to help a reader imagine the\nsituation you\u2019re describing, but just like when writing personas, you don\u2019t\nneed to include every possible detail. If you\u2019re not sure what to include, start\nby writing a detailed story and then begin eliminating details. If the overall\nmeaning doesn\u2019t change and the customer need/how the product addresses it\nis still clear, then you likely don\u2019t need those details.\nWrite your stories so that if a customer in your target persona were to read\nit, she\u2019d go, \u201cI\u2019ve been in that situation before, and this product sounds\nfantastic!\u201d Also, your customers likely don\u2019t know your jargon, so avoid\nusing it as much as possible. This will also help other stakeholders to\nunderstand the story clearly\u2014there\u2019ll be no ambiguity because you used\njargon they don\u2019t recognize.\nLast, as we\u2019ve mentioned before, be authentic. You want your stories to be\nreal and believable, as that will help you figure out your potential\nweaknesses, both in terms of execution and where your customer might\nencounter friction. Once you know your weaknesses, you can take steps to\naddress them!\nLike product management, crafting great stories is easy to learn but can take\na lifetime to master. Keep using stories for your PRDs, presentations, and", "more, and you\u2019ll become a better and better storyteller.<<<SECTION_BREAK>>>\nWriting User Scenarios\nIn a PRD, you\u2019ll likely write multiple user scenarios covering different\npersonas and their use cases. Your MVP definition will help you figure out\nthe most important stories to write and what features to focus on in those\nstories\u2014each use case or major aspect of a use case will be one user\nscenario. If you find yourself not mentioning features that are on your MVP\nlist, adjust your list accordingly. Everything in your MVP list should be in the\nuser scenarios, but not every feature called out in the user scenarios will be\npart of the MVP. If you narrate how each feature will help the user win\u2014that\nis, how will customers will use it to address their problems\u2014you\u2019ll make\nthe feature\u2019s value clear to your readers. For new products or features, don\u2019t\nforget about the onboarding part of the user scenario: How will a customer\nfirst encounter this product and learn to use it?\nThere are three key tips to keep in mind when writing user scenarios. First,\nremember that your goal is to make readers feel like they\u2019re sitting next to\neach persona, using the product in each scenario. Provide the relevant detail\nso that readers know what\u2019s going on in the customer\u2019s life when they use the\nproduct, but don\u2019t drown the reader in unnecessary detail.\nSecond, you want these stories to be as truthful as you can imagine, as being\nauthentic will help you get the best possible understanding of your customer\nso that you can make smart product decisions\u2014we\u2019re reiterating this because\nit\u2019s that important. If one of your product requirements is a 100-page user\nmanual, is that reasonable? When was the last time you read a product\nmanual? Why should we believe the characters in your user scenario will\nread a long manual?", "We once read a PRD where each user scenario ended with \u201cand then the\ncustomer tells all her friends about the product and everyone buys one.\u201d\nWhile it\u2019s nice to have a happy ending, that wasn\u2019t authentic about what\npeople actually did! Instead, try to be realistic about what impact each\npersona\u2019s product use will have related to your goal. A realistic statement is,\n\u201cBecause this is an ongoing problem and the customer was so happy with our\ntrial product, she signed up for the monthly plan.\u201d\nBeing authentic can also help you eliminate unnecessary product features. If\nyou find yourself trying to force what you thought was a key feature into the\nstory, that\u2019s a great hint that the feature isn\u2019t essential.\nLast, do not define in too much detail or be too prescriptive about what the\nsolution entails. As we\u2019ll discuss more later, we want to leave the PRD\nfocused on goals and requirements rather than specific solutions to a\nproblem. Design and Engineering will figure out the right solution to help the\ncustomer achieve her goals and to meet your requirements. For example,\nrather than describing how a customer turns a doorknob on a restroom door\nto leave, describe how the customer exits the restroom with clean hands.\nMaybe Design will conclude that using her foot to open the door is a much\nbetter solution than a doorknob in this case. Being prescriptive to Design or\nEngineering is an easy way to get those teams annoyed with you\u2014you need\nto trust them to do t heir jobs.<<<SECTION_BREAK>>>\nRequirements/Features In and Features Out\nNext up in the PRD structure is a feature list, which is sometimes also called\na list of requirements or, more confusingly, user stories (these are not\nactually stories). This section is a list of what features you\u2019re going to build\ninto the product, ideally with some rough prioritizing around essential, really", "want, and nice to hav e.\nYou already have the basis for this: your MVP definition list. Each of the\nitems on your MVP list should be prioritized as essential. Your user\nscenarios will provide the rest of the list\u2014go back through them and\nexplicitly break down the prose into tasks. Note that the prioritization labels\naren\u2019t set in stone. As you develop the product and share early versions with\ncustomers for feedback, your feature prioritization will likely change.\nIt\u2019s OK if you don\u2019t have the full knowledge for how to break down the top-\nlevel tasks into specific subtasks. When you share the PRD with the design\nand engineering leads, you can work with them to break down each item into\nmore specific user stories.\nJust like the user scenarios, you\u2019ll want to avoid being prescriptive and\ninstead focus on goals and requirements. An easy way to do that is to write\neach item in this format: \u201cAs a <persona>, I want <specific feature goal> so\nthat <reason>.\u201d Some PMs prefer to use the Given-When-Then format:\n\u201cGiven <some context>, when <some action is done>, then <a set of\nobservable behaviors happens>.\u201d While Given-When-Then makes it easier\nthan other ways of writing requirements to tell when the user story is\nimplemented completely, be careful, as the When and Then blocks can easily\nbecome prescriptive.\nRegardless of what format you choose for your user stories, it should be\nclear what the feature will do and how to measure success/proper\nimplementation of the feature.\nWe\u2019ve found it also useful to explicitly list \u201cfeatures out\u201d\u2014that is, what\nyou\u2019re not doing and why. For one, multiple readers might ask about adding a\nfeature/supporting a use case, and this preempts the question. Second, if you\nchoose to reduce the scope of the product and cut out a feature, you will note", "the feature, that decision, and the date on this list. This list can also be a\nsource of inspiration for the next product iteration. It\u2019s also a great place to\nwrite down suggestions others give you that don\u2019t fit in the current scope so\nthat the people who made the suggestions feel like you listened to their\nfeedback.\nDesigns\nHaving defined the product\u2019s requirements, in the design section you start to\nlook at the solutions. Even though you don\u2019t want to be prescriptive,\nsometimes it\u2019s effective to create a low-quality, high-level \u201cnapkin sketch\u201d of\na possible design to help everyone understand what you\u2019re talking about. A\npicture can be worth a thousand words! The design section is the place to\ninclude those sketches.\nWe\u2019ll cover working with the design team in the next chapter, but we\nrecommend making these sketches very rough so the designers don\u2019t think\nyou\u2019re trying to do their job! And even if you were a designer before\nbecoming a product manager, you\u2019ll want to make your sketches rough. You\nneed to trust that the design team will do a better job designing a solution\nthan you will. You\u2019ll add links to the actual designs as they become\navailable.<<<SECTION_BREAK>>>\nOpen Issues, Q&A, and Other Considerations\nThe last few sections in the PRD are a catch-all. Especially on your first\ndraft, there are likely some parts of the project you\u2019re unsure of, from what\nyour specific success-metric goals are to if you should include a use case or\nnot. Note these questions under Open Issues.\nAs you discuss your PRD with others, you\u2019ll find some common questions", "come up again and again. Include a Q&A to provide the answers. If you\ncreated a product Q&A to go with the press release, you might already have\na good start to this section! The Q&A is also a great place to address edge\ncases\u2014how will you handle them?\nThe last part of the PRD is a general Other section in case something comes\nup that doesn\u2019t fit anywhere else. As you write the PRD, we recommend\nincluding all of these headers even if the only content is \u201cnothing yet\u201d so that\nthey\u2019re there when you need them.<<<SECTION_BREAK>>>\nUsing a PRD\nNow that you have a PRD, here\u2019s how to use it to get stakeholder buy-in and\nas a tool for communication with your team/company.\nWe recommend you write the first draft of your PRD in a private format,\nsuch as a Word doc or a non-public Google Doc. It will change the most in\nthe first few drafts, and you don\u2019t want someone stumbling upon it and\npanicking! You\u2019ll define the core of the product in these early drafts, and you\nwant to make sure everything on the page is coming from the work you\u2019ve\ndone to identify, validate, and scope the oppor tunity.\nAfter you\u2019ve written it, you\u2019ll start sharing it with others for feedback. Even\nthough you\u2019ll want to listen and address their feedback collaboratively,\nremember that product isn\u2019t design by committee. You\u2019re the person\nresponsible for the product, and you should approach these discussions from\na perspective of \u201cThis is what I believe is right. Did I miss anything?\u201d as\noppos ed to \u201cWhat do y ou think we should build?\u201d\nHowever, this does not mean you should approach this sharing process as\njust telling people, \u201cThis is what we\u2019re building. Now, go do i t.\u201d You\u2019ll want\nto solicit and address feedback, both to make the product better and to keep", "your relationship with various stakeholders productive and respectful.\nThe first people to share your PRD with are leads and fellow product\nmanagers. People who have been at the company longer, have experience\nwith the product, or have more experience in general might have valuable\ninsight to make the product\u2014or the path to getting it built\u2014be tter.\nOnce your team is on board, engage the other key stakeholders, such as the\ndesign and engineering leads. Again, view this as a conversation\u2014you\u2019re\nseeking their feedback, and you\u2019ll incorporate their thoughts into the PRD.\nPerhaps the engineering manager will note a technical issue you need to\nfigure out, and you\u2019ll add that to the Open Issues section. Or maybe the\ndesign lead will have an idea for a solution that changes the technical scope.\nMaybe the marketing lead will really want you to have something for a\ncertain release date. They might also ask you to break down one of your user\nstories into more detail to make the project\u2019s scope explicitly clear.\nSometimes you hear people say that a PM owns the problem, Design owns\nthe solution, and Engineering implements it. We\u2019ve found a much better\napproach is to define the problem and generate solutions together. You, the\nPM, might take the first stab at the problem\u2019s definition, but that doesn\u2019t mean\nwhat you write is perfect and that Design doesn\u2019t have valid input. Similarly,\nif you used to be an engineer, perhaps you\u2019ll have a valuable insight as to\nhow Engineering could implement a solution. When conflicts arise,\nremember your core role and focus on the product\u2019s requirements, not how to\nbuild it. A lot of conflict comes about when someone tries to do someone\nelse\u2019s job, such as a PM trying to design the solution or a designer wanting to\nchange the product\u2019s scope.\nAfter discussing the PRD with this group, you should all be in agreement\nabout what you\u2019re trying to build and why, along with what your key success", "metrics are. You should have a basic idea about if the project is feasible with\nthe defined scope and on the desired timeline. You\u2019ll also likely come up\nwith various questions and answers for the Q&A section, and the other leads\nmight have ideas that impact the user scenarios and feature list.\nNow is the time to start sharing the PRD more broadly. If you have an\ninternal wiki, move the PRD to a wiki page and make that the product\u2019s\nhomepage, or, at the very least, link to it from the product\u2019s homepage. Start\nsharing the PRD with the teams who will be working on it. Be sure to\nincorporate their feedback, as people in the weeds day to day often have\nvaluable practical insights.\nLast, it\u2019s quite possible that you\u2019ll be asked to share the PRD with a\nbroader group, be it at a company all-hands meeting or even at a board\nmeeting. In this situation, don\u2019t read the PRD or your user scenarios to the\naudience verbatim. Instead, distill the PRD down to the essence of what\nyou\u2019re doing and why, and present that information to the group. The press\nrelease you wrote can be a great guide. It\u2019s OK to call out specific things to\nmake the project\u2019s scope clear, but try to leave plenty of time for questions.\nAnd while you\u2019re sharing the PRD with broader audiences, the design and\nengineering teams are starting to actually work on the product! In the next\ncouple of chapters we\u2019ll look at how you\u2019ll work with them to shepherd the\nproduct.<<<SECTION_BREAK>>>\nMOOVER.IO\u2019S DOCUMENTS\nAfter validating the idea we came up with in Chapter 3, that Moover should\nadd in-app messaging so that customers don\u2019t have to play phone tag with\nmoving companies, we\u2019re going to clearly define our ideas. We\u2019ll do so by\nwriting an imaginary press release, working on an MVP list, and then writing", "the PRD.\nSample Press Release\nMove on Your Schedule With Moover\u2019s Latest Update\nThe leading app-based moving service now provides easy in-app communication with moving\ncompanies.\nMoover, the iPhone app bringing moving into the smartphone age, is proud to release its latest update.\nThis update removes the need to exchange phone calls and emails with moving companies, completely\ndigitizing the moving experience. Rather than having to schedule a phone call and email photos back in\nforth, with Moover you can now message with each moving company in-app, dealing with questions and\ncontracts at your convenience to finish planning your move.\nSince its release six months ago, Moover has transformed urban moving. Instead of having to search\nout moving companies, call them, and deal with an annoying game of phone tag just to get an accurate\nbid, Moover brings moving companies to you. Enter a few details about your home and when you want\nto move, and moving companies will compete for your business, with bids appearing in-app. The latest\nupdate simplifies the process by providing in-app messaging with each moving company so that you can\nshare photos and address your home\u2019s unique traits. This new feature ensures accountability and lets\nMoover guarantee that the bid you receive is the price you pay.\nProduct manager Jane Doe believes, \u201cin-app messaging is the biggest win for customers since we\nreleased Moover. It means you can provide answers to the moving company\u2019s questions when you\u2019re\nhome at night, thinking about the move, instead of having to stress during the day to call the moving\ncompany at work between meetings.\u201d\nRecent customer John Smith tried a prerelease version of messaging and \u201cstarted planning the move\nat 11pm, sent photos of the apartment two days later at 2am, and moved the next weekend.\u201d He went\non to share, \u201cThis is the third time I\u2019ve moved, and even though I have more furniture now than ever\nbefore, this was the first hassle-free move I\u2019ve had.\u201d\nDownload Moover from the App Store today to get started planning your first hassle-free move.\nSample MVP List\nGoal: Add in-app messaging so that customers cay stay in-app and don\u2019t", "have to exchange phone calls/emails with a moving company to get a bid or\ncomplete a move.\nMVP Requirements\nInitiate a conversation with the other party so that I can address\nquestions to provide a more accurate bid or finalize the moving\ndetails.\nSee when there are new messages so that I know I have information\nto deal with.\nRespond to messages to keep a thread going.\nFeatures We Removed from Moover\u2019s MVP\nSend documents like photos, videos, and PDFs as attachments to\nfurther help avoid email while communicating beyond words.\nSee a history of all communication/attachments with each company\nfor accountability and reference.\nSample PRD\nHere\u2019s what the first version of a PRD for our Moove r messaging feature\nlooks like. Notice how we call out an MVP with our prioritized-feature list\nin the PRD, and it\u2019s definitely an uncomfortable MVP. However, the PRD\ndoesn\u2019t just talk about the MVP features. It talks about a range of features to\ngive a complete view of the product and how the product manager expects\ncustomers to use all of the features together. Non-MVP features just have a\nlower priority in the requirements list.\nAs a product manager, you really hope Engineering will be able to do some", "of the lower-priority features to make the overall messaging feature more\nfunctionally complete. But, as long as you get the highest-priority features\ndone, all the personas will be able to achieve their goals, even if it takes a\nlittle more work than if every feature were implemented. This also gives you\nflexibility to release just the MVP version, get feedback, and then adjust what\nyou\u2019re working on next rather than building the entire PRD feature list before\nconsidering the product release-ready.\nTitle\nIn-App M essaging\nChange History\nFirst version\nOverview\nOur mission is to be the Uber of moving companies, making it convenient to\nbook  a move on your smartphone. We\u2019ve done a great job bringing the first\npart of moving to your fingertips\u2014finding vendors and getting initial rough\nbids\u2014bu t we\u2019ve found that there\u2019s a second part. Despite using Moove r, our\ncustomers still have to talk on the phone to figure out details, get exact bids,\nand finalize their moves. That means move prep still has to take place from 9\nto 5. We\u2019re going to bring the second part of the moving process into the\nsmartphone era by adding in-app messaging. This will make it convenient for\nour moving companies and customers to interact to plan details, allowing the\nmoving company to message from 9 to 5 and the customer to reply when\nconvenient.\nObjectives", "Improve customer satisfaction by continuing to reduce the hassle of\nmoving\nIncrease revenue by having more completed moves\nSuccess Metrics\nImprove the number of completed moves by a significant margin.\n[??? What\u2019s our precise goal? 10% ?]\nMessaging\nMoving on your schedule [???]\nTimeline/Release Planning\nSummer is a popu lar time to move, so we want to have at least the MVP done\nby May. That gives us about eight weeks. Ideally we will release the MVP by\nApril so that we have an iteration or two of the feature by the time the\nmoving season really starts.\nPersonas\nOur primary target is Ant Moving, our mid-sized moving company. They\u2019re\nthe ones who will have to ask for more information, so we need to make this\neasier for them than using the phone. Really Busy Rob is our second target,\nour persona who doesn\u2019t mind paying a premium to use app services over\ntraditional services. We\u2019ll need to provide an intuitive\nmessaging/notification system so that he doesn\u2019t have to look up a help page\nabout how to talk with the moving company.\nUser Scenarios", "Ant Answers a Bid\nLinda is the office manager at Ant Moving. Ant Moving signed up for\nMoove r when it first became available, and it\u2019s given the company a nice\nbump in its business: Moove r is now promoting Ant to potential clients,\nwithout Ant having had to do anything more. Linda is happy with Moove r and\nis willing to be a first adopter on new features to help the business keep\ngrowing.\nCurrently, Linda gets an email from Moove r when there\u2019s a new bid\nrequest. The email has the basic information for the bid and a link to the\nMoove r web dashboard. When Linda clicks the link, she\u2019s taken to a website\nthat lets her reply to the bid, see its status: unanswered, bid sent, or customer\naccepted/rejected. She can then link back to a master list of all bid requests\nreceived and the status.\nIf the customer accepts the bid, Linda then receives the customer\u2019s contact\ninfo, and she can call him to finalize details and give a more accurate bid.\nAlthough Linda\u2019s bids are pretty good, sometimes unexpected things happen.\nMoove r has the standard field for how many stairs are in each location, but it\ndoesn\u2019t account for tight staircases you can\u2019t fit furniture dow n, for example.\nNow, with Moover\u2019s latest version, when Linda gets a bid request she still\nlooks over the basic information and clicks a link to open the dashboard.\nHowever, there\u2019s a new group on the customer page with messaging\ninformation. Since she noticed the customer said he has stairs inside the\ncurrent unit, Linda uses the messaging tool to ask the customer if he could\ntake a photo of the stairwell and the rooms upstairs, with the furniture inside\nof them, so that Linda can look for any potential problems.\nRob is the customer book ing the move. He receives a notification that", "there\u2019s a new question waiting for him in Moove r. He checks it and makes a\nreminder to take photos when he\u2019s home that evening. At home, Rob takes\nand sends the requested photos to Ant.\nThe next day, Linda gets an email from Rob, via Moove r, with the requested\ninformation. The stairwell looks quite large, with no sharp turns, and there\u2019s\nno obnoxious furniture upstairs that could cause a problem. Linda determines\nher bid, provides it to Rob via the dashboard, and moves on to the next\npotential customer. Being an office manager at a moving company keeps\nLinda busy! She appreciates that the new Moove r messaging feature lets her\nnot play phone tag with customers, too!\nMoove r archives the conversation so that later, should Rob accept the bid\nand need to reference his photos, he can look them up on his customer page\non the web dashboard. Furthermore, Linda can continue the conversation\nwith Rob since he accepted the bid, finalizing any details. If he\u2019d rejected\nAnt\u2019s bid, Linda could see the previous conversation but not initiate a new\nconversation. While that means she can\u2019t reach out later and offer him a\ncoupon, it also provides her incentive to give Rob the best price up front.\nRob Answers Ant\u2019s Questions and Asks for Insurance\nInformation\nLiving in downtown Metropolis, Rob loves app services. He uses Lyft to get\naround, Rinse for his laundry, and more. He\u2019s about to move apartments\ndowntown, and he\u2019s trying Moove r for the first time.\nAfter downloading Moove r and answering a few questions about his old\nand new places, he sits back and waits to receive bids. The next day, he gets\na notification from Ant Moving asking to see photos of his staircase and\nupstairs rooms. No worries\u2014he takes the photos that night and sends them", "in-app to Ant. Ant gives him a bid, and it looks good.\nHowever, that afternoon he gets an email from his landlord, reminding him\nthat moving companies have to meet a certain minimum insurance\nrequirement to comply with the homeowner association (HOA) rules, and he\nhas to provide a copy of the company\u2019s insurance certificate unless it\u2019s an\nHOA-approved mover. Ugh! Ant isn\u2019t on the approved list, but its bid is half\nthe amount of the HOA-approved movers.\nRob goes to the Open Bids section on his app, and creates a new message\nto Ant. He provides them with the requirements, asks if they meet them, and\nasks if they\u2019d be willing to provide a copy of their insurance information for\nthe HOA if so.\nLinda at Ant gets the new message notification and is prepared. She\u2019s had\nthis request from other clients. She double-checks the numbers, Ant meets\nthem, and she replies with that confirmation. Since she already has a copy of\nAnt\u2019s insurance as a PDF, she attaches it for Rob, too.\nRob gets a notification about this reply, and when he checks it he sees that\neverything looks good. He even can open and save the PDF attachment. He\naccepts the bid and sends the insurance PDF to his landlord and the building\nHOA to get the move process started on their end.\nLinda promptly sends him the contract PDF. He saves it and signs it using a\nPDF app on his phone, and he sends the completed contract back to Linda via\nMoove r\u2019s message attachment feature.

As product managers, it\u2019s easy to focus\non the customer-facing side of defining the initial problem\u2014and then, later, actually overseeing the\nbuildout of the solution. But the portion of work and preparation in between can be the difference\nbetween a product properly launching to address the actual problem, and going off track before the\nbuild-out even begins.\nClearly defining the problem and requirements through well-organized documentation as described in\nthis chapter is one way to properly prepare your team. Consider supplementing your documentation with\nan experiential immersion with your entire team.\nAn experiential immersion is simply finding a real-world experience that your entire team can go\nthrough together that will allow you all to really live through the problem you\u2019re solving for. Even if your\nteam members are generally not your target market and aren\u2019t who you\u2019re designing your solution for,\nyou should all become method actors and live as if you were.\nIn the case of Moover, your team could actually become a moving company for a day. Set up a\nsimulated office for your moving company. Assign roles to different people\u2014including those who play\nthe customer. Spend a couple of hours doing the type of back-office work that you might envision at a", "Moover client moving company. If the Moover team were to go through this experiential immersion,\nthey might start to get an even keener understanding of why the problem they\u2019re solving for needs to be\naddressed. Or even better, it might bring up serious questions about whether any of your core\nassumptions about the problem you\u2019re solving for should be reconsidered.\nHow to do this?\n1. As a team, pick the core problem that you feel you\u2019re ultimately solving for.\n2. Identify a customer persona that experiences this problem often.\n3. Create a scenario where your team can \u201cact\u201d and simulate actually being the customer\nexperiencing the problem.\n4. Allow your team to live through this problem together for a while\u2014at least a couple of hours.\n5. Discuss as a team what it felt like to live the problem and whether any of your core\nassumptions have been even further validated, or need to be readdressed", "<<<SECTION_BREAK>>>So far, you\u2019ve been responsible for each step in the product-design life\ncycle. You\u2019ve found and validated an oppor tunity, communicated it to your\nstakeholders, and gotten everyone onboard. Now we\u2019ll shift into the\nexecution phase, which starts by figuring out the product\u2019s user experience\nwith the design team. A lot of thought goes into this phase to ensure we craft\na great product! Put another way, now that we\u2019ve figured out we\u2019re building\na house, we need to draw up blueprints and sketches, to figure out everything\nfrom where the toilets go, to how thick a wall needs to be to support the roof,\nto how we want to decorate", "WHAT IS USER EXPERIENCE DESIGN?\nPut simply, user experience (UX) design is about how we interact and\nengage with the product. Because building products is fundamentally about\nmaking a new experience or making an existing experience better, a good\nuser experience is fundamental to a great product. This includes everything\nfrom the box\u2014if there is one\u2014for the product, to how a customer achieves\nher goals within the product, to what the product looks and feels like.\nThere are two primary approaches to design. The first is that the customer\nshould adapt to the product, and the second is the product should work in a\nway the user expects/understands. For a long time, UX took a backseat to\nengineering. Because the engineers who built the product were also\nresponsible for the design, the UX directly represented how the product\nworked internally. In those cases, if there was a design team it was relegated\nto making nice icons for the interface the engineering team created. This is\nwhy many people think design is just about making something look pretty.\nPeople are adaptable, and this approach worked\u2014a nd continues to work\u2014\njust fine for many products, but the result is a product that most people don\u2019t\nwant to use. Figure 6-1 shows an application where the UX matches the\nengineering. Each field and option in the UX maps directly to the software\u2019s\ninternals, and the result is a confusing mess. With some time and effort (and\ncheat sheets), we all could figure out how to use this product, but very few of\nus would want to.\nOver the past few years, the second type of design, called user-centered\ndesign, has become far more popu lar, and it\u2019s what we\u2019ll focus on. In this\ntype of design, the product\u2019s UX is a well-thought-out solution to help the end\nuser effectively achieve her goal using the product. Compare the design of\nthe original iPhone to the Blackberry and other smartphones of the time, for", "example.\nFigure 6-1. This app\u2019s UX is a visual representation of its internals, and the results aren\u2019t pretty!\nIn many ways, Apple\u2019s iPod and iPhone are responsible for the design\npriority change. Mac OS put design front and center for years, always trying\nto create a great experience, thereby building a loyal customer base. But its\nmarket share was so small most people never had a chance to appreciate\nwhat a difference a good UX made\u2014software design on Windows tended to\nreflect how things worked internally. When the iPod came out, its\nfunctionality was the same as that of many other MP3 players, but its overall\nexperience, from putting music on to it to finding and playing the song you\nwant, was so great it crushed the competition. (Figure 6-2 shows the original\niPod\u2019s competition.) The iPhone kicked this into high gear with an incredibly\nintuitive touch experience. Even toddlers can use iOS. Apple\u2019s earnings\nreports show the result of this focus on user-centered design.", "Figure 6-2. The Creative Nomad Jukebox had a 6GB hard drive compared to the iPod\u2019s 5GB, but can\nyou guess how you\u2019d select a song? User experience matters!\nAs people used the iPod, the iPhone, and other products with a great user-\ncentered design, they came to appreciate how much easier the products were\nto use, letting them achieve their goals\u2014from listening to music to checking\ntheir voicemail\u2014faster. People began to want great experiences in all of\ntheir products, whether it was HR software or a thermostat. When faced with\ntwo products that solve a problem, they often picked the better-designed one.\nSlack, for example, has seen exponential growth by taking a product that\u2019s\nbeen around for years\u2014group chat\u2014and building a much better UX around\nit. This trend has led to far larger design teams and making design a full part\nof the product-development life cycle rather than an afterthought.\nBack in Chapter 2 when we discussed enterprise vs. consumer software,", "we mentioned that for a long time UX design mattered very little, in\nenterprise products especially. As long as the product solved a problem,\ncustomers would adapt and learn how to use it. But as people started to\nexperience well-designed UX in the consumer products they used at home,\nthey wanted better experiences at work. This had led to significant disruption\nin enterprise software lately, with new, well-designed tools like Basecamp\nreplacing big, traditional tools like Microsoft SharePoint.\nSo what goes into making a great, user-centered experience? At a high\nlevel, UX designers need to understand the customers, come up with ideas\nfor how to address their needs, help define requirements for the solution, and\ncreate a specification that they work with Engineering to build. This should\nsound similar to a product manager\u2019s role, and it absolutely is. In fact, this is\nwhy some start-ups won\u2019t hire a PM\u2014they feel a UX designer can do it all\u2014\nor conversely a start-up will want a PM to handle design tasks. However, the\ndifference is in the details, and while the roles are complementary, they\nreally do n eed different skills!<<<SECTION_BREAK>>>\nProduct Managers vs. Designers\nTo use an analogy, a PM is like the typical president of the United States and\nthe lead designer is like the typical secretary of state. This fits nicely with\nGuy Kawasaki\u2019s claim that a product manager has \u201call of the responsibility\nand none of the power.\u201d The president will set policy goals and provide\nreasons he picked those goals, but it\u2019s up to the secretary of state to work out\nthe details of achieving the goals. The secretary of state will also make\nrecommendations to the president to help him make good decisions and craft\nuseful goals. Essentially, the president focuses on strategy and not tactics,\nand the secretary of state is tactical. The president works with people beyond", "the secretary of state, too, be it the secretary of education or Congress\u2014he\nhas to keep a broad view every day! And while the secretary of state isn\u2019t\nresponsible for education, she should still have some knowledge of the\npresident\u2019s goals for the secretary of education\u2014she can\u2019t just work in a\nvacuum.\nThe product manager owns and writes the product requirements and goals.\nShe will lead the product requirements document (PRD), roadmap, cross-\nteam communication, and sometimes even the budget to help get the product\nbuilt. The lead designer will own the user-experience strategy: What UX do\nwe want to create, both short-term and long-term, to help deliver the best\noverall product experience? However, the lead designer will also likely do\nuser research and come up with requirements. Her research can help the PM\nfigure out what the final product requirements are, and design will also be\ntactical and determine how to meet those requirements. Like the typical\npresident, the PM will work frequently with every team, not just the lead\ndesigner, to shepherd the product, so the PM will have to balance everyone\u2019s\nneeds. And a good lead designer will have a basic understanding of the\nproduct\u2019s business context so that she\u2019s not working in a vacuum and can help\nthe product manager understand tradeoffs for different design decisions.<<<SECTION_BREAK>>>\nTHE DESIGN PROCESS AND KEY DESIGN SKILLS\nThe design process generally breaks dow n into six primary phases:\n1. User research\n2. Information architecture\n3. Interaction design\n4. Prototyping", "5. Visual design\n6. Content strategy\nEach phase requires a different dom inant skill. While some of these skills are\ncomplementary, you rarely find one person who\u2019s great at every part of the\ndesign process. That means you usually have a design team with different\npeople specialized in each tactical element, or some combination of\nelements.\nDuring each phase, you\u2019ll give feedback on the work the design team\ncreates, answer questions about the project\u2019s requirements and\ncustomer/business needs for the design team, facilitate any needed\ncommunication with the engineering lead and other stakeholders, and\nshepherd the process along. One way to help keep things moving is by having\na reoccurring Design/Engineering/Product meeting each week for the project,\nbut make it clear you\u2019re always available to answer questions the design\nteam has beyond those meetings.\nLet\u2019s look more at the typical design process and the types of designers\nyou\u2019ll encounter. The design process starts before you\u2019ve written the PRD, as\nyou work with the lead designer and a user researcher, if that\u2019s not the same\nperson, to figure out the right strategy and scope of your oppor tunity. Just like\na product manager, a user researcher is focused on understanding the\ncustomer, what his needs and goals are, what he\u2019s using now to address those\nneeds, and what we might do to make his life better. The lead designer and a\nuser researcher will often accompany you to customer interviews, and you\u2019ll\nwork together to figure out the user value you want to deliver, business goals\nto focus on, and the features/functionality you need to meet those goals and\ndeliver the value. They will likely have valuable input to your PRD, and as", "we mentioned in Chapter 5, take that input constructively.\nUser researchers also help with user testing. That is, later in the design\nprocess, once you\u2019ve built a prototype, user testing will help you learn how\nwell the customer accomplishes key tasks using your prototype.\nOnce you\u2019ve figured out what to build with a user researcher\u2019s help, an\ninformation architecture (IA) designer will figure out how to model and\norganize the data we\u2019re working with. IA is very much a structure step,\nasking what information a user should see first, second, and so on. IA might\ncreate a data model, explaining how the underlying product will conceptually\nbe presented to the customer, along with block diagrams expressing in what\norder to present the information. Figure 6-3 shows a sample IA diagram for\nMoove r\u2019s messaging feature.", "Interaction designers then take the information architecture and figure out\nhow to present it in the product. They\u2019re the ones who focus on how a\ncustomer navigates through the product, what UI controls you use (e.g.,\nshould you use a slider or a text field?), how many steps it takes to achieve\ncommon tasks, and more. As the skill implies, they\u2019re the ones really focused\non how you use the product. It\u2019s quite common to find designers who\nspecialize in IA and interaction design. This is also the step where the\nengineering lead will start to get involved, providing the design team with\nfeedback about the technical feasibility of its designs.\nThe most common delivery from this phase is a set of wireframes. These\nare rough, block diagrams showing how a user will interact with your", "product, like we see in Figure 6-4 for Moove r\u2014we\u2019re showing only one\nwireframe, but typically you\u2019ll have a series representing various views and\nkey interactions. Wireframes help you visualize where your customers will\nfind various pieces of information, how they will navigate through your\nproduct, and more. Wireframes are not interactive, and they might even be\nsketches on paper rather than digital assets.", "Design teams will often have prototyping experts who turn these static\nwireframes into interactive prototypes using anything from HTML to\nspecialized tools like Balsamiq and InVision. Prototypes are incredibly\nhelpful for three reasons. First, they help everyone working on the product\ninternally to understand what you\u2019re building, be it people on the direct team,\nyour boss, or beyond. Having something visual is more easily understandable\nthan a written PRD, and having something interactive is even better. Second,\nthe prototype helps Engineering provide more accurate estimates for how\nhard parts of the product will be to build. Using a standard UI control might\ntake minutes to implement whereas a custom control the design team created\nmight take days, for example, and all the teams will have to discuss if the", "custom control is worth the time tradeoff. That decision will then affect the\nprototype. Third, prototypes help with usability testing.\nAfter prototyping, you will have a great idea of how the product will\nwork/flow, but you won\u2019t know what it will look like. Visual design is the\nfocus on how the product will look. Your team\u2019s visual designers will often\nwork in parallel with the people creating wireframes, establishing the\noverall look and feel of your product. They will create mock-ups, like Figure\n6-5, usually based on the wireframes, that look pixel-perfect but aren\u2019t\nfunctional. These mock-ups are designed to help the product\u2019s overall team\ngauge how everything will come together, and the end product will visually\nlook similar to the mock-up.\nVisual design is more than just making the app look pretty, though. Visual\ndesigners need to consider usability (e.g., is the font large enough to read and\nare the buttons large enough to tap accurately on a phone?), emotions\n(conveyed through colors and icons), and consistent brand messaging. Visual\ndesigners will often work with marketing to create a company style guide that\ninfluences everything from customer announcement emails to the marketing\nwebsite to the actual product.\nSometimes visual designers and prototypers will create a higher-fidelity\nprototype using the mock-up and wireframes, giving the prototype a more\nfinished feel to help you judge the product more effectively.\nAfter you\u2019ve created your wireframes and mock-ups for Engineering to\nimplement, a content strategist will help make sure your product is using the\nright media and text, such as how to word an alert. Like visual design,\ncontent strategy applies to marketing, too, and you want to use consistent\nwords and have a consistent tone. It detracts from the overall experience and\ncan confuse your customers because of misaligned expectations if your app is", "very formal and your website is very whimsical. Some companies will have\none copy manager who is responsible for all text, be it in-product or in an ad.\nThe main design process is done when your prototypes and mock-ups are\nvalidated as a solution and Engineering has agreed to their viability. As you\nhand the designs over to Engineering, you will likely discover questions\nabout how part of the product should behave, unanticipated edge cases that\nneed to be designed, new alerts you need the proper wording for, and parts of\nthe design that are problematic to implement.\nYour primary role throughout this process will be facilitator, but you\u2019ll also\nwant to make sure early test customers are happy with the designs and able to\nachieve the product goal satisfactorily. You\u2019ll likely want to keep running a\nmeeting with the design and engineering teams throughout the project to make\nsure everyone is on the same page and to address early user feedback and\nadditional engineering needs. For example, if you have a ship-date deadline,\nyou might need to cut a feature and change part of the product\u2019s design so that\nthe feature doesn\u2019t appear to be missing. The entire design process isn\u2019t truly\ndone until the product ships.<<<SECTION_BREAK>>>\nUsability Testing with Prototypes\nAs your design team builds a design, it\u2019s useful to test various aspects of it\nwith customers when possible to see if the design is easy and pleasant to use\nand ensure that your customer can complete tasks the tester gives them with\nthe design.\nUser researchers and prototypers will work together to perform this testing.\nTools like UserTesting (which lets you get videos of random people that meet\nspecified criteria performing tasks with your website, mobile apps, or\nprototype), and UsabilityHub (which provides data, including heat maps,", "about how people perform tasks with your static mock-ups across different\ncategories) help simplify the task.\nUsability testing is critical to making a successful user-centered design, but\nit isn\u2019t perfect. It doesn\u2019t test for questions like \u201cIs this product valuable to a\ncustomer?\u201d The hypothesis validation you did in Chapter 4 should have\nanswered that type of question. If you\u2019re testing a new feature in isolation\nfrom the main product with a prototype, usability testing won\u2019t test whether\nexisting customers are able to find and use this new feature. It also can\u2019t\naccount for things like taste. A test might reveal that customers are most\nsuccessful when you use an orange-and-green color scheme for the feature,\nbut unless you\u2019re building a pumpkin-themed product, you might choose to\ntrade some usability value for a better aesthetic.\nOnce in a while, even a user-centered design team has to make choices that\nseem more like they force the customer to adapt to the product rather than\nbeing user-centered. Sometimes this is due to an internal limitation, such as\nengineering or design resources. Other times it\u2019s because this choice is in\nline with the company\u2019s vision and general attitude, such as Apple\u2019s not\nproviding removable storage on the iPhone. A great design team will also\nthink about the future and the roadmap, and this might lead to making choices\nin the current product that seem weird but are better for the future, like\nremoving the floppy  drive and serial ports from the original iMac. While\ntesting is important, design is often more of an art than a science.\nHowever, this doesn\u2019t mean you should ship an unusable design because it\u2019s\nin line with your company vision! If a customer can\u2019t use your product to\nsolve his problem, or if it\u2019s very hard to use your product, he\u2019ll look for a\ndifferent solution. Your product must be usable in addition to providing\nutility!", "Just like how you created an oppor tunity hypothesis and then worked to\nvalidate it, design will create various UX possibilities and then work to\nconverge on the main design. Just like your oppor tunity hypothesis, bigger\nideas will need more work to validate. Some small projects might not\nrequire any design iteration. If you\u2019re responsible for the schedule, make sure\nto incorporate the appropriate time for design to iterate.<<<SECTION_BREAK>>>\nWORKING WITH DESIGN\nWhile product and design will often have a fantastic relationship, all too\noften they have a frustrating relationship. Let\u2019s dig into why that happens and\nlook at some tips to help you work well with your design team.\nJudging and Giving Feedback About Design\nAs a PM, you will be expected to give feedback about designs and to have\ninformed opinions. While we highly recommend you take the time to learn\nabout design, reading book s like Donald Norman\u2019s seminal The Design of\nEveryday Things, it is possible to have an educated opinion about design\nwithout being an expert. We can form that opinion by using a framework with\nspecific criteria and then looking at how the design meets those elements.\nThe most important criteria we\u2019re going to set is \u201cDoes this design let the\ncustomer achieve his goal with the least friction possible?\u201d As you look at a\nwireframe and imagine using the product step by step or as you actually try a\nprototype, are you able to accomplish the key tasks the product promises?\nDoes the design ask for irrelevant information or require complex actions\nthat prevent you from achieving your goals?\nAsk yourself this question for every use case, and you\u2019ll be amazed what\nyou find. On some cameras, for example, it\u2019s easy to put the battery in", "backwards because the battery\u2019s a rectangle with no special groove s. The\nonly indication that you\u2019ve put it in wrong is when the camera doesn\u2019t turn\non. A design change might have spared users the hassle of putting their\nbatteries in wrong!\nWith software, is the information users need easily at hand, or are they\nconstantly having to bounce between parts of the app to get the needed data?\nWhat about the sign-up process\u2014do you have a simple one that lets users\nimmediately engage with the app, or do you ask a lot of irrelevant questions\nbefore they can start using it?\nTo go a step further in our criteria, we\u2019re going to recommend using Dieter\nRams\u2019s 10 principles of \u201cgood design.\u201d Rams is a well-known designer,\nprimarily having worked at Braun throughout his career. His designs are\nhighly regarded, he\u2019s influenced numerous designers, including Jony Ive, and\nhis 10 pr inciples are easy to understand.\nGood design is innovative. Technological innovation is constantly creating\noppor tunities for new and innovative designs. This doesn\u2019t mean that you\nneed to reinvent the wheel with every design. Often, there are standard\ndesign elements that will make sense for your product, like a button. But\nespecially when you\u2019re building an innovative product, it\u2019s worth asking if\nyou\u2019re being innovative with your design or applying old design ideas to\nsomething new.\nGood design makes a product useful. We want our products to be used\nand loved, which means they need to be useful. The design has to make the\nproduct functional but also psychologically pleasing. Dental headgear is a\ngreat example of a functional product that\u2019s not psychologically pleasing,", "which means a customer won\u2019t want to use it.\nGood design is aesthetic. Quoting Rams, \u201cThe aesthetic quality of a\nproduct is integral to its usefulness because products are used every day\nand have an effect on people and their well-being. Only well-executed\nobjects can be beautiful.\u201d\nGood design makes a product understandable. Design can help make a\nproduct\u2019s intended function clear, and great design makes the product usable\nwithout any training. When it fails to make the product understandable, the\ncustomer often gets frustrated trying to use the product or remembering how\nto use it.\nGood design is unobtrusive. Products exist to help a customer be awesome\nand achieve a goal, not to be revered by themselves. If a design is neutral\nand restrained, it lets the focus be on the customer rather than calling\nattention to itself.\nGood design is honest. A well-designed product doesn\u2019t make the\ncustomer believe it does something that it doesn\u2019t actually do or that it is\nsomething more valuable than it actually is. Painting the product gold won\u2019t\nmake it actually be as valuable as if it were made out of gold.\nGood design is long-lasting. While it can be tempting to make something\ntrendy and fashionable, good design will last so that even as styles change,\nyour product won\u2019t go the way of the mullet.\nGood design is thorough down to the last detail. You want to think out\nevery aspect so you make sure that no matter how customers interact with", "your product, they\u2019re encountering a great experience.\nGood design is environmentally friendly. Design can help us preserve our\nplanet for future generations by minimizing the resources it needs, whether\nwe\u2019re talking about compute cycles that require power or physical design\nthat needs raw materials.\nGood design is as little design as possible. As Rams puts it, \u201cless, but\nbetter.\u201d As you evaluate a design, ask yourself if you can eliminate\nelements. Focus on reducing the design to its essentials, as that purity and\nsimplicity will help make your products aesthetic, understandable,\nunobtrusive, and honest.\nNot every principle will apply to every design with equal weight. When\nyou\u2019re building an app, you likely don\u2019t care as much about its long-lasting\nor environmentally friendly nature. But when a designer gives you a\nwireframe, prototype, or mock-up and asks what you think, these criteria give\nyou a way to provide thoughtful and precise feedback.<<<SECTION_BREAK>>>\nDesign Relationship Skills\nThe biggest source of conflict is that both product and design feel like they\nrepresent the customer. Both groups do represent the customer, just in\ndifferent ways. Like we said earlier, PMs have to think about the big picture\nand about different teams\u2019 needs, whereas the design lead will be more\ntactical and focused primarily on a great design. A handy way to think about\nthe difference is that product managers focus on the ideal customer, whereas\nlead designers often focus on the ideal user.\nLet\u2019s look at an example to understand the difference. If you were designing", "a keyboard, your goal would be to help users type quickly and accurately.\nThe design team would come up with a fantastic keyboard layout, and it\nalmost certainly wouldn\u2019t be the most common keyboard layout, QWERTY.\nQWERTY has been proven to not be the ideal design for fast or accurate\ntyping.\nBut QWERTY keyboards have been around for a long time. They\u2019re\neverywhere, from your computer to your smartphone to some TV remotes!\nCustomers know how to type on them relatively quickly and accurately. A\nnon-QWERTY keyboard will have a potentially steep learning curve,\nmeaning customers won\u2019t type quickly or accurately while they learn the new\nlayout.\nWhile our design team could come up with a new keyboard layout for the\nideal user whose goal is to type quickly and accurately, the ideal customer\nmost likely wouldn\u2019t buy it because of the short-term tradeoff.\nTo understand customers comprehensively, it\u2019s useful to focus on their\npersonas. In addition to their goals, what other factors are at play that will\naffect the customers\u2019 behavior? In our keyboard example, while their goal\nwas to type quickly and accurately, their prior familiarity with QWERTY is a\nbig factor that affects our product choices.\nSometimes, especially with consumer products, it\u2019s easy for PMs to believe\nthey represent the target persona accurately, even when they don\u2019t. These\nPMs often ignore the details of the persona, using their own taste, not persona\ndetails, to make product decisions. This can be frustrating to designers, as\nthis can make the PM\u2019s decisions feel arbitrary.\nMicromanaging every decision design can cause friction between the design\nteam and the PM, too. PMs are ultimately responsible for the success or\nfailure of the product, and that responsibility can cause them to try to tell the", "design team how to design the product. We mentioned earlier that\nwireframes, mock-ups, and prototypes are great because they\u2019re so much\nmore immediately comprehensible than the PRD. The flip side is that\nbecause design is so visible, it\u2019s easy to have an uninformed opinion. Trust\nyour design team to make smart decisions, and use criteria like Rams\u2019s\ndesign principles to assess if they\u2019re good decisions and to give informed\nopinions.\nSo how do you build a constructive relationship with the design team? A\nsimple but important step is to get to know the team. Building individual\nrelationships with the people you work with will help you respect each other\nas people and deal with conflict more productively.\nBeyond that, in no particular order, there\u2019s a variety of things you can do to\nhave a great relationship with your design team. We recommend that you\nlearn a bit about design, if you don\u2019t know about it already. You don\u2019t need to\nbe an expert, but you should be able to talk about why you think a product is\nwell-designed or not. For software, learn common design patterns and\naccepted layouts for functions like search, settings, and more, especially for\ndifferent platforms. This will help you learn not to force an Android app to\nlook just like an iOS app or  vice versa, for example.\nAs you learn about design, focus on developing an appreciation for what\ngoes into design so that when you see a wireframe, you can ask good\nquestions about why the designers made certain choices and understand the\nimplication of those choices rather than arbitrarily telling them to do certain\nthings. Words like \u201cwhite space\u201d and \u201chierarchy\u201d should eventually be part\nof your vocabulary.\nSimilarly, don\u2019t overstep your bounds. In the PRD, do not specify the\ndesign. Your job is to give requirements and constraints along with how", "you\u2019ll consider the problem solved, and let Design and Engineering find the\nsolution. For example, rather than incorporating mock-ups of a new\nonboarding process, specify what data is required and what\u2019s optional for a\nuser to enter, then let design create a wireframe showing how to enter that\ndata. Even if you used to be an amazing designer, your primary job as a PM\nis to focus on giving clear personas, requirements, and goals.\nYour design team will love you if you\u2019re clear on those three elements. This\nclarity will be part of a well-written PRD and true at the highest level\u2014the\noverall project objective\u2014and with individual user stories. Rather than just\nsaying, \u201cWe need to improve the onboarding process,\u201d explicitly say who the\ntarget customers are, what you need the onboarding process to achieve, and\nhow you measure its success.\nFurthermore, never, ever vaguely say a product is for \u201ceveryone.\u201d There is\nno such persona, and no product is perfect for every single person. Instead,\nmake sure your target market is a clear part of the requirements in the PRD\nand that a persona is defined so that design can make the right choices to\naddress that persona\u2019s needs.\nOnce in a while, you\u2019ll find that you really, really want to sketch out a UX,\nas it\u2019ll be the fastest way to share your thoughts, be it in early conversations\nabout the product or even in a PRD. When you first join a new team, you\u2019ll\nneed to work with other stakeholders and earn their respect. We recommend\nputting together a whiteboarding session with the design lead (and maybe the\nengineering lead) to discuss initial, rough ideas. Together, you can draw on a\nwhiteboard and then take photos of the board to incorporate into your PRD or\nshare with others.\nAfter you\u2019ve worked with a team, you\u2019ll usually find it\u2019s OK to sketch out a\nUX concept on your own rather than only including photos of whiteboards,", "but you need to recognize and make clear to others that this sketch is just to\nconvey what you mean, not to imply design answers. The best way to do this\nis via a napk in sketch. A napkin sketch is a drawing that\u2019s low quality and\ncreated quickly, as if you drew on the back of a napkin with a pen. We\nrecommend using a tool like FiftyThree\u2019s Paper for the iPad instead of a\nprototyping tool like InVision or Balsamiq for any UX sketches you create.\nThis will make sure your sketch is clearly hand-drawn and force you to\ncreate something unpolished but give you a digital drawing with a nice stroke\nquality.\nAs the design team starts to ideate using your PRD, work with them and\nother stakeholders to discuss the pros and cons of each idea beyond just if\nit\u2019s a good design or not, especially thinking about the ideal user vs.\ncustomer. Furthermore, ask if the team\u2019s thought through all the implications\nof the design. If you\u2019re designing a social network and the design team has a\nflag button in the design to mark inappropriate content, what happens when a\ncustomer presses that button? Does that button mean someone on the support\nteam will manually have to look at the content and possibly remove it? Does\nthat team have resources to do s o?\nAll of this advice rolls up into one key point: your job is to provide clear\ncommunication between all stakeholders while keeping the end goal\u2014\nmaking the customer awesome\u2014in everyone\u2019s mind. You are not here to do\nthe stakeholder\u2019s work\u2014you left Design/Engineering/Support/etc. behind to\nmove into product management. You need to keep everyone moving towards\nyour goal.\nThere\u2019s a great story about when President Kennedy visited NASA in 1962.\nThe president asked a janitor what he was doing, and the janitor replied,\n\u201cWell, Mr. President, I\u2019m helping put a man on the moon.\u201d NASA did a great", "job making sure everyone knew what they were working towards, and that\nhelped every individual think about how his actions affected that goal. You\nmight feel like a broken record sometimes, but if you focus on keeping your\nproduct\u2019s goal front and center in everyone\u2019s mind, you\u2019ll be amazed at how\nthe whole team rises to deliver on that goal.<<<SECTION_BREAK>>>\nGOOGLE DESIGN SPRINTS\nGoogle Ventures came up with a great way to use design thinking to solve\ncritical business questions. It has used this process with its portfolio\ncompanies to solve problems ranging from \u201cIs our new business viable?\u201d to\n\u201cHow do we develop this new feature for existing products with millions of\nusers?\u201d\nWe like design sprints because they\u2019re collaborative (involving key\nstakeholders from each department), focused, effective, and user-centered\nways to solve big problems. Furthermore, as we\u2019ve just spent a long time\nexplaining, PMs often have to be hands-off with the actual design work, but\nin a design sprint you get to be hands-on. This can be fun, letting you use your\ncreativity, and it will help you gain an appreciation for what your design\nteam does day to day.\nThese sprints typically last a week. You start the week with a specific\nchallenge to solve, and you end the week with a design the team\u2019s agreed\nupon and that you\u2019ve validated with real customers. Of course, once in a\nwhile you end up invalidating the design and/or raising new questions, but\nthen you can run another sprint using what you learned. Let\u2019s dive into how to\nrun a design sprint!\nSprint Preparation", "Start by picking a sprint master. This person will set the context for the\ndesign sprint and facilitate each stage of the sprint. This will usually be\nsomeone who is familiar with UX research and interaction design, but this\nperson should also be able to lead a meeting productively and get every\nparticipant contributing. The sprint master will do a fair bit of planning\naround content and logistics before the sprint to make sure it runs smoothly.\nGoogle recommends about one day of preparation for each day of the sprint.\nFor content planning, the sprint master will write a design brief that clearly\ndefines the challenge (the PRD can be a great reference here), the\ndeliverable, and the timeline to launch. She might also do a design audit\nbeforehand, pulling together the current designs, user research, and more, to\nprovide context to the sprint team. This is especially critical if the team has\nalready done work on this problem, as there will be existing learning you can\nbuild from.\nFor the sprint logistics, she\u2019ll start by determining the right team to have on\nthe sprint. The best teams are five to eight people and include the PM,\ndesigners, engineers, and other experts or stakeholders. Sometimes,\nespecially in start-ups, the CEO will be part of the sprint team. It\u2019s also\npossible to have multiple teams working in parallel on the same challenge.\nThe sprint master will even schedule the room and make sure she has all the\nneeded supplies, including paper, tape, sticky notes, voting stickers, a timer,\nand pens.\nUnderstand\nThe first part of the sprint is devoted to understanding the problem you\u2019re\ntrying to solve, why you\u2019re trying to solve it, who the customers are, those\ncustomers\u2019 needs and capabilities, and more. As we discussed in Chapter 2,", "understanding the overall context for your customers and company/product is\nalways the first step towards creating new solutions.\nThe sprint master might arrange short talks, user interviews, field visits to\ncustomers, competitive overviews, or beyond to facilitate this step. If you\u2019ve\ndone previous research or work with this sprint challenge, this step is when\nyou\u2019ll present that previous work.\nYou as the product manager will likely play a key role here in helping the\nrest of the team understand your goals and strategy.\nDuring the first day of the sprint, you\u2019ll also schedule your customer-testing\ninterviews for the last day. This will put pressure on your team, forcing you\nto create something to show customers, given real people are coming to see\nyour work. After all, the best creativity happens when you have constraints!\nDefine\nAfter the team understands the problem space, come up with a clear problem\ndefinition. This is when you narrow the problem and come up with the key\nprinciples and goals to help you measure your solution. You might define\nyour design objectives, such as building a \u201cfun to use\u201d product, or you might\nthink about the messaging and tag line for your solution, like \u201ca thousand\nsongs in your pocket.\u201d\nDiverge\nAfter you clearly know the problem and what you want your solution to\nachieve, you and the sprint team will brainstorm as many ideas as possible\nfor how to solve the sprint challenge. You might have everyone work\nindividually to generate ideas using \u201cCrazy Eights,\u201d where you fold a piece\nof paper in half three times, to create a page with eight segments, and take", "five minutes to draw eight ideas, one per segment.\nOr perhaps you\u2019ll work together to brainstorm ideas. Make sure not to\nreject anyone\u2019s ideas during this phase\u2014your goal is to generate as many\nideas as possible, even bad ones. In fact, sometimes working together to\ncome up with the worst possible solution can help you think of new ideas for\nthe best solution.\nYou don\u2019t need to be able to draw well to participate in the Diverge phase.\nBut you should make sure anything you draw or create is understandable on\nits own, without an explanation from the creator. It\u2019s OK to put some text on\nyour drawings or to use multiple drawings to show a flow. Give the concepts\ntitles to help you refer to them. However, don\u2019t put the creator\u2019s name on\neach. You don\u2019t want any company politics to influence which ideas you\npick.\nGet crazy, get creative, and don \u2019t filter yourself. Ideate, ideate, ideate.\nDecide\nOnce you\u2019ve come up with a lot of ideas, you\u2019ll pick the best ones, so far, by\nvoting.\nFor the first round of voting, everyone gets an unlimited number of voting\nstickers, and you vote on what ideas, or pieces of ideas, you like the best.\nYou can use lots of stickers if you love something.\nEven though each idea should be self-explanatory, spend some time\ndiscussing each one. For example, take three minutes to look at each idea,\nand discuss what you like about it, what you don\u2019t like, what could go wrong,\nand more. Don\u2019t let the creator explain the idea first, as it should stand on its\nown, but if the others miss an aspect of the idea, the creator can point it out.\nDon\u2019t worry about achieving consensus during this first round\u2014talk about", "what you like with the various ideas.\nAfter you\u2019ve discussed each idea, you\u2019ll super-vote. This is the decision-\nmaking vote. Each team member will get a limited number of voting stickers,\nand the CEO and PM will get extra voting stickers. Again put these stickers\nnext to what you believe is the best idea, or part of an idea. This voting\nprocess will help you uncover the best ideas, regardless of who created\nthem.\nPrototype\nAfter picking a key idea or two, create a prototype. Building this prototype\nwill take the most time of all the steps, but you will emerge with a mock-up,\ndemo, ph ysical prototype, or other way of demonstrating the idea that you can\nshow to real people.\nYou might end up having multiple prototypes to test the overall utility of the\nsolution separate from the usability or to test the usability of different ideas.\nThe key in this step is to make some artifact that will help you validate your\nsolution. After all, you\u2019ll be showing it to customers shortly!\nUser Testing\nThe final step in the sprint is showing your prototype to real customers and\ngetting feedback. Try to find out what they like and dislike, if the solution\nwill meet their needs, and if there are hidden factors that could stop them\nfrom using this solution.\nYou can also ask for feedback to measure how well you achieved the goals\nyou set forth in the Define step. For example, ask each user to rate how much\nfun they had using your product and what made it less fun.\nMake sure to validate this solution with the key stakeholders, including the", "engineering team, too, to confirm that this is the solution everyone is onboard\nwith pursuing and believes can be implemented.\nWhen user testing is finished and the sprint is over, take some time to\nreview the process and analyze how it went. Did these customers like the\nsolution, or did the design not work? Do you need to do another sprint?\nIdeally, you\u2019ll have a basic design that you know has promise, which you can\ntake, flesh out, and turn into a real product.\nIf you like this approach and want to run your own sprints, we highly\nrecommend reading Google Ventures\u2019s book  Sprint: How to Solve Big\nProblems and Test New Ideas in Just Five Days. This book  contains lots of\ntips from Google Ventures\u2019s experience running sprints, to help you run the\nbest sprint possible.\nAt this point, you should have an appreciation for what design involves and\nsee that it\u2019s more than just making things look pretty. You should also have an\nidea about how to work collaboratively with the design team. Remember, we\nsay that design is done when our prototypes and mock-ups are validated as a\nsolution to the problem we\u2019re trying to solve and Engineering has agreed to\nthe designs\u2019 viability. Now that we\u2019ve drawn up the blueprints for our\nproduct, let\u2019s turn our attention to how we\u2019ll work with Engineering to get\nour product built.<<<SECTION_BREAK>>>\n________ \nCHAPTER SIX TIP", "Conrad Albrecht-Buehler, an amazing designer who\u2019s also worked as a\nproduc t manage r, provides us with this chapter\u2019s tip. Conrad has designed\nan award-winning in-car interface for BMW, designed some of the first\nmobile applications for VMware, and worked on several produc ts at Apple.\nIn addition to being a designer, he has worked as a software engineer, a\nproduc t manage r, and a user researcher. He lives in Munich and the Bay\nArea with his wife, two kids, and a Shi ba Inu.\nBEING OPEN AND FLEXIBLE\nAaron Sorkin, who\u2019s written some of my favorite television and films, recently said that for many\nepisodes of The West Wing, he would start with just an idea for a moment, and then let the story build as\nhe wrote it. To paraphrase: he didn\u2019t always know exactly what he was writing until he wrote it. In\ninterviews, many of my favorite authors and, yes, even designers, have said the same thing. It\u2019s not\nbecause they lacked discipline or were not methodical in their work, but stories and products are\ncomplex, and, until you get deep into creating either one, much of that complexity isn\u2019t\nrevealed. Because of that, as a PM working with a designer\u2014be it a user-experience designer, user\nresearcher, or industrial or visual designer\u2014my advice is this: be open and be flexible.\nAs a designer works to accommodate requirements from product and from engineering (and myriad\nother sources described in previous chapters), compromises must be made on one aspect or another. Be\nflexible, rather than authoritarian. Don\u2019t try to push a singular agenda an call it a \u201cvision.\u201d Be open to\ncompromise as the deeper complexities of the product reveal themselves. The best designers learn how\nto make the best compromises. But not without your help and the help of all stakeholders and\ncontributors. However, as the PM, you may have to referee the debate around these compromises, and\nthat\u2019s always tough because you will never be a neutral observer in those debates.\nThe various sides of the debate will be framed in terms of cost vs. benefit. Most stakeholders will see\nthe costs in terms of financial costs or time costs\u2014things that impact the company and employees. The\ndesigners will see the costs in terms of impact to the user. That is where things go off the rails most\nfrequently. Another stakeholder will claim, \u201cI\u2019m a user, and I\u2019d be fine with this.\u201d Maybe the customer\nwill be, as well, but it is the responsibility of the designer to know how people who are not just like the\ndesigner will perceive and interpret the product. Even if all the debate participants claim that they, as", "users, would also be fine with a compromise, don\u2019t treat that as a majority of a sample size and imagine\nthat the designer arguing for something else is obviously mistaken. Be open to their experience, and\nvalue the time they\u2019ve spent trying to get into the heads of people different from themselves to help you\npredict how a customer will see, use, and value your product. It may help you make the best, if not\nalways the most expedient, compromise as you address the complexities of a product.<<<SECTION_BREAK>>>", "Now that you\u2019ve figured out your product\u2019s requirements and come up with\n\u2014and hopefully tested\u2014a  design, it\u2019s time to actually build your product! In\npractice, this phase of the product-development life cycle is where you will\nspend the bulk of your time as a product manager. You\u2019ll work closely with\nEngineering day to day to help oversee the product that\u2019s being built, making\nsure it meets the product requirements, making scope changes if key features\nare taking longer than expect to develop, prioritizing the backlog, and\neliminating whatever obstacles you can for the engineering team.\nYou\u2019ll want to do your best to establish a strong relationship with the\nengineering team because although a great relationship doesn\u2019t guarantee", "success, a bad relationship guarantees failure.\nWhile this phase can be a lot of fun as the product comes to life, it can be\nvery hard for product managers for two reasons. The first is that if you\nstarted your career as an engineer, you might unintentionally frustrate the\nengineering team or imply you know better than they do. Alternatively, if you\ndon\u2019t have an engineering background, you might not understand how\nengineers work\u2014or how to work with them\u2014causing them to not respect\nyou. Fortunately, these problems are avoidable! Let\u2019s start by looking at soft\nskills, interpersonal relationship skills that will help you work with\nengineering. Then we\u2019ll look at common ways engineering teams work and\nsee how you as the PM fit into those workflows.<<<SECTION_BREAK>>>\nPRODUCT/ENGINEERING RELATIONSHIPS\nJust as design is more than just creating pixels, engineering is more than just\ntyping code. Programming is very much like an art form: you\u2019re building\nsomething from nothing, and all of the pieces must function pretty much\nperfectly or the whole product won\u2019t work. This artistic complexity leads to\nsome common traits in engineers worth knowing about, as understanding\nthese traits will help your interpersonal communication and relationship with\nengineers.\nIn general, engineers are highly intelligent people motivated by working on\nhard problems and learning something new. They\u2019re often very independent\nand care more about crafting an elegant solution to a complex problem than\nabout specific business needs. Engineering is hard, and every product needs\nengineers. Given that, their skills are incredibly in demand and talented\nengineers are worth their weight in gold!\nHowever, because their skills are in demand, if engineers feel like they\u2019re", "not being respected or mentally challenged, or if they don\u2019t believe in the\noverall product and direction, they\u2019ll likely look for a new oppor tunity.\nReplacing an engineer is very costly, both in terms of actual cost and\nproductivity costs. PMs can help engineers, and the whole company, by\nmaking sure engineers feel respected and recognized and have confidence in\nthe product.\nSo how do you keep a great relationship with Engineering? You\u2019re starting\noff the right way by recognizing that it takes work! The biggest thing you\nshould keep in mind is that coding is hard and you should trust that your\nengineers know their craft\u2014contrary to what some designers and PMs think,\nengineers are not just code monkeys typing on keyboards. Especially if you\nhave an engineering background, one of the worst things to say to an engineer\nis \u201ccan\u2019t you just\u2026.\u201d Those three words imply that whatever the engineer is\ndoing is easy and that you know better.\nWe recommend that you view working with Engineering as an educational\nexperience, both for you and for them. For example, ask them to help estimate\nhow hard a task might be. And if the estimate is higher than expected, ask if\nthey could explain what goes into that estimate and where the tricky parts are.\nThis will help you understand the full scope of the task, and if the engineer is\nmaking assumptions because you hadn\u2019t accounted for something, perhaps\nyou can decide to limit the scope of the task and make the engineer\u2019s life\neasier. As a simple example, if you\u2019re building a streaming-video player, it\ntakes a lot more work to make a 4K video stream efficiently than a normal\nHD one. If it makes sense, you could make a product choice to not support\nstreaming 4K content, thereby reducing Engineering\u2019s workload.\nAnother big mistake that PMs make with Engineering is that they don\u2019t take\ntime to get to know the engineers and how to best work with each person.", "Some engineers work best when they have a to-do list, and they don\u2019t care\nabout the broader picture or why you\u2019re making certain choices. But other\nengineers get frustrated when you don\u2019t clearly explain why you made certain\nchoices. To those engineers, this makes you come across as dictating, not\ncollaborating. A well-written product requirements document (PRD) like we\ndescribed in Chapter 5 can help both of these situations, as it makes the\ninformation available for the engineers should they choose to read it.\nAs you continue throughout the development cycle and have to make hard\ndecisions, cut features, etc., make sure to work with the engineering lead and\nperhaps individual engineers to understand the technical side of these\ndecisions. They\u2019re the only people who can tell you how technically feasible\nsomething is and provide an estimate for how difficult it will be to build.\nThis doesn\u2019t always mean Engineering just has bad news for PMs.\nSometimes they\u2019ll even tell you that something you thought impossible is\nactually feasible! Do make sure to write down key decisions, such as in the\nPRD or in key user stories\u2014or in epic requirements if you\u2019re using scrum\u2014\nso that there\u2019s no confusion about what the state of that decision is.\nFurthermore, change and tradeoffs happen in every product. Projects often\nget behind schedule because many small things pile up, such as someone\nbeing out sick for a while, family emergencies, jury duty, and more. If you\nwork closely with Engineering to watch the balance between time (When are\nwe aiming to have this done/shipped?), quality (Can we take on some\ntechnical debt now?), and money (Would more people or overtime help us\nget this project done?), you\u2019ll keep the process collaborative and deliver the\nhighest-possible-quality product on the best-possible schedule.\nWorking on projects that have a lot of technical debt can also be very\nfrustrating for engineers, as accumulated debt can make even polish and bug", "fixes painful. We\u2019ve talked before about how it\u2019s important to the project\u2019s\noverall momentum to periodically pay off any technical debt. It\u2019s also\nimportant to your engineers\u2019 sanity and your relationship with them to\nperiodically do s o.\nA lot going on in an office inherently conspires against engineers.\nSpecifically, solving hard problems requires deep concentration.\nInterruptions, whether for meetings or to reply to high-priority messages via\nemail, Slack, HipChat, etc., can be very frustrating and tough to recover from\nmentally. Open office plans make things even worse, as there are so many\ndistractions and so much noise that developers often wear large, noise-\ncancelling headphones so that they can focus on their work.\nWhile some of this is beyond your control, like floor plans, there are some\nthings you can control, especially around communication. Do what you can to\ngive the engineering team time to focus on getting its work done, even if it\nmeans you have to wait for an answer to a question. Not every question you\nhave is urgent, and interrupting someone\u2019s coding flow for a non-critical\nquestion is never appreciated.\nAs Engineering completes each task, make sure to provide feedback,\nwhether it\u2019s that they did a great job and exceeded your expectations or that\nyou found a bug or something isn\u2019t quite right. And when the project\u2019s over,\nmake sure the engineers\u2014and everyone else involved\u2014g et their share of the\ncredit for getting the project done. Don\u2019t hog the credit\u2014be  humble!\nTo be clear, the engineering team is not the PM\u2019s boss\u2014you don\u2019t need the\nengineers\u2019 approval on everything, and they\u2019re not the most important people\nin the company. But they\u2019re the ones building the product and the ones you\u2019ll\nspend a lot of your time with. If you put in the extra effort to do your best for\nthem and to help them feel like part of the overall project team and not just", "code monkeys, they\u2019ll feel happier and more respected, and the work they do\nwill be higher quality.\nFinally, no two engineering teams are the same. While you should keep our\nadvice in mind on the whole, sometimes with junior teams you need to step in\na little more and make sure they\u2019re following best practices. For example,\nyou might need to explicitly encourage them to add more automated test\ncoverage and to take time to do t horough code reviews.<<<SECTION_BREAK>>>\nSOFTWARE-DEVELOPMENT METHODOLOGIES\nA development methodology is simply the framework you use to structure the\nwork to build the product. These methodologies are really more about\nproject management, not just how developers write code. We\u2019ve touched on\ntwo of these methodologies\u2014waterfall and lean/agile\u2014 previously, but they\nhave such a profound impact on how your engineering team works, we\u2019ll\ncover them in detail here. We\u2019re going to focus on various software-\ndevelopment methodologies, but many of the same principles apply to\nhardware development.\nAt one end of the spectrum, you have workflows where you, the PM, create\na detailed spec and the engineering team disappears for months\u2014likely more\nthan you anticipated\u2014reemerging with the product built exactly as specified.\nAt the other end, the engineering team divides the project into the smallest\ntasks possible, programmers work in pairs on the same computer to complete\none task, and then they come back to see what task they should do next. The\nnext-up tasks might change while the programmers are working on their\ncurrent task, and it doesn\u2019t matter to the programmers. Let\u2019s compare the two\nmost common approaches along this spectrum, waterfall and agile.", "<<<SECTION_BREAK>>>Waterfall Development\nThe waterfall method is the oldest style of software development. Early\nsoftware engineers simply adopted stages from the hardware world\n(manufacturing), and over time this approach became more refined. In 1985,\nthe US Department of Defense formalized the waterfall process in its DOD-\nSTD-2167A  document, which specified that its contractors would use this\napproach to write software along with detailed descriptions of how they\u2019d\nuse it and the deliverables they\u2019d create.\nAs you might guess, the waterfall method is very structured, with explicit,\nformal stages. It\u2019s even called \u201cwaterfall\u201d because you can\u2019t move to the next\nstage until the current stage is done\u2014everything goes from one stage to the\nnext in a big dump, like water over a waterfall. Waterfall development starts\nwith the requirements phase, where the PM has the most to do, finding the\nright opportunity and writing a very detailed PRD. Unlike the PRDs we\ndiscussed in Chapter 5, waterfall PRDs need to be detailed and complete,\nspecifying as much of the project up front as possible. They are not living\ndocuments, but rather large and detailed bibles for the product.\nAfter the requirements phase, Engineering and Design take over, beginning\nwith a design phase, a coding phase, and a testing and integration phase.\nProducts often ship with known bugs, as they\u2019d never release if you fixed\nevery bug. PMs are often involved in prioritizing bugs to make sure the ones\nthat will affect customers the most are fixed before release.\nWaterfall has a few benefits. For one, everyone will have a great idea of\nwhat the final product will look like early on since you create a detailed\nspec. Furthermore, since you do a lot of work up front creating the\nrequirements, you might find and fix an issue in that phase. It\u2019s significantly\ncheaper to fix a problem early on. Because the scope is fixed early on,", "Engineering can make close-to-optimal design decisions for the project\nrather than designing for potential unknowns. Third-party development firms\noften like working with waterfall with clients because they can budget a\nproject based upon the work they\u2019ve agreed to do. Clients (and PMs) often\nlike it because they don\u2019t need to be involved day to day in managing the\nproject. Management also often likes the clear and easily understandable\nmilestones in a project, and you can measure progress by what percentage of\nthe spec is implemented.\nBut there are also significant drawbacks to waterfall that have caused many\nsoftware teams to move away from it. These problems include the following:\nCustomers might not know their exact requirements up front. Because\nwaterfall focuses on specifying and building something complete rather than\non fast iterations, what you build initially might not meet the customers\u2019\nneeds. And by the time you have a new version addressing their needs, you\nmight find that the customers have long since stoppe d using your product\nand sought out another answer.\nThere\u2019s no good  way to handle changes. After the requirements stage, you\nmight find new data that affects the product, and waterfall doesn\u2019t let you go\nback upstream to change decisions in earlier stages.\nThere is no time-boxing on each step, and the release often slips. One of\nthe most common problems is that there were technological unknowns and\ncoding the solution took much longer than intended, so a three-month project\nestimate actually took six months to complete. You had to invest those extra\nthree months because otherwise you wouldn\u2019t have a product.", "It can take so long to move through stages that a good  decision you\nmade initially might be the wrong decision when you release the\nproduct. For example, maybe you thought customers wanted a certain\nproduct, but after building it you discovered the market conditions changed\nand they no longer wanted it.\nIf you\u2019re working on a product where the requirements and technology are\nwell known, waterfall is a reasonable approach. If your company is using a\nwaterfall system, the best thing you can do as a PM is validate the PRD as\nmuch as possible initially to prevent changes later, and try to learn quickly if\nthe market likes your idea.\nIn most cases, waterfall\u2019s shortcomings outweigh its benefits. Many\nsoftware teams\u2014including that of the Department of Defense\u2014have\nswitched to more iterative development approaches. There are numerous\nones with various names, and some are still very waterfall-ish, but\neventually you will encounter the second main development methodology,\nagile development.<<<SECTION_BREAK>>>\nAgile Development\nAgile development is fundamentally about being flexible, iterating quickly,\nand embracing changes. Unfortunately, \u201cagile\u201d has become a somewhat\ngeneric and vague term much like \u201cbig data.\u201d Many companies claim to\nfollow agile practices or use words from agile methodologies to describe\ntheir process, when in fact their workflows aren\u2019t at all agile. Let\u2019s look at\nwhat agile really means and then at specific implementations.\nThe Manifesto for Agile Software Development defines key principles of\nagile, including these:", "Individuals and i nteractions over processes and tools\nWorking software over comprehensive documentation\nCustomer collabor ation over contract negotiation\nRespondi ng to change  over following a plan\nInstead of a fully fleshed out, staged approach, agile follows an incremental\napproach. With agile you plan out a relatively small unit of work, build what\nyou need to, and evaluate what you built. Then you use that knowledge to\nplan the next work to do. These small units of work can be organized either\naround time, in which case they\u2019re called a sprint, or around the number of\ntasks a team can work on at once, called a cycle.\nThere are multiple agile development methodology implementations you\ncan use as starting point for your team\u2019s agile workflow, and you can adapt\nan approach for your team\u2019s dynamic. What matters is that you\u2019re open to\nchange, iterating quickly, and building working software, not focused on how\nyou get there.\nFor agile to be truly effective, you need to embrace the lean principles\nwe\u2019ve advoc ated throughout this book , like building a minimum viable\nproduct (MVP) rather than the fully featured product. In other words, build\nsomething small as quickly as possible, learn from it, and then iterate in the\nnext sprint/cycle.\nShort sprints\u2014one or two weeks\u2014or continuous deployment are ideal with\nagile, as they let you move quickly and get feedback. If you were to try to\nexecute an agile process with a six-month sprint, you\u2019d encounter many of the\ndisadvantages we listed for waterfall, like how the customer\u2019s needs might\nchange while you\u2019re building the product and you have no mechanism to get\nfeedback or make changes during a sprint.", "Agile and lean also lead to a breadth-first approach where each sprint or\ncycle will\u2014ideally\u2014produce a usable piece of software that you can use to\nget feedback from customers or clients. In waterfall you\u2019re much more likely\nto schedule milestones so that part of the product is deemed feature-complete\nbefore moving on to another part, scheduling for depth. With agile,\nsprints/cycles are usually focused on getting to a very minimal but functional\napp initially and then adding features to each section as needed, scheduling\nfor breadth.\nFurthermore, the team will do incremental testing on the code during each\nsprint/cycle, which leads to a higher-quality product with fewer bugs.\nStudies have shown it\u2019s up to 20 times cheaper to find and fix bugs as you\nbuild a product rather than doing separate development and testing stages\nlike in waterfall.\nUnfortunately, there are some downsides to agile, especially for PMs. Agile\nworkflows frequently put a lot more demands on you, sometimes even having\nyou handle quality assurance/bug testing in addition to everything else you\u2019re\ndoing.\nHaving more milestones more often also puts additional demands on you to\nkeep validating builds with customers, but you\u2019ll need to work to find the\nright balance of wanting feedback and deciding which builds to validate.\nMaking sure a customer wants something before spending tons of time\nbuilding it really is a big net win. After all, if you find you\u2019re building the\nwrong thing, you can pivot before spending more time on it. But it would take\nall of your time and not always yield useful information if you tried to\nvalidate every build.\nSimilarly, in an agency model clients sometimes dislike agile because they\nhave to be more involved in the project, consistently scheduling and", "prioritizing.\nOne of the biggest criticisms of agile, however, comes from developers. If\nyou\u2019re building something new/trying to solve a hard problem, agile\u2019s heavy\nfocus on delivering something usable within a sprint (and the various\nassociated practices) is counter to thinking deeply and solving a problem.\nOften, developers discover that the best way to find a creative solution to a\nhard problem is to isolate oneself, focus deeply, experiment, and reemerge\nwhen they have a solution. There are ways to avoid this shortcoming, such as\nleveraging scrum spikes\u2014a user story to investigate something\u2014or having\nexplicit R&D sprints where a developer\u2019s only task is to try to solve one\nproblem. Just being aware that this is a frustration for developers will help\nyou make planning decisions that take it into account.\nAgile can also be tricky to scale to large teams. See the \u201cFurther Reading\u201d\nsection for information about Agile Release Trains to help scale. There\u2019s\nalso a ramp-up curve before you hit full productivity when implementing an\nagile workflow.\nAgile critics say that it leads to reactionary development, as you\u2019re\nresponding to what customers want now, rather than planning out a roadmap\nand maintaining a product vision. We feel it\u2019s quite possible to have an\noverall thematic roadmap with projects defined and communicated by PRDs,\nbuilt using agile/lean methodologies, where the exact details change as you\nfind out how customers use your product.\nDespite the various criticisms, the Standish Group, an IT advisory center,\ntracked 50,000 projects from 2011 through 2015 and found that the success\nrate (shipping a working product) of agile products was 39% vs. 11% with\nwaterfall. That\u2019s a huge difference, but note that even with agile 61% of\nprojects don\u2019t have a working product by the end.", "Let\u2019s look at two of the most popu lar ways agile methodology is\nimplemented: scrum and Kanban.<<<SECTION_BREAK>>>\nScrum\nScrum development is based on an idea from rugby, specifically that a team\u2019s\nfunctioning as a team, and not as a group of individuals, is key to success,\nand the best teams are given direction but can devise their own tactics for\nhow to achieve their goals. Scrum came about in the early \u201990s whereas agile\nwas formalized in the early \u201900s, but scrum\u2019s architects were part of the\ngroup that created the Agile Alliance.\nAt a high level, with software development, using scrum means that the\nteam comes together to prioritize what to do next and set short-term goals for\nwhat work to finish. You as the PM will have very strong input into that part\nof the process. Then the team goes off and figures out how to best do that\nwork. You\u2019ll check in with the team members at the start of each day as they\nwork, addressing any questions, and you\u2019ll validate the work when they say\nit\u2019s ready. But you don\u2019t micro-manage them or change their goals before\nthey\u2019re done with the current set.\nScrum is one of the most common approaches to agile because it has a very\nclearly defined project structure with clear team roles. This makes it easy for\na company transitioning from waterfall to agile to adopt scrum. And even if\ncompanies don\u2019t fully implement scrum, they often borrow ideas from it, such\nas daily stand-up/check-in meetings.\nScrum uses time-boxed sprints, most commonly one or two weeks. Each\nweek, you meet with the engineering team to perform backlog grooming. A\nproduct\u2019s backlog is the collection of all the bugs and suggestions, generally\nwritten as user stories, for the product.", "Grooming simply means you make sure the bugs and sugs are organized and\nhave enough clarity to act on. For example, we\u2019ve all seen\u2014and maybe sent\n\u2014poor ly written software bugs that just say \u201cit crashed.\u201d That\u2019s not helpful.\nIn grooming, you\u2019d do what you could to add steps to reproduce the crash\nand attach a crash log to the issue so that the team could eventually fix the\nbug. In addition to adding clarity, during grooming you will make sure each\nnew item for the backlog has acceptance criteria: How do you know the item\nis done properly?. Furthermore, we like writing backlog tasks as user stories\nbecause that format helps explain why something is an issue so that Design\nand Engineering can determine the best approach to address the issue.\nAlso during the grooming meeting, the engineering team will assess the\ncomplexity of the new or updated stories, breaking them down into sub-tasks\nif necessary. It\u2019s tough to know exactly how hard a task is or how many hours\nit will take, so you\u2019ll often see complexity measured using relatively\nweighted story points. Teams might assign one point to an easy task, two\npoints to a medium task, four points to a hard task, and eight points to a very\nhard task. The idea is that you don\u2019t know exactly how hard something is, but\nyou can say that one thing should be twice as hard as another.\nAfter assessing the complexity, your role as the product owner will be to\nprovide rough prioritization for any new items along with existing backlog\nitems based on customer need, business value, and longer-term goals/needs.\nYour goal with this prioritization is to have the most important thing to work\non next at the top of  the backlog.\nBacklogs often grow quite large, and there\u2019s usually a big chunk of stuff on\nit that you\u2019re just not going to be able to get to, along with things that are cool\nbut not relevant in the immediate future. Teams often create a second list,\ncalled an icebox, for these less-immediately-relevant-but-things-you-don\u2019t-", "want-to-forget stories. Stories in the icebox can be \u201cunfrozen\u201d and moved to\nthe backlog, but you won\u2019t actively work on icebox items. As we discussed\nin previous chapters, there will be a lot of potential features and ideas to\nmake the product better. You will be saying \u201cno\u201d a lot to make sure the\nproject doesn\u2019t get out of hand! Putting something in the icebox instead of\nexplicitly saying \u201cno\u201d is a nice way to make people feel their input is valued\nwhile avoiding feature creep.\nLater, you\u2019ll have another planning meeting where you determine the sprint\nbacklog. The sprint backlog is simply the list of user stories the team intends\nto complete during the sprint. You\u2019ll pick the key things you want to work on\nbased on priority/business value, and the engineering team will agree on\nwhether they can commit to it during the sprint.\nA common question is, how do you know how many backlog items to pick\nfor a sprint? Over time, you\u2019ll find that the team tends to complete n story\npoints per sprint. That number is called the sprint velocity. During this\nplanning meeting, if you add up the story points on the tasks everyone agrees\nto do, i t should come out to that velocity.\nIf you\u2019re struggling with how to prioritize what to do, try calculating a\npriority score by adding a Business Value field to each story, like we\nsuggested in Moving Forward section at the end of Chapter 4. Factors that go\ninto the business value can include how much you believe this will help you\nachieve a goal, how many customers are asking for this, if there\u2019s an\nimportant technical reason you need to do this, and so on. Then, calculate a\npriority score by dividing the business value by the complexity. High-value,\nlow-complexity stories will have a high score. High-value, high-complexity\nstories will have a mid-range score. Low-value, high-complexity stories will\nhave a low score. This approach is especially useful if your team is", "responsible for multiple products and you have to balance each product\u2019s\nneeds during sprint planning.\nNote that you won\u2019t change the sprint backlog during the sprint, as that\ndisrupts the team and can throw off the sprint velocity, which affects\nplanning. This lack of change encourages you to have shorter sprints,\nespecially when priorities are shifting, so that you can balance reacting to\nchange with letting the team function effectively.\nYou\u2019ll also find that scrum requires more attention to the balance between\nbuilding the right thing (what PMs want), building the thing right (what\nengineers want), and building it fast (what scrum masters want so they can\nget feedback quickly). It\u2019s quite likely that you will accumulate technical debt\n\u2014that is, the code will have some funkiness in it that Engineering had to\nbuild to deliver something in time.\nIt\u2019s OK to have a little technical debt to get short-term customer value, but\nlots of technical debt can reduce your team\u2019s velocity. During sprints, you\u2019ll\nperiodically need to accept work that pays off that technical debt even though\nthere\u2019s no visible customer value. For example, if we rewrote Moove r from\nObjective-C to Swift, there wouldn\u2019t be any immediate customer value, but it\ncould make it easier to add new features going forward, improving the team\u2019s\nvelocity.\nDuring the sprint, you\u2019ll have short, 15-minute meetings called stand-ups at\nthe start of each workday, where each team member states what she did\nduring the past day, what she aims to accomplish today, and if she has any\nblocking issues.\nAt the end of the sprint, you\u2019ll have a demo meeting with key\nstakeholders/the customer/the client to show what you\u2019ve built and gauge\ntheir feedback, and an internal sprint retrospective to assess how the sprint", "went.\nWhen done well, while combining scrum and lean methodologies, scrum\ntends to provide a very nice balance of planning ahead and tolerating change,\nwhich we\u2019ve found valuable. Since each sprint ideally produces something\nusable, you can break down a bigger plan specified in a PRD into smaller\nmilestones and validate what you\u2019re building at key points with customers\nand stakeholders to make sure you\u2019re on the right path. If you\u2019re not, pivot\nbefore building more.\nWhen you start a new project, scrum is especially helpful. Early on in a\nproject, there\u2019s a lot of risk (business, technical, and more). By focusing on\nsprints and tasks that de-risk the project, you might have low initial customer\nvalue but enable rapid progress later.\nFor example, when planning Moove r\u2019s new customer messaging feature, we\nmight focus on making messaging back and forth between customers and\nmovers work initially, not paying any attention to a good user experience.\nThis will let us test and make sure that this core piece works. If the\ndevelopment team finds out that its initial approach has some big limitation\n(e.g., maybe it\u2019s constantly blocked by a firewall), the team can come up with\na better solution. And if it turns out that the core piece isn\u2019t do-able, you can\nreassess what you\u2019re building without the team\u2019s wasting time on non-core\npieces.\nScrum also makes project management easier, as you can use story points\nand the total story points for outstanding items in the product backlog to\ncreate trend lines. These trend lines let you estimate when the project will be\ndone with a feature set, along with how much work will be done on a certain\ndate.\nIf you have to make a schedule tradeoff, we\u2019d recommend reducing the", "project\u2019s scope rather than extending the schedule. That way you make sure\nyou have something done by the deadline, and if you finish early you can\nincrease the scope.\nUnfortunately, scrum has some problems. Some of these problems have\neven led to cries that \u201cagile is dead.\u201d The heart of that argument is that the\nagile movement was suppos ed to be about individuals and interactions and\nresponding to change. Scrum has become synonymous with agile, yet\nimplementing scrum is often more about process over individuals, and\nchange has been limited to enable better planning. In other words, \u201cagile\u201d has\nbeen bastardized to be just as rigid as waterfall.\nStand-up meetings are a great example of that rigidity. The goal is to keep\nthe team apprised of what\u2019s going on and to help unblock any issues at the\nstart of each day. But if your team starts its day at different times or works in\ndifferent time zones, stand-up meetings aren\u2019t effective because they\u2019ll be at\nthe start of the day for one person but hours into the day for another. Plus,\nthese check-ins all too often become an easy way for managers to micro-\nmanage while claiming it\u2019s part of scrum. Despite these shortcomings, the\nteams still hold their stand-ups because that\u2019s what scrum says to do. A  better\napproach would be to create new ways to communicate, like agile\nencourages, such as posting a status update to Slack at the end of the day\nrather than holding a stand-up.\nScrum can also create headaches for you. It\u2019s often up to the product\nmanager to do acceptance testing, making sure each user story is completed\ncorrectly and without bugs. This can be very demanding of your time, and\nwhen you combine it with everything else you have to do, it\u2019s easy to get\nsloppy  and miss bugs that a dedicated QA team would have caught.\nA final downside to scrum is that while you\u2019re seeing progress more", "frequently than with waterfall, in the best-case scenario you still have to wait\na whole sprint to see the latest and greatest. While that might be fine for a\nnew feature, it can be very frustrating for bug fixes! Given how easy it is to\nrelease software in today\u2019s world, such as with web apps, there are alternate\nagile approaches worth looking at, such as Kanban.<<<SECTION_BREAK>>>\nKanban\nKanban development comes from Toyota, which came up with this\nmethodology by looking at how supermarkets stock shelves. Specifically,\nsupermarkets aim to be \u201cjust in time\u201d so that the shelves are neither empty\nnor overstocked with wasted, expired food. W hile Toyota used this technique\nto build cars efficiently, it is often applied to software, too.\nKanban\u2019s goal is to match the team\u2019s capacity to do work with how much\nwork is actually happening. Additionally, there should be a few tasks ready\nto go so that if a team finished n story points of work, they can immediately\nstart working on a task requiring another n points to complete. This is nice\nbecause your future priorities can change with very little impact on the\nteam\u2019s current work.\nIn Kanban, you will typically create a task board showing what\u2019s up next\n(to-do), in progress, ready to be tested/verified, and done. Tasks will move\nfrom one column to the next, and you\u2019ll know how much work the team can\nhandle at once along with how many things it can verify at once.\nWhile many agile methodologies are time-based, Kanban isn\u2019t. Instead, the\nPM will work with the dev team to reprioritize the backlog and make sure\nthat the most important items are always next up and their difficulty estimates\nare accurate. This leads Kanban teams to focus on cycle time: how long it\ntakes from the moment you start a unit of work until it ships.", "Many little things can hurt cycle time, such as one person having\nspecialized and required knowledge for the task, along with multitasking.\nTherefore, Kanban encourages teams to learn skills outside their domains\u2014\nso that everyone could test, for example, if there\u2019s work piling up in the\n\u201cready to be verified\u201d queue and holding up the next phase\u2014and to stay\nfocused by keeping the amount of work in progress small.\nOne of the biggest benefits to Kanban is that it enables continuous\ndeployment. Once a change moves through the cycle, it\u2019s ready to be\nreleased. Especially for web apps, this is quite nice and enables immediate\ncustomer feedback.\nKanban is also nice because it can be implemented on top of other\nmethodologies. It\u2019s really just a focus on incremental, continuous\nimprovement to the product. In general, if your team is already using a\nworkflow and executing well, Kanban might help the team move to the next\nlevel. But if your team needs help becoming more efficient in general,\nshaking things up by focusing on implementing another agile process, Kanban\nmight not be the right place to start. That\u2019s because Kanban is a much less\nformalized method than scrum, and it can be harder to understand how to\nimplement it initially.\nSometimes you\u2019ll see Kanban combined with scrum\u2014called \u201cscrumban\u201d)\n\u2014which was originally intended as a way to transition from scrum to\nKanban but has become a methodology of its own. Here, the team will have a\nplanning meeting, execute a very short sprint, and then have another planning\nmeeting when the work in progress falls below a certain number of story\npoints. There are no predefined roles or fixed schedules, and the iterations\nare focused on points delivered rather than time.\nHowever, while Kanban is great for development teams, it can be very hard", "on PMs. PMs are frequently quite busy, working with customers, shepherding\nproducts, working with marketing, and more. Kanban requires us to also be\navailable continuously to verify each task is completed (acceptance testing)\nand to make sure the next set of tasks is prioritized and ready to go (backlog\ngrooming). If you don\u2019t continuously do these tasks, you might become the\nbottleneck for the whole team!\nOverall, remember that with agile, individuals and interactions are the most\nimportant element\u2014more important than processes and tools. This means that\nyou shouldn\u2019t worry about following a word-for-word implementation of a\nspecific methodology. Start somewhere and figure out what works best for\nyour team. And don \u2019t be afraid to try a new approach.<<<SECTION_BREAK>>>\nWORKING WITH REMOTE TEAMS\nA common challenge PMs face is how to work with development teams that\naren\u2019t in the same physical space or even the same time zone. While there\u2019s\nno one right answer, clear communication is the key. This doesn\u2019t mean an\nexpectation of non-stop communication and constant availability, but rather\nhaving regular check-ins and using tools like Google Hangouts to see each\nother and remember that you\u2019re working with a person.\nYou can play a big part in helping remote teams be successful by over-\ncommunicating requirements, goals, decisions, and the definition of \u201cdone\u201d\nfor the project so that everyone feels like they\u2019re on the same team and has a\nclear understanding of what they\u2019re working towards, regardless of where\ntheir desks sit. Sometimes important decisions or clarifications happen in a\nhallway conversation, and unless you pay attention, a remote developer might\nnot hear about that decision, or might feel left out of the decision-making\nprocess.", "Creating a culture where people don\u2019t think twice about having a quick\nvideo chat can help replicate the face-to-face interaction that happens\nnaturally in a single location. Too often, we still think of a video conference\nas a formal, scheduled time\u2014it doesn\u2019t have to be that way.\nFurthermore, be aware of when people are starting or ending their days. Is\nthere something that team A can do at the end of its day that you need for the\nstart of your day? Or is there something you can get done by the end of your\nday so that when team B starts, it\u2019s not blocked? It can even be helpful to\nestablish \u201cgolden hour\u201d handoff meetings so that these needs get\ncommunicated clearly at the start and end of each team\u2019s workday.\nAgile helps a lot with remote teams because it forces you to think about the\nadaptable nature of agile to figure out workflows that work well for you. For\nexample, scrum works well with remote teams because you can plan what to\ndo, let people work independently, and still conduct daily stand-ups.\nDepending on what time zones people are in, you might have to conduct daily\nstand-ups asynchronously via email or instant message throughout the day\nrather than having everyone together at the same time. Additionally, at the\nreview meeting, rather than trying to accommodate everyone\u2019s schedule and\npossibly making the meeting inconvenient for the stakeholders, try having the\nproduct owner, rather than individual developers, present the overall team\u2019s\nwork to the stakeholders.\nThe biggest thing that remote teams miss out on is the natural team-building\nthat happens when people spend their days together. It\u2019s important to get your\nteam together in the same place periodically, even if it\u2019s just for team-\nbuilding exercises. Product managers should have empathy for their teams,\nnot just for their customers. Spending time together is a good way to develop\nsolid relationships.<<<SECTION_BREAK>>>", "WORKING WITH THIRD-PARTY DEVELOPMENT\nTEAMS\nIf you\u2019re a software PM, there\u2019s a good chance that at some point you will\nwork on a project with a third-party development team. This means that the\nproject\u2019s developers aren\u2019t company employees, but rather employees of a\ndevelopment agency you\u2019ve hired. Companies usually engage a third-party\ndevelopment team when they\u2019re resource-constrained\u2014a  start-up may not\nhave had time or funds to build a full-time development team, or in an larger\ncompany may want to take on a project its internal team doesn\u2019t have time to\ndo. Sometimes you\u2019ll also hire a third-party team because they have a\nparticular skill that you have a short-term need of, such as expertise in a\nspecific API.\nAs a product manager, you\u2019ll handle a lot of the interaction between your\ncompany and this team, and you can do a few things to ensure success. The\nbiggest is to make sure you\u2019re communicating the requirements, goals, and\ndeadlines to the third-party team clearly. Take the time to address any\npotentially confusing elements as they arise. Writing everything down on a\nshared project-management resource such as Basecamp will help ensure\neveryone has access to the same information and key decisions. Coordinate\nthe timelines and progress with any stakeholders internally to make sure\neverything looks good. It\u2019s often better to over-communicate, especially at\nfirst.\nIt\u2019s also very helpful if you establish frequent milestones with the external\nteam. If that team is internally using an agile process, this should be easy. The\nbenefit is that you can see what they\u2019re building, and if something isn\u2019t\nheading in the right direction\u2014whether because of a miscommunication or\nbecause you made a mistake in what you needed to build\u2014y ou can address it", "early. Just like with an internal development team, if you give a third-party\nteam a large spec and then only check in three months later, what they\u2019ve\nbuilt might, unintentionally, not be what you wanted or what you need.\nHaving a solid short-term plan is also very helpful, as it lets agencies\nschedule their developers efficiently on your project. In fact, some agencies\nprefer to let work queue up until they have a sprint\u2019s worth on your project\nbefore prioritizing it. Frequently changing what you\u2019re asking for is\nfrustrating for development agencies, as it makes it hard for the agency to to\nplan the project longer term and to gauge when it\u2019ll finish your project and\nwhen it can take on new work.\nAbove  all, just like you would with an internal team, look at an external\ndevelopment agency as a partner. Be respectful of the agency\u2019s skills, time,\nand needs, and it\u2019ll likely do g reat work for you.\nHowever, while there are many great external development firms, there are\nsome sketchy ones, so you should know a few warning signs. Like when\nyou\u2019re buying a used car, if your contact keeps telling you what a great value\nyou\u2019re getting, he\u2019s likely overcharging you. If your contact never asks\nquestions to clarify each user story or make an effort to clarify and deliver\nthe acceptance criteria, you should be wary. If your contact ignores questions\nyou ask except on your check-in calls, you should also be alert.\nBe watchful of how agile agencies assign story points to user stories for\nwhich they use a pre-built in-house framework. Specifically, many agencies\nhave built up libraries of common functions, such as server code for account\nmanagement. A good agency that\u2019s using its library to complete user stories\nwill estimate these user stories as \u201ceasy.\u201d This is honest and lets you\ncalculate sprint velocity effectively. A sketchy agency will list a hard\nestimate for the user stories, claiming all the original work it took to develop", "the library as part of your story, even though it\u2019s trivial for the agency to\nimplement. Then the agency will tell you how much it kicked butt for the\nsprint because its team accomplished hundreds of story points, even though it\nreally only did 10 story points\u2019 worth of work. That claim messes up the\nsprint velocity and planning calculations, and it\u2019s a sure sign you should find\na new agency.\nNo matter where your team members are located, whether they\u2019re in-house\nor external, and whether they use Kanban or waterfall, we say that the\ndevelopment phase of the product life cycle is done when working, tested\nsoftware that meets your product requirements is ready for release. Your role\nduring the development phase comes down to providing clear requirements\nfor the engineering team members, working with them to prioritize and\nreprioritize as needed, and trusting them to build great code. Now that we\u2019ve\nbuilt our product, let\u2019s look at how we launch and market it.<<<SECTION_BREAK>>>\n________ \nCHAPTER 7 TIP\nMoham mad Musa, a Produc t School instructor, provides this chapter\u2019s tip.\nMoham mad is cofounde r of a stealth start-up focused on virtual reality for\nenterprises. He used to work at Google on company wide efforts to enable\nteams to build produc ts more effectively. He worked specifically on\ninfrastructure produc ts for tracking user-centered metrics, bug\nmanage ment, and user-feedbac k loops . Prior to that, he was the head of", "Launc h & Readiness at Google Apps for Work, where he led a cross-\nfunctional team managi ng product launc hes, produc t roadm ap, trusted\ntester, and launc h communications. Before joining Google, Moham mad\nworked in software engineering and technical sales positions in the video\ngames and s emiconduc tor indus tries, mostly in small start-ups.\nWORKING WITH JUNIOR DEVELOPMENT TEAMS\nIf you are a software PM, you will need to work hand-in-hand with the software engineering manager\n(often called tech lead manager or TLM in companies like Google, Facebook, and Twitter). The TLM\nmanages a number of software engineers with variable seniority levels. The more senior engineers are\noften referred to as tech leads (TLs). The TLs may or may not have management responsibility over\nthe other team members.\nThe TL reports to the TLM and handles most of the day-to-day work assignment and helps the team\nunblock technical challenges for a particular project.\nIf you are lucky, you will be working with an experienced TLM and/or TL who has mentored and\nmanaged many engineers in the past. The TLM or TL will take care of training and advising the junior\ndevelopers on the team without requiring extra cycles from you as the PM.\nHowever, in reality you don\u2019t always get an experienced TL or TLM. Or sometimes you may get a\ngreat but busy TLM that has 15-plus engineers reporting to him/her. In these cases, your role as the PM\nwill need to expand to best help the team succeed. In my experience, I found that working with junior\ndevelopers requires the PM to do more work around scrum management, quality, and product or feature\ndefinition.\nFirst off, with regards to scrum, the junior developers are not used to user story estimation. Their\nestimates are usually off and they often think that a story is complete while there is still a lot of work left\nto be done. These premature stories can cause embarrassment in front of stakeholders if not enough\nQA has been completed. Second, and closely related to the first point, you really need to do a lot more\nQA around the work that junior developers have completed. You may not have a QA team at all and\neven if you do, the scripted tests may not catch all the errors that have been introduced by someone\nwho does not know the system very well. This is exacerbated in complex software systems that are\nalready suffering from coverage and quality problems.\nFinally, around requirements and definition: As the PM, you need to assume that the junior team", "members are like new users who have only casually used your product. You can\u2019t count on quick\nhallway or chat conversations to agree on minor details and just move on. You really have to document\nand make sure that junior team members have internalized what you are asking them to do. This will\ninclude more detailed user story descriptions, detailed mocks and user journeys/scenarios, and detailed\nacceptance criteria.\nWithin six to eight sprints, the junior members will better understand the product complexities and\nrequirements. To speed up understanding and shorten the learning curve, it would be ideal for your team\nto develop more user empathy. Encourage your engineering team to monitor user research sessions or\nconduct informal customer-discovery conversations with users directly (if possible). More knowledge of\nthe user persona and their pain points helps the entire team become more experienced and helps junior\ndevelopers take more ownership and pride in their work.<<<SECTION_BREAK>>>", "At this point you\u2019ve found an opportunity, validated it, gotten your team on\nboard, and built a product. You\u2019ve done a lot! In fact, if you come from an\nengineering or design background, you might feel like the hard work\u2019s over\nand you can take a vacation. But for a product manager, there\u2019s still more\nwork to do to get your product into the market successfully. As the team at\nPragmatic Marketing, a product-marketing-focused agency, puts it, \u201cLaunch\nisn\u2019t the end of development but rather the beginning of selling.\u201d\nAs much as we\u2019d like to believe that if we built the perfect product it will\nsell itself, the harsh truth is that it won\u2019t. If none of your target customers\nknow about, find, or buy your product, it will flop. If the wrong people buy", "your product, they won\u2019t be happy and your product will flop. Unless you\nhave a solid plan to bring your product to market, it will most likely flop.\nFortunately, marketing and sales teams exist to make sure the right customers\nlearn about, find, and buy your product!\nTo ensure a successful launch, you will work closely with the marketing\nteam. Some companies even have a second role within marketing related to\nproduct management, the product marketing manager (PMM). Put simply, the\nPMM is focused externally and is an expert on the customer\u2014and the buyer, if\nthat\u2019s not the same person, such as in enterprise software\u2014whereas the PM\nwill focus internally on getting the product built. Companies that have a PM\nand a PMM call the PM \u201cinbound\u201d and a PMM \u201coutbound\u201d to reflect this\ndiffering focus.\nWorkflow-wise, the PMM will often handle customer development and\noutreach, the PM will take that feedback and research and get the right product\nbuilt, and the PMM will step back in for launch. During launch, a PMM is\nresponsible for figuring out how to explain the product to the customers,\ncrafting the right go-to-market (GTM) plan to bring the product to market\nsuccessfully, and helping the sales team. We\u2019ll go through this chapter as if the\nPM and the PMM are the same person to give you the best understanding of\nhow product and marketing come together during launch.\nBy representing the customer, the marketing and sales team will often ask for\nthe PM\u2019s input when forming strategies. For example, if your product is aimed\nat teens, the PM will know that teens currently use Snapchat and Instagram\nmore than Facebook . The marketing team will use that input as a starting point\nto determine where to buy display ads. While you won\u2019t be responsible for\nthe details of buying display ads, your input will affect where those ads are\nand what they say.", "Throughout this chapter, we\u2019ll look at launch preparation, at the launch itself,\nand a bit at post-launch activities. Launch preparation starts way before the\nproduct launches with understanding your customers and product messaging.\nEven though we\u2019re covering this material after the product\u2019s been built, you\nwill implement this advice while you\u2019re building this product.\nWhether you\u2019re releasing a new version of an existing product with minor\nfixes or releasing a completely new big product, the advice in this chapter\nwill help you. You\u2019ll just adjust the scale appropriately. A bug-fix release\ndoesn\u2019t need a press tour, for example.<<<SECTION_BREAK>>>\nUNDERSTANDING CUSTOMERS\nTo market your product successfully, you\u2019ll need to know how your customers\nmake decisions. Thinking about marketing early on, even when you\u2019re doing\nyour initial customer development, will help your product enter the market\nsuccessfully. For example, your customers might expect to buy your product at\nBest Buy. It can take months for your sales team to set up the relationship so\nthat your product is available in store, which means you can\u2019t wait until\nlaunch to start the process.\nBack in Chapter 3, we introduced the Business Model Canvas and the Value\nPropos ition Canvas. At the time, we used them to help look for a product\noppor tunity. We can use the same tools to understand how to best market our\nproduct to the right customers by looking at different parts of the canvas. For\nreference, Figure 8-1 shows the Business Model Canvas (also shown in\nChapter 3 as Figure 3-5).", "Figure 8-1: The Business Model Canvas, from http://strategyzer.com, provides insight for how to\nmarket your product.\nThese are the key areas to focus on from a marketing point of view:\nCustomer segments: Who are the key personas?\nValue propositions: What\u2019s the benefit/value each persona will gain\nfrom your product?\nChannels: How does the company reach each persona?\nCustomer relationships: What communication level and type does\neach persona expect?\nRevenue streams: How much and how often will the customer pay?\nAs you do your customer research, you\u2019ll want to fill out these blocks and\nexpand your persona to include the marketing side. Here are some specific\nthings to make sure your personas address:", "How the persona would consider your product a success\nHow the persona perceives your product/company (if you have an\nexisting product)\nWhat buying criteria the persona has\nHow the persona evaluates products (e.g., does he expect a free\ntrial?)\nHow the persona perceives your competition\nWhat influence this persona has on the buying process\nBy fleshing out the marketing side of a persona, you\u2019ll help the marketing team\nmake successful decisions. For example, your persona might focus on new\nparents who look for advice online. Then the marketing team will do\nadditional research to determine what parenting websites and blogs the actual\ncustomers read, along with where they buy diapers and other supplies. In\nother words, once you know what your personas are, you and the team can\nfigure out what channels the customers they represent use to learn about and\npurchase new products. That lets your team make choices, like where to buy\nadvertising, so that the right people find your product.\nThe Customer Relationship block will help your team determine how to\nreach these customers, too. With an enterprise product and a high-value\ncustomer that purchases a lot of licenses, the customer likely expects her\naccount manager to talk to her personally and maybe even come to her office\nto give a demo. Again, make sure the choices you make for customer\nrelationships match your customers\u2019 expectations.\nSometimes, especially if you\u2019re releasing a completely new version of a\nproduct, you\u2019ll want to call out any customer segments the product isn\u2019t ready\nfor yet. For example, when Apple released Final Cut Pro X, which was a", "completely rewritten version of Final Cut, it left out certain advanced features\nand waited for customer feedback to determine which to add back in. This\nalso meant that Apple explicitly didn\u2019t market the product to customers they\nknew needed those advanced features, as those customers wouldn\u2019t have been\nsatisfied with this new version.<<<SECTION_BREAK>>>\nProduct Messaging\nOne of the most important things the Business Model Canvas and the Value\nPropos ition Canvas can help you and your team determine is the right product\nmessage. Specifically, how do you communicate your product\u2019s value to\ncustomers and explain why they should care and what problems your product\nsolves? These canvases can help because they specifically ask you to think\nabout your customers\u2019 needs, problems, and goals along with what problems\nyour product solves and what benefits it provides to your target customers.\nFraming your product in this way\u2014why should the customer care?\u2014helps\nwith everything from how you\u2019ll sell the product to what features really\nmatter. It\u2019s so important that back in Chapter 5, we recommended including at\nleast a first pass at your product\u2019s core message in the PRD. If you don\u2019t think\nabout the customers you\u2019re trying to reach and why they should care, then it\nwill be much harder to find customers. For example, if you\u2019re working on a\nnew version of a student-loan product, your focus will be on getting students\nand recent graduates to care about and buy your product.\nBefore you start creating your product\u2019s message, make sure you really\nunderstand the customer personas you\u2019re targeting and how your product fits\ntheir life. The Value Propos ition Canvas, especially, will help you see those\nconnections. In an ideal world, we\u2019d come up with one universal message that\naddresses all of your personas, but we\u2019ll likely need different messages for", "each persona.\nUsing the same message for every persona is like starting every letter you\nsend with \u201cDear sir,\u201d even if the recipient is a woman. And the same way that\nyou wouldn\u2019t greet someone in person with \u201cDear sir,\u201d you\u2019ll likely have\ndifferent messages for different mediums, from website to email to video ad.\nIn other words, it won\u2019t just be the message language that changes. Different\npersonas will want different value propos itions and care about different\nfeatures/use cases. A stay-at-home dad will likely care more about a car\u2019s\nsafety rating than its horsepower, whereas a dad having a midlife crisis will\ncare more about horsepower.\nPMs are frequently responsible for the first pass at a product\u2019s messages and\nwill have input into the various forms these messages takes. Let\u2019s dive into\nhow to craft a great message. We\u2019re going create a message by putting some\nnotes together around the elements that go into a message and then putting\nthose notes together into a message.<<<SECTION_BREAK>>>\nKey Elements of Your Product\u2019s Message\nWe\u2019ll start our notes by thinking about the product\u2019s themes, which we talked\nabout in Chapter 2. There are three key questions our theme should answer:\nWhy is this product/company important? Why are you doing this? What\u2019s\nspecial about your company\u2019s mission that will make a customer want your\nproduct over a competitor\u2019s? Ideally there will be one fundamental theme that\nanswers those three questions. Grab a blank sheet of paper and start writing\ndown what you think your company\u2019s core theme is. Revise what you write as\nneeded to make sure that theme applies to all three questions.\nLet\u2019s write down Moove r\u2019s theme. Moove r\u2019s founders created the company\nbecause they found planning a move to be overwhelmingly stressful,", "especially while working full-time. Their core theme is making moving as\nstress-free as possible so that it\u2019s easy for you to get to where you want to\nlive. While we might never explicitly say those words to customers, that\ntheme will guide our product messaging.\nAnother element to look at is what\u2019s fresh and new about the product: What\nare we building a message for? On your sheet of paper, create a new section\nwhere you list what\u2019s fresh and new. In Moove r\u2019s case, it\u2019s the chat feature.\nNote that the \u201cfresh and new\u201d part might differ for new versus existing\ncustomers. With Moove r, we can specifically tell existing customers about the\nmessaging feature. But when we try to reach new customers, we likely have to\neducate them about Moove r in general first, and the chat feature will be a\nbullet point beneath the main message. This is a common problem companies\nface, and it\u2019s just another reason you\u2019ll need different messages for different\ncustomers.\nRather than telling people about these fresh and new features, though, we\nwant to talk about the benefits they provide to the customer, using the\nunderlying theme and the customer\u2019s problems/needs to affect our diction.\nNext to each new feature you listed, write why the customer should care and\nhow this feature relates to the theme.\nMoove r\u2019s chat feature lets customers communicate with moving companies\nat the customers\u2019 convenience, not only from 9am to 5pm. We could rephrase\nthis to explain why a customer should care by writing, \u201cNever stress about\nmissing a phone call from the movers: talk with them on your schedule.\u201d\nContinuing with crafting your message, how is your product different and\nbetter than what the customer\u2019s doing now? This is especially relevant in the\nmessaging for new customers. In another section on your paper, create \u201cNow\u201d\nand \u201cFuture\u201d columns and write out what the customer\u2019s doing now and why", "your product, especially with this new feature, is better.\nRight now, Moove r\u2019s customers, both existing and potential, have to stress\nabout answering phone calls and not missing emails from moving companies,\neven when they\u2019re really busy dealing with life. We could further refine our\nmessage by saying, \u201cWe\u2019re taking the hassle out of talking to movers.\u201d This is\ngreat because it quickly encompasses all types of communication: \u201ctalking\u201d\ncan mean via phone or email. And we\u2019re saying why Moove r is better: it\u2019s\nhassle-free. This version of our message is also strong because it\u2019s positive\n(the previous message started with the negative \u201cnever\u201d) and it\u2019s in the\ncustomer\u2019s diction (\u201ctalking\u201d rather than \u201ccommunicating\u201d and \u201chassle\u201d rather\nthan \u201cstress\u201d).\nAnother aspect of your message is to address what someone\u2019s first\nimpression of your product might be, and whether you need to influence that\nimpression. Our first impressions have a big effect on our attitudes. For\nexample, the first time you see 3D software like Unity, it will look\noverwhelming and complex. Unity addresses this on its website by\nspecifically stating, \u201cYou can create any 2D or 3D game with Unity. You can\nmake it with ease.\u201d As another example, CleverPet is a game console for\ndogs, and at first glance it looks like it\u2019s just the memory game Simon even\nthough it costs $299. CleverPet\u2019s website explicitly calls out that it\u2019s \u201cOne\nhub. Unlimited games.\u201d This wording influences your first impression to know\nthat it\u2019s more than just Simon, and it helps justify the $299 pr ice.\nIn your notes for your product, write down what you feel each persona\u2019s first\nimpression of your product will be. If you need to influence that impression,\nwrite dow n how you want to shift the perception.<<<SECTION_BREAK>>>\nFinding Your Company\u2019s Voice", "After you\u2019ve assembled your notes, you\u2019ll want to think about your voice.\nThis refers to the diction and tone you will use in your marketing and\nadvertising materials, possibly also even inside the product, such as in alert\nmessages. Basically, do you want to have a very formal tone with your\ncustomers, a casual tone, a \u201chip\u201d tone, or something in between?\nEnterprise products traditionally have taken a formal tone to create a\n\u201cbusiness\u201d feeling and consumer products have adopted a casual tone to\ncreate a friendly and accessible feeling. The overriding trend now for both\nenterprise and consumer products is to have a more casual and authentic tone.\nHowever, some B2B products in highly regulated fields like medicine and\nfinance still have to use very formal and specific voices because the wrong\nlanguage can get you into legal trouble.\nSome companies will create formal style guidelines for their brand\u2019s voice\nand require everything, from alert panels in the product to every ad, to\nconform to those guidelines. This can make it hard to adapt your message for\ndifferent customers. Instead, we recommend having a general sense of the\nvoice you want your brand to have, but use that as a starting point and not a\nrequired approach. Just make sure you stay consistent within each\nmedium/message! It\u2019s confusing if you start a letter with \u201cDear sir\u201d and then\nswitch to \u201cHey, dude\u201d in the next paragraph.\nUsing similar diction to your customers can help your customers quickly\nunderstand your value propos ition. With consumer products, this means not\nusing industry jargon\u2014you\u2019ll likely need to cross out and rewrite some of\nyour \u201cwhy should the customer care?\u201d descriptions. For example, Microsoft\ndescribes its Surface devices as \u201cthe most productive devices on the planet\u201d\nand goes on to describe the Surface Book as \u201cthe ultimate laptop.\u201d Right\naway, you know if you\u2019re looking for a high-end laptop, this is the product you", "want to look at. If you want something to just browse the web, you also know\nthis isn\u2019t the right product. If Microsoft had instead listed each device\u2019s CPU\nspecs, most customers wouldn\u2019t know which product to look at.\nWith enterprise software or specific, targeted products, you often want to\nuse certain buzzwords that a customer is looking for. For example, if a head of\nIT at a hospital is looking to buy a medical records system, he likely cares\nabout compliance with government regulations. Calling out a specific\ncompliance level as part of the message helps him quickly know this product\nexactly meets his needs.\nA simple way to make sure you\u2019re using the right diction is to ask how a\ncustomer would tell a friend about your product. If their diction is similar to\nyours, excellent! If it\u2019s very different, reconsider your word choice. You want\nyour message to match how your customers see the world. Your message gets\nbonus points if it really creates images and evokes emotions in a customer\u2019s\nmind.<<<SECTION_BREAK>>>\nPutting the Message Pieces Together\nIf you were following along, you now have a few pages of notes and ideas for\nhow you could tell a customer about your product. That\u2019s excellent because,\nagain, there\u2019s no one message that works for all personas on all mediums. For\nexample, what you write in a press release will be different from what\u2019s on\nthe product\u2019s web page, and that will be different from how you advertise the\nproduct on TV. As another example, how many websites have you gone to that\nessentially ask you to pick your persona by choosing between text like \u201cFor\ndevelopers\u201d or \u201cFor designers\u201d? The messaging will be different on each\npage, focusing on the things each of those personas cares about.\nWhile you won\u2019t be responsible for creating ads, it\u2019s worth looking at ads to", "understand how other companies express their messages. Spend some time\nlooking at websites and watching ads for products you use, or know about.\nWhat is the company saying about each product? Is the message explicit or\nimplicit? What diction or imagery does the company use?\nVideo advertising is really interesting to analyze because the message is\noften implicit, and you\u2019ll have to think about what the company was trying to\nsay. Then note how it chose to convey it: What personas did it appeal to?\nHow did it make those personas clear? What emotions did the ad create?\nWatch Apple\u2019s classic 1984 ad or Google\u2019s Parisian Love ad to see two\nfantastic examples. 1984 focuses on how Macintosh enables you to stand out\nand break free of your constraints. Parisian Love examines how search\nchanges your life by giving you the answers you need. It\u2019s also worth\nexplicitly noting that these ads don\u2019t focus on the product\u2014they focus on your\nlife, the experience you want, and how the product helps you have that\nexperience.\nIn general, it\u2019s good to figure out the shortest possible message that appeals\nto the most personas. You\u2019ll likely use that message a lot, whether as a sound\nbite during a meeting with the press or as the headline on the product\u2019s page.\nThen, create different, more specific, and more targeted messages as needed,\nusing your notes to guide you.\nWe highly recommend taking a stab at determining this short message early\nin the product-development life cycle and then revising it as needed. This will\nhelp keep any product decisions focused (do they enhance/detract from the\nmessage?) and provide a starting point for discussions about how to bring the\nproduct to market.\nJust like writing user scenarios for stakeholders is the secret to good PRDs,\nwriting your message as a story can help it become clear and resonate more", "with customers. You can even use it to give increased value to something new\nthat might not seem exciting. For example, if your new feature is a tutorial\nsection on the website, tell a story about how the customer can use these\nsimple tutorials to become an expert on the product very quickly, leaving their\npeers in the dust.\nFinally, remember that your message is not about what the product does, it\u2019s\nabout what the product lets the customer do. Customers buy your product to\nmake their lives better. Make sure your message clearly highlights how your\nproduct will help your customers improve their lives.<<<SECTION_BREAK>>>\nGOING TO MARKET\nIt\u2019s tempting to think that once development\u2019s done and you\u2019ve put together an\ninitial product message in the PRD, you can just give the product to\nmarketing/sales and let them do their thing. But what happens if during launch\nyour server crashes and your engineering team is out of the office celebrating?\nOr worse, what if the marketing team didn\u2019t fully understand the product\u2019s\nnew features, targeted the wrong PR/advertising outlets, and no one showed\nup for the launch?\nMany companies create launch checklists, preset templates of the\ninformation the marketing team needs to launch a product. But the problem is\nthat not every product launch is the same, either in terms of the product you\u2019re\nlaunching or how people receive information. For example, a big product\nlaunch might warrant an event that you live-stream. Five years ago, live\nstreaming wasn\u2019t an easy option. In a couple of years, live streaming in virtual\nreality or some other way we can\u2019t imagine now might be the norm. And if\nyou\u2019re launching a new version of a small feature, you likely don\u2019t need a live\nstream at all.", "A great way to launch a product is to identify a launch owner early on, to\nform a team with representatives from each key group (Design, Engineering,\nProduct, Support, and Marketing), and to establish clear launch objectives and\nresponsibilities within a go-to-market (GTM) plan. Sometimes the launch\nowner is the PM, but PMs are often busy enough that someone else from the\nmarketing team will take on this role. Although the launch owner will\norganize and manage the GTM plan, each department will contribute to it.\nEach week, the team will meet to make sure everything is on track to ensure a\nsuccessful launch, and they\u2019ll communicate any delays or issues and discuss\nsolutions.\nFor these meetings, it\u2019s helpful to create a launch tracker to organize the\nlaunch. Three sheets in a spreadsheet are sufficient. The first sheet will\ncontain the action items. These are specific tasks, assigned to a particular\nperson/team, along with when each task was assigned, when it was due, and\nany comments/status updates appropriate for the task. The second sheet will\ncontain caution items. These are possible problem issues along with who\nraised them, when they raised them, when each issue was resolved, and any\ncomments. The last sheet will have key decisions, including who made them,\nwhen, and any comments. In the same way the PRD is a living document that\nacts as the key product resource as you build the product, this launch tracker\nwill be your launch reference.\nA lot of the work you\u2019ve done so far, from identifying your target customers\nto analyzing the competition to developing product messages for each\npersona, will inform your overall strategy and influence the decisions you\nmake within the GTM plan. Keep those in mind as you read this section!\nAt a high level, the GTM plan is subdivided into three sections: prelaunch,\nlaunch, and pos tlaunch. Let\u2019s look at each.<<<SECTION_BREAK>>>", "Prelaunch Planning\nThe main things to decide during prelaunch are the key launch goals, how\nyou\u2019ll make sure the product is ready for that launch, when and how you\u2019ll\nlaunch the product, and what assets you need to launch.\nLaunch Objectives\nLaunches have different purposes. For some products, like the latest Google\nPixel smartphone, the goal is likely to get as many customers as possible\nupgrading to this phone or new customers buying the phone. For enterprise\nsoftware like Salesforce, the goal might be getting a subset of customers\nengaged with a new feature. Sometimes the goal is simply awareness of a new\nfeature so that when customer enter their buying cycle, your product is on their\nmind.\nIdentifying your key goals up front will let you make other launch decisions,\nsuch as when to aim to launch your product.\nLaunch Timing\nAfter the launch objective, most launch teams identify when they want to\nlaunch the product. Sometimes this is a specific date, but usually it\u2019s a date\nrange. For example, consumer product launches tend to happen at the start of\nthe year, in late April/early May for the \u201cdads and grads\u201d window (Father\u2019s\nDay and graduation), or after the summer but before Black Friday.\nIt\u2019s important to pick this launch window as early as possible because it can\naffect your product\u2019s development. If you\u2019re selling a consumer product and\nthe development team thinks it will be ready to launch December 26, then\nyou\u2019ll have missed the entire window from Black Friday to Christmas, when\nconsumer products sell well. If you want to have the product available for\nholiday shopping, you\u2019ll need to reduce your product\u2019s scope to have it ready", "in time.\nBusinesses sometimes have buying periods, too, that you might need to time\nyour launch around. Schools often purchase products in the spring and\nsummer, before the start of the next school year. Sometimes companies have\nextra money in their budget they need to spend before the end of the year, so\nthey\u2019ll buy more in December. Understanding your customers and their buying\nhabits will help you identify the best launch window for your product.\nFor feature releases for existing products, the launch timing depends on the\nlaunch type and goal. If it\u2019s a big update that will encourage new customers to\nbuy your product, then you\u2019ll likely treat it like a new product and align the\nrelease with your customers\u2019 buying habits. Smaller releases\u2019 timing varies a\nlot. The only rule of thumb for these smaller releases is to release earlier in\nthe week so that if any support issues arise your team doesn\u2019t have to work\nover the weekend to resolve them.\nIf the feature is a bug fix for a critical security issue, then your launch goal is\nto get this into as many customers\u2019 hands as possible, as soon as possible. If\nit\u2019s a small update designed to improve the product for existing customers,\nyour goal will also be to get as many existing customers as possible to update,\nbut it\u2019s not as urgent. If your customer has to explicitly take an inconvenient\naction to upgrade, like restarting a computer, you\u2019ll want to schedule your\nreleases to balance the value of the release with the inconvenience of\nupgrading. Fortunately, newer tools like the Mac App Store and the Windows\nStore are making upgrades easier for customers, automatically handling the\ninconvenient actions like restarting when customers are away from their\ncomputers.\nA common question is, What does launc h mean and how do you pick a date\nwhen you have an agile team, producing usable products at the end of each", "sprint or cycle? It depends! For small features and bug fixes, often companies\ndon\u2019t even bother with a launch plan, and just deploy the feature when it\u2019s\nready (just not on Friday). For larger releases, such as an important new\nfeature, the company might choose to deploy the code internally but not\nrelease it publicly until a certain date.\nScrum makes this easy because you will pick a sprint whose date aligns with\nyour launch window to be the release sprint. Velocity calculations and story\npoint estimations will give you a good idea about what work will be\navailable on that date. It\u2019s always smart to have the prerelease sprint be\ndevoted to any last-minute, launch-related tasks that come up, and during the\nprelaunch phase you can make sure that each sprint is on track towards\nrelease. During each launch team meeting, one discussion point will be, Is\neverything still on track product-wise? If you find the velocity dropping, you\nmight have to adjust your release plans.\nOnce you\u2019ve picked a possible launch date, you\u2019ll establish a work-back\nschedule to determine what tasks you need to do when in preparation for\nlaunch\u2014i.e., the week before launch, you\u2019ll do press briefings\u2014two weeks\nbefore, all video assets need to be ready\u2014and so on.<<<SECTION_BREAK>>>\nTesting\nAs part of getting ready to launch your product, it\u2019s important to put a plan\ntogether to test it with real customers so that you can make sure the product\nwill deliver on its success metrics. Generally, companies first do an internal\nrelease of a product. The goal is to make sure everything works as expected\nand to catch major bugs before showing the product to any external customers.\nNext, companies do a broader beta, where they open up the product to a\nsmall group of external customers. This might be via an exclusive invitation to", "the top contributors on your support forum or via some automatic opt-in.\nThe former is a better approach for bigger releases, where you have specific\nnew features you want customers to test. Creating a select group of customers\nto give early access is useful because it gives you a group of people who\nactively use your product, and they\u2019re the most likely to use the new features\nand to have valuable feedback. Early access also makes these customers feel\nspecial, and they\u2019ll often want to share that status with the world when your\nproduct is released. Specifically, this group often becomes product experts,\nproviding tips and support to other customers and advoc ating for your product\namong their peers.\nAutomatic opt-in is most common with web apps with a large number of\nusers, where you can enable the feature for a short period of time for 1% of\nyour customers and get valuable feedback. Automatic opt-in is fantastic\nbecause it gives you real data from real customers, likely exposing the\nproduct to far more customers than would manually opt in to a beta test. But it\nmakes it hard to keep the new product a secret, just look at how often people\nreport seeing new Facebook  features before there\u2019s an official announcement.\nAutomatic opt-in might also generate complaints or a temporary drop in your\nsuccess metrics, but that data will help you improve the product so it has a\nsuccessful launch. Many companies have built internal tools to allow for\nselective feature roll-out/testing, and LaunchDarkly has built a general-\npurpose tool that anyone can use.\nThe key to planning a beta is thinking about how perfect your launch needs to\nbe. If your product is a mobile app and new customers find it buggy, they\u2019re\ngoing to delete it and likely never reinstall it. Hardware is even less forgiving\nbecause a customer will return your product, and that costs you money to deal\nwith. Web apps tend to be very forgiving, as you can update them multiple", "times an hour without the customer having to do anything. Of course, if you\u2019re\nstrictly adhering to Lean methodology, you will do minimal if any testing and\njust keep releasing as fast as possible. But as we\u2019ve mentioned before, most\ncompanies take a hybrid approach, which means you\u2019ll have some type of\nbeta.\nYou will either own or be heavily involved in product testing. A few key\nthings will help you run a successful beta test:\nMake sure your beta group matches your target persona(s). This\nwill ensure that the people testing are the people you want to reach.\nTest your product messaging with any outreach you do. If you\nemail certain customers to invite them to the beta, include the product\nmessaging you think will make them want to use the product. It\u2019s also\npossible to A/B-test messages to the same persona so that you can test\nwhich message gets the most people to sign up for the beta.\nEnsure you have appropriate onboarding. Onboarding is the first\nexperience a customer has with your product or updated version. In\nthe shipping product and later betas, it\u2019s usually where you call out\nkey features and explain why they\u2019re useful and relevant. In a beta\ncontext, onboarding is extra important because it includes any specific\ntesting instructions, such as what part of the product to specifically\ntest or parts that you know don\u2019t work right yet. Sometimes an\nonboarding experience is as simple as a release-notes email with\ninstructions for installing the beta.\nHave feedback mechanisms in place. Make sure you have", "quantitative analytics tools in place to measure against your success\nmetrics and to capture any crash logs, provide a qualitative feedback\nmechanism like Qualaroo or UserVoice so that customers can tell you\nwhat they think and reach you with any issues, and follow up with\ncustomers to see what they think. Special beta forums can provide a\ngreat way for beta testers to interact, provide feedback, and help each\nother out. The key pieces of feedback to look for are the product\u2019s\ndiscoverability, engagement, repetition (people come back to use it),\nactual use cases, and any barriers to adoption.\nAssess your feedback and use it to inform launch decisions. Beta\ntests give you a chance to see if your product addresses customers\u2019\nneeds successfully, and help you meet your success metrics with a\nsmall group. This gives you useful data about things you\u2019ll want to\naddress before launch, like what bugs or other barriers to adoption\nmany customers encountered. Sometimes you\u2019ll find a feature isn\u2019t\ndiscoverable and you need to add a callout to it specifically, or an\nonboarding experience to walk customers through using it. Sometimes\nyou\u2019ll find something doesn\u2019t work as expected in the real world, and\nyou\u2019ll decide to remove the feature. Occasionally you\u2019ll find that the\nwhole product just isn\u2019t good and customers don\u2019t adopt it, and you\u2019ll\ncancel the launch. The most common result of a beta test is that you\nuse the results to make a few minor changes and bug fixes, and then\nyou do another beta test. After a couple of iterations with larger\nsample sizes in each, the product will be ready to launch.\nWhen putting together a GTM plan, establish when you want to run each\ntesting phase, what you\u2019re aiming to get out of each phase, and who will own", "it\u2014generally support or the PM will own the tests. Make sure to plan time to\nreact to feedback from the betas before launch.\nFor some products, you will also want to run stress tests with Engineering\nduring the prelaunch phase to make sure your technical capabilities can handle\nany demand. For example, some very popu lar products generate so much\ninterest that their web servers crash because of the sudden spike in visitors.\nIt\u2019s quite common to add a launch task for Engineering to scale up your virtual\nserver capacity during a launch window, until traffic has leveled off to a\npredictable level.<<<SECTION_BREAK>>>\nWhat Kind of Launch?\nThink about product launches you\u2019ve seen before. Sometimes you just notice a\nnew button appear in the UX with a pop-up tip telling you to check out\nsomething new. Other times you don\u2019t get anything done for a couple hours\nbecause you\u2019re watching an Apple or Google presentation, large events we\ncall \u201cbig-bang launches.\u201d\nIt\u2019s important to align the type of launch you do with the product\u2019s scope and\nyour capability. If you don\u2019t, your product might flop or even become the\npunchline to a joke. Back in 2011, a mobile app photo-sharing start-up called\nColor focused on big-bang announcements. It received $41 million in funding\nright off the bat, which was huge. Then it launched its app with big fanfare,\nbut there was a problem\u2014Color focused on sharing with nearby users, but\nmost people who downloaded Color found they were the only one using the\napp nearby and stoppe d using it. Color\u2019s poor testing prelaunch failed to\ndiscover this problem. Over the next few months, the company made changes\nto address these problems, but it had lost its momentum and the company shut\ndown in 2012. Put simply, the product wasn\u2019t ready, the company did a big-", "bang launch, people gave the product a shot and were disappointed, and Color\nnever got a second chance.\nAlternatively, look at products like Gmail. Google tested it internally and\nthen launched it with an invite-only beta. In addition to giving Google a\nchance to discover and fix problems before Gmail was huge, it created a\nfeeling of exclusivity and demand for the product.\nNow imagine that the new feature you\u2019re responsible for is adding a \u201cwatch\noffline\u201d button to YouTube\u2019s mobile app. While this could be a great feature,\nyou likely don\u2019t need a huge event to launch it. Instead, working with the press\nto get articles on various tech and media news sites and letting existing users\nknow about the feature either in-app or via direct communication could be\nsufficient to achieve your launch goals\u2014likely adoption in this case.\nSmall events can be another great way to effectively launch and reach key\ninfluencers. For example, if Sonos were launching a new speaker lineup, it\ncould do the following: rent a mansion, fill it with the Sonos speaker system,\ncater the event, invite key customers, partners, and members of the tech and\naudiophile press, and expect these influencers to write for outlets Sonos\ncustomers read.\nSometimes, you\u2019ll work with a product that a customer really needs to\nexperience to understand, especially if it\u2019s an expensive product. Would you\nbuy a car just based on a review, or would you want to test-drive it first? For\nthese products, you\u2019ll need a launch strategy that is very hands-on-focused,\nboth for the initial launch and with follow-up events that let customers try the\nproduct. The VR/AR (virtual reality/augmented reality) space is a great\nexample. The best way for people to understand why VR/AR is compelling is\nfor them to try it themselves. When HTC released its high-end Vive VR\nsystem, it had a traveling roadshow where customers could try the Vive in", "specially built trailers.\nThese are the key things to think about for your launch type:\nWhich personas care about this feature, and what customers do they\nmap to?\nHow will you reach new customers?\nHow do y ou reach existing customers?\nWhat\u2019s your launch objective, beyond reaching the right customers\neffectively?\nIf you have a new product or a significant new version of an existing product,\nyou\u2019ll want to reach new customers and existing customers, and a large event\nmight be appropriate. If you have a big new feature, a small event or a series\nof press briefings focused on reaching existing customers and some new\ncustomers is likely more appropriate. If it\u2019s a small new feature, then reaching\nexisting customers is more important than securing press coverage.\nFor a small company struggling for attention, successful launches can be\nhard. You might do everything perfectly, but if customers don\u2019t show up, it\ndoesn\u2019t matter. One simple approach is to build up an email list of interested\ncustomers prelaunch. A \u201ctell me more\u201d landing page for your product is a\nsimple way to capture email addresses. This ensures that you\u2019re reaching\npeople who are explicitly interested in your product.\nYou\u2019ll want to make sure your outreach methods match your capability. If\nyou have a sales person who manually sends email and makes calls, will he\nbe able to handle the volume if you want him to reach out to thousands of\ncustomers the day your product launches?\nMany smaller companies choose to work with a PR agency that has", "connections at various media outlets to help get coverage in places your target\npersonas look. That\u2019s another reason that knowing how your target customers\nfind information\u2014pa rt of the Business Model Canvas\u2014is important: it lets\nyou be efficient!\nOnce you\u2019ve picked how you want to launch, you\u2019ll align your launch\nplanning on delivering what you need to make that method successful.<<<SECTION_BREAK>>>\nLaunch Asset Planning\nNo matter how small of a launch event you\u2019re planning, the launch team will\nalways end up creating various assets to accompany the product launch. As\nthe product manager, you\u2019ll often have a hand in creating these launch assets,\neven though other people will handle the details. Specific launch assets to\nconsider include the following:\nWebsite updates. How will the product\u2019s page be updated on your\nwebsite?\nSupport documentation. What needs to be updated on your product\u2019s\nsupport page for the new version? Is there new training material to be\ncreated ahead of time?\nSample video/images. Do you need to create new screenshots for the\nApp Store or wherever you distribute the product?\nBlog posts and other social media material. What material do you\nwant to create for the product\u2019s launch on your company\u2019s blog/social\nmedia channels? These outlets are called owned media because you\ncontrol them, and you want to make sure they support your\nlaunch/company goals.", "Ads. Do you intend to have any advertising material with your product\nlaunch? If so, you\u2019ll need to create the media ahead of time.\nDemo plan. When company representatives are showing off the\nproduct, how will they demo the new product? Or if you\u2019re releasing\na new version/feature, how does it affect existing demo plans?\nDistribution review needs. Application stores like the App Store\noften require special reviewer logins or video demos so they can\nmake sure your app works as designed. Do you have to create\nanything for this process?\nInternal product FAQ. If you\u2019re planning on doing press briefings as\npart of the launch, it\u2019s also handy to create an internal product FAQ\nwith the questions you expect to get about the product from reporters.\nHaving clear, on-message answers to common questions, including\nany hard questions you might get, helps whomever is doing the press\nbriefings prepare effectively.\nSupport-team training materials. While the design, engineering, and\nproduct teams are likely quite familiar with the product when launch\ncomes around, the support teams might not be as familiar. Create\nmaterials for them with the most common problems customers will\nface, and the solutions. Use what you learned during your testing\nperiods to gauge the most likely problems. During and after launch,\nupdate these training materials with any new questions that arise.\nSales-team training materials. As with support, it\u2019s important to\ncreate materials for the sales team so that the reps clearly understand", "the value in the product. These materials should focus on\nunderstanding the key buyer personas and what the product offers for\nthem. For existing customers, be sure to provide migration information\nso that the sales team can help ensure smooth migrations.\nWhile not an explicit asset, make sure to work appropriately with any external\npartners so that they\u2019re not caught off guard by your launch. For example, with\nMoove r we\u2019d want to make sure the moving companies have been notified\nand helped test our messaging feature. We might even choose to launch the\nupdated web console with them quietly before launching the app to support a\nbeta test.<<<SECTION_BREAK>>>\nA Helpful Prelaunch Marketing Framework\nThere is a marketing framework that\u2019s very handy for the launch team to keep\nin mind as they determine how to launch a product. This framework, called\nthe 4Ps Framework, is a guide to making marketing decisions and a reminder\nof key decisions you have to make when launching a product. The Ps stand for\nproduct, price, promotion, and place. Let\u2019s dive into each.\nProduc t includes both the obvious parts of the product (what is it, who\u2019s it\nfor, what\u2019s the benefit?) along with the non-obvious. Non-obvious elements\ninclude the packaging, accessories, support, warranty, and return policy. A\nhelpful way to remember these non-obvious elements is that they\u2019re things the\ncustomer encounters after purchasing the product. For example, after you buy\nit, you unbox it. Or you buy an accessory. Or you have a problem and contact\nsupport.\nPrice refers to what you charge for\u2014bot h normal, everyday transactions and\nwith possible volume and sale discounts. Determining the right price can be", "quite complex, and it\u2019s influenced by your product goals and your desired\nbusiness model. Social games are often free to play to get as many people as\npossible downloading them, which enables a better social game. Then, ads\nhelp provide a small bit of income from each customer, and in-app purchases\nhelp generate revenue from engaged customers while also making the game\nbetter for them. Hardware pricing is commonly based on component pricing,\nbut sometimes companies use a razor/blade model and sell the core hardware\nat a loss, making money on software and accessories. As a product manager,\nyou\u2019ll often have input on the pricing strategy, as the price is influenced by\nyour product goals and has an impact on your success metrics and product\nplanning.\nThe next P is promotion. This is what we think of traditionally with\nmarketing: What will your press release be like? What ads will you create?\nHow will the sales team reach customers?\nFinally, we come to place. Where do your customers find your product for\nsale? Is it only on your website? Is it in specific stores, either virtual or\nphysical? The key here is to make sure the place lines up with where your\ntarget customers go to find products. Some customers don\u2019t feel safe buying\nfrom a no-name start-up\u2019s website, for example. They might be interested in\nyour product, but they\u2019ll hold off buying it until it\u2019s available on Amazon. Or\nperhaps customers expect your app to be on the Google Play store, and they\u2019ll\nlook for it there instead of in the Amazon app store. If you\u2019re not selling\nwhere your customers are, you\u2019ll miss out.<<<SECTION_BREAK>>>\nLaunch\nThe nice thing about planning thoroughly before launch is that during launch\nyou\u2019re mainly executing on your plan, which is relatively relaxing and even", "fun!\nProduct managers are often company spokespeople, and we recommend\nworking with your communication team to make sure you speak well and\nknow the key product messages. And of course, if you\u2019re speaking externally,\ntake care to look your best, wash your hands, trim your nails, and present a\nprofessional image.\nBack in the office, the engineering and support teams will want to watch to\nensure everything is functioning correctly and customers are receiving any aid\nthey need. You, as the PM, will also want to work with them to look for any\ncritical bugs you might have missed during your testing phase. Have a plan in\nplace with Engineering ahead of time to asses, fix, and release these bugs as\nneeded. But beyond that, you can take a breath and watch how your customers\nreact to your hard work.\nWe call the social media posts your customers write, reviews your product\nreceives, and articles the press writes about your product earned media\nbecause you don\u2019t control it nor did you pay for it. Earned media is very\nvaluable because it means people find your product worth writing about. Of\ncourse the risk is that they don\u2019t like it and the earned media isn\u2019t positive.\nFortunately, most people, especially professionals, usually choose not to\nwrite a review rather than writing something negative.<<<SECTION_BREAK>>>\nPostlaunch\nIn Chapter 9 we\u2019ll go into more detail for what you, the PM, will do\npostlaunch. Most of your work will be internally focused, assessing early\nresults and metrics and planning what\u2019s next. The marketing and sales teams\nwill focus on how to promote and sell the new, current version. We\u2019ll briefly\ndefine some terms you might hear when working with those teams.", "The Customer Life Cycle\nJust like we think about product funnels with analytics (covered back in\nChapter 3), marketing also thinks about funnels. Sort of. Product marketing has\nbecome complex enough that many people think about engaging with\ncustomers as a loop c alled the customer life cycle.\nCustomers often start their journey with the awareness, interest, and\nengagement phases. This simply means people know about your product and\nseek to learn more. Marketing teams often pay for display and social ads to\nget more customers at this part of the funnel. A display ad is the typical visual\nadvertisement we think of, such as an ad in a magazine or a banner ad. A\nsocial ad is an ad you pay for on a social network, whether it\u2019s a text ad on\nTwitter or an image on Instagram. What marketers love about online marketing\nis that it can be very targeted. Unlike a newspaper ad that lots of people see,\nonline ads can be shown only to 31-year-old women who are interested in\ncasual video games. This helps ensure your advertising reaches the right\npersonas!\nThe next life cycle phase is about getting people to trust your product will\ndeliver on its promise and to buy it\u2014offering money-back guarantees is a\ncommon technique here. It often includes seeking out peer opinions and doing\nresearch on the product, such as looking for reviews. Affiliate marketing can\nhelp move customers through these steps. Affiliate marketing is when a trusted\nsource receives a small payment for encouraging its audience to buy your\nproduct. Customers are happy because they now feel they can trust your\nproduct, affiliates are happy because they received a payment for their expert\nadvice, and your company\u2019s happy because you have a new customer.\nSometimes companies provide special deals for their affiliate partners, such\nas discount codes, which gives new customers even more incentive to", "purchase your product.\nThe last phases of the customer life cycle are about customer satisfaction\nand advoc acy. The ultimate goal of the customer life cycle is to have\ncustomers advoc ating for you. Word of mouth is one of the most important\nfactors in why people buy certain products, and it brings new customers into\nthe customer life cycle, making them aware of your product. While the support\nteam will play the largest role in this phase, ensuring customers have a\npositive experience, the marketing team will often also help with customer\nretention and loyalty so that they in turn recommend the product again. They\nmight do this by sending swag like T-shirts to customers or by sending special\noffers to get the customer to make another transaction. If you\u2019ve ever tried to\ncancel your cable, phone, or Internet service, you\u2019ve likely found yourself\ntalking to a person whose job is to do whatever it takes to retain you as a\ncustomer, such as offering you a fantastic deal.\nAs a customer moves through each phase, you\u2019ll need to make sure she sees\nthe appropriate messaging and material. You don\u2019t need to show a money-\nback guarantee\u2014which helps the trust phase\u2014when you\u2019re trying to just make\npeople aware of your product.\nThe different messaging is important when working with search engine\noptimization and marketing (SEO/SEM). This is an entire field, and we\u2019re not\ngoing to go into it in depth, but SEO refers to how you optimize your site so\nthat when people search for keywords, you\u2019re the relevant result. SEM is\nwhen you pay to have an ad for your website appear based on certain\nkeywords.<<<SECTION_BREAK>>>\nMarketing Cost Measurement Terms\nWith all of these approaches, there are a few key terms you should be aware", "of, as they sometimes come up during strategy meetings between product and\nmarketing:\nPay per impression (PPI): You pay for the ad whenever it\u2019s shown.\nImpression means \u201csomeone saw the ad.\u201d\nPay per click (PPC): You pay for the ad only when someone clicks\non it.\nPay per action (PPA): You pay only when the user achieves some\nfinal action, such as dow nloading your app.\nClick-through rate (CTR): The percentage of people who click on\nyour ad.\nCost per impression (CPI)/cost per thousand impressions (CPM):\nThis is how much you pay to have your ad shown once (CPI)\u2014more\ncommonly listed as the cost to have it shown 1,000 times (CPM). This\ncan be used to assess how effective a campaign is. It\u2019s simply the\nadvertising cost divided by the number of impressions.\nCost per click (CPC): This is the actual price you pay for each click\nin your PPC advertising. In bid-based systems like on Google and\nBing, this might be lower than the price you entered. For example, if\nyou placed the highest bid at $2/click, which means you\u2019d pay at most\n$2 for each click, the actual amount you\u2019ll pay is based on various\nfactors such as the closest competitor\u2019s bid and your ad quality. CPC\nis often used when there\u2019s a daily budget for running display and\nsearch ads. When you hit your budget, you stop running the ad for the", "day. As you\u2019d expect, CPC is often CPI divided by CTR.\nCustomer lifetime value (CLV/LTV): How much money do you\nexpect to make from this customer over the product\u2019s lifetime? This is\nuseful for determining how much to spend advertising to this customer.\nThe CLV should be greater than what you spend to acquire the\ncustomer. If you have to spend $100 on display and affiliate\npromotions to acquire a customer but only expect to make $20 on this\ncustomer, you\u2019ll have lost money.<<<SECTION_BREAK>>>\nMOOVER\u2019S GTM PLAN\nHere\u2019s a first pass at Moove r\u2019s GTM plan. The launch team will break these\ntasks down into explicit action items and assign them, and they might raise\nconcerns during launch for issues not listed here. But this should give you an\nunderstanding of how to start thinking about launching and marketing a\nproduct.\nKey message: Moove r takes the hassle out of planning a move.\nNew-feature message: Moover\u2019s new chat feature takes the hassle out of\ntalking with movers.\nPrelaunch\nHow we will test this internally? We\u2019ll ask for volunteers on various\nteams to help test the mobile app and web dashboard for 10 minutes\neach day over the course of two weeks. By using both aspects, they\ncan make sure everything goes through as they expected. Using the\nproduct for a few minutes each day is likely the most common use", "case. We\u2019ll also designate one person on the QA team to handle a\ndifferent fake company in the database so that she can test the \u201cmany\nclients/one response source\u201d system.\nHow will we test this externally? We will ship it and turn it on for a\nsmall group of customers with no special announcement and see how\nusage changes, if customers have problems, and more. It\u2019s tough to\ncreate a beta pool for moving customers because people move and\nthen don\u2019t do it again for a while. Letting customers try this feature\nalso means we\u2019ll have to roll out the web portal to our moving\ncompanies earlier, as they\u2019ll need to be able to answer messages.\nWe\u2019ll need to create training material for these companies and\nprovide support.\nHow will we launc h this? This is not a huge feature, so it doesn\u2019t\nneed much fanfare. However, because many people haven\u2019t heard of\nMoove r, we want to use this to help generate fresh articles about our\nproduct. We\u2019ll work with our PR firm to do a small press tour, and\nwe\u2019ll make sure the focus is on the core product message more than\nthis specific new feature. We\u2019ll need to come up with a sample demo\nflow for these briefings. Perhaps we can have a fake moving company\nthat automatically sends a series of replies on the back end so that it\nappears like you\u2019re having a real conversation with the company\nduring the press briefing.\nWhat assets do we need to create? We need training and support\nmaterials for our moving-company customers, updated screenshots\nand documentation for the website and app stores, and a blog post", "describing what\u2019s in this update.\nHow will we reach customers? We don\u2019t have frequently recurring\ncustomers, so reaching existing customers isn\u2019t a big concern. We can\ncontinue to promote Moove r in general on job boards like LinkedIn\n(given that after people get a new job, they often move).<<<SECTION_BREAK>>>\nLaunch\nThere should be very little to do during launch, aside from updating the\nwebsite with new product information and releasing the updated app.\nWe\u2019ll want to make sure our website can handle an increased visitor load,\nbut given how infrequently people move, we don\u2019t expect a huge uptick in\nsimultaneous active users in the app. Given we see an average of 1,000 users\nper day, we could start by assuming that each user sends two chats per day to\nevery moving company he has a bid from. There\u2019s an average of five bids per\nuser. This means we should be prepared to handle 1000 * 2 * 5, or 10,000\nchats per day, which isn\u2019t a huge number. We can adjust capacity as needed\nafter things level off.\nPostlaunch\nWe will continue to promote Moove r as normal, especially focusing on\ntargeted display and search ads. The general message is still the key message\nto promote, as our app awareness isn\u2019t at the point where it\u2019s worth\nadvertising specific features initially.\nWe\u2019ll want to watch how often people use the chat feature to make sure it\u2019s\nsufficiently discoverable and intuitive.\nFor many in your company, especially the sales, marketing, and support\nteams, postlaunch is when they really go to work. For you, this is the last", "major step in the product-development life cycle. Read on to learn how to\nfinish up the life cycle.<<<SECTION_BREAK>>>\n________ \nCHAPTER EIGHT TIP\nThis tip comes from an amazing produc t leader, Kirk Paulsen, SVP for\nMarketing at DxO. For more than a decade, Kirk directed worldwide\nproduc t marketing for all photo software and cloud-based services from\nApple\u2019s headqua rters in Cupertino. As an executive for start-ups Sonic and\nthen Spr uce, he helped launc h the world\u2019s first commercially available DVD\nencoding and authoring systems. Kirk was also one of the first technology\nexperts to introduc e the very concept of computer-based audio and video\nediting systems to the music and f ilm indus tries.\nASK THE DRI TO WHITEBOARD IT FOR YOU\nIn my experience at a certain fruit-named company, each of our software application releases typically\ninvolved dozens of new features and enhancements. For each launch, it was the PM\u2019s job to cull the\ncomplete list down to a half dozen or so top-level features (TLF) which represented the story of that\nparticular release. It was the responsibility of the PM to present the TLF to the broader marketing team,\nwhich included creative directors, copywriters, graphic designers, etc. It was absolutely essential that the\nmessage be clear, concise, and delivered with enthusiasm. Tell the story right, with clarity and passion,\nand the entire creative team would get engaged to do their very best work to help you showcase the\nproduct. Were the message to lack cohesion or come off as uninspired, the creative team could just as\neasily disengage, performing mediocre work at best, which would invariably result in the industry giving it\na collective yawn. The quickest way for a PM to lose the respect of engineering is to make the product", "sound boring or obscure. Conversely, one of the best ways for a PM to earn kudos from other teams is to\ntell the story in an articulate, engaging, and insightful manner.\nSo how exactly do you figure out how to succinctly and effectively communicate the solution that will\nmake the customer awesome? Simple: for each and every TLF ask the engineer or scientist most directly\nresponsible for that particular bit to explain it to you in detail, in layman\u2019s terms. The process requires you\nto search out the directly responsible individual (DRI) for that exact feature or technology. In some\ncases, particularly with small start-ups, it may the founder. Often it\u2019s the product\u2019s chief architect who\ndirects the engineering team. In a Fortune 100 company, it might well be a shy but brilliant scientist who\nworks within one tiny team among a vast R&D organization. What I can assure you is, it isn\u2019t someone\nwho is somewhat close to the feature but not directly involved. Rather, it must be the DRI, the person\nwho coded, engineered, designed, or directed the work that led to that particular feature. At Sonic\nSolutions it was Dr. Andy Moorer, at Apple it was usually Randy Ubillos, and at DxO it is often Dr.\nFr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Guichard.\nWhen you take the time to identify the precise DRI for that specific feature or technology, you\u2019ll\ndiscover that that person, and only that person, is capable of explaining it to you, in depth and with more\nclarity than you could possibly imagine. Most important, you will have the opportunity to feel firsthand\ntheir personal passion for the product, and gain a better understanding of the true benefit of the solution\nas they originally conceived of it. In my experience this process typically involved either a private one-on-\none session, or a very select gathering, but never a large group. And in my experience it always, always\ninvolved a whiteboard, because I\u2019ve never met an engineer or scientist who wasn\u2019t keen to express\nthemselves with an erasable marker. After listening carefully to their description of the feature or\ntechnology, it\u2019s essential for you to try to immediately channel their voice and repeat what you\u2019ve just\nlearned, as in, \u201cso, would I be correct in describing this as\u2026?\u201d The process, which involves focused\nlistening and detailed note-taking, may well require several interactions before you are in complete\nharmony with the DRI and are able to perfectly articulate, in layman\u2019s terms, the solution. Follow this tip\nand you as the PM will be properly equipped to tell a great story to the creative marketing team, who will\nhelp you share your message with the industry, media, channel partners, and your soon-to-be awesome\ncustomers.", "<<<SECTION_BREAK>>>Congratulations! You\u2019ve successfully shipped your product! Everything\u2019s\ndone, right? Well, you need to do three more things during this cycle: PARTY,\nself-assess the cycle, and create a recommendation for the next iteration.\nLet\u2019s look at these three in detail.\nCELEBRATE!\nIt\u2019s really important for team and company morale to celebrate even small\nwins. For instance, you might celebrate fixing a difficult bug by getting\ncupcakes (make sure to take dietary requirements like gluten/sugar-free into\naccount.) When you ship a major version of your product, you might take th", "core team out for a nice dinner. And when you ship something big, you might\nhelp organize a companywide celebration.\nThese celebrations provide a way for individual contributors to get\nrecognized for their work. Product managers are often the most visible\nrepresentatives for their products, even though they\u2019re not the ones designing\nit or doing the coding. It\u2019s important to give credit to the team for doing a\ngreat job so that each person feels important and like a part of something\nbigger. It\u2019s also a great way to build respect between you and the team\u2014on e\nof the easiest ways to lose your team\u2019s respect is to take credit for the team\u2019s\nwork.\nIf you\u2019re organizing a companywide celebration, as a PM you\u2019ll likely give\na quick speech. This is a great oppor tunity to recognize the core team,\nspecific others who have gone above  and beyond to help get the product\nlaunched, and any groups that contributed to it beyond the product\u2019s core\nteam. It\u2019s also really nice to have positive feedback from internal people\n(what\u2019d the CEO think?) and external people (press quotes, customer emails)\nto share. This feedback is extra validation that the team\u2019s work is being well\nreceived. If a launch wasn\u2019t well received, you should still recognize the\neffort that went into it, as you want the team to have a positive attitude when\nworking on the next iteration of the product.\nOrganizing small activities and celebrations while building the product can\nalso be very helpful for team morale. When the team hits a key milestone, you\nmight go on an outing to play mini-golf.\nIt will likely fall to you to organize these celebrations\u2014though your office\nmanager/HR team can help with companywide ones. Make sure to be\ncognizant of the importance of these celebrations, as it\u2019s easy to forget about\nthem with all the other things on a product manager\u2019s plate.", "<<<SECTION_BREAK>>>ASSESS HOW THINGS WENT\nUltimately what matters most to the company is what your customers think of\nthe product and if you achieve your success metrics, but it\u2019s important to look\nat how you got to the release. If you alienated everyone or made the product\nextremely hard to build, the people on your team likely won\u2019t want to work\non the next version and might even look for different jobs. Assessing how\nthings went ensures that you gather feedback, letting people feel their\nconcerns are heard, and think about how to do be tter in the next cycle.\nFor some people, assessing how things went during the development cycle\nis very difficult, personally. This is when you explicitly put yourself out there\nand ask for feedback, and you will get feedback, both positive and negative.\nDiscussion with Your Lead\nThe first part of getting feedback is to see what your lead thought of your\nwork. Was she happy with how you approached everything, or were there\nthings she\u2019d like you to try doing differently? Did she get positive feedback\nfrom other teams about you, or were other leads always complaining about\nyou? It\u2019s very useful to schedule a one-on-one meeting with your lead, if you\ndon\u2019t have regularly scheduled meetings, to check in and make sure\neverything is good. A way to start the conversation is by asking, \u201cCould you\ngive me feedback on how you feel this cycle went? I want to make sure I\u2019m\ndoing the best job possible.\u201d After all, we grow by working on our weak\nspots.\nTeam Postmortem\nThe other part of assessing how things went is to get the team\u2019s feedback, and\nan effective way to do this is with a postmortem meeting. There are a few", "different ways to run these meetings. We\u2019ll walk you through how to run one\nyourself with the core team. If you feel you had problems working with the\nteam, you might ask someone else to run the postmortem so you can be absent\nfrom the room to make the team feel comfortable speaking openly. Some\ncompanies have open-door postmortems, where anyone in the company can\ndrop in to hear about the process. You\u2019ll just have to pick what feels most\nappropriate for your situation.\nHere\u2019s how we like to run postmortems. Find a time where the product\u2019s\ncore team and the key stakeholders are available, and schedule a meeting for\nan hour or so. You\u2019ll want to try to create a relaxed and open atmosphere,\nwhich can mean anything from book ing the meeting room with the comfy\nchairs to providing food and alcoholic/non-alcoholic drinks for the team\u2014it\nvaries company to company. Just make sure you have a whiteboard or\nsomething to write on that everyone can see.\nSince this meeting is about feedback, all opinions are valid\u2014m ake sure you\ndon\u2019t put value judgments on what people say, especially if they give you\nnegative feedback. Divide the whiteboard into two columns: things you did\nwell, and things you wish went more smoothly. Start by asking everyone to\nsay what they think went well. After a bit, switch to the other list and ask for\nthings people wish had gone better. Bounce back and forth between the lists\nuntil you feel everyone\u2019s been heard.\nLast, take some time to discuss what you want to do differently and what\nyou want to keep the same during the next cycle. You should write down the\npostmortem notes somewhere, like on the product\u2019s wiki page, including the\nkey things you\u2019re committing to doing differently during the next cycle.\nPeriodically refer back to this list to make sure you\u2019re alleviating as much of\nthe process pain as you can while keeping the good t hings.<<<SECTION_BREAK>>>", "RECOMMENDING WHAT\u2019S NEXT\nAfter launch, it\u2019s time to start another iteration of the product-development\nlife cycle. However, there\u2019s a challenge. In an ideal world, you\u2019d have useful\ndata about how what you did during this iteration affected your success\nmetrics and goals. Unfortunately, it usually takes time to gather enough useful\ndata to see whether your changes worked. Your immediate next iteration will\nbe driven by your product roadmap (Chapter 2) and other approaches we\ncovered in Chapter 3. Then, after enough time has passed to gather useful\ndata from this iteration, you\u2019ll put this product into one of three high-level\nbuckets. Specifically, you\u2019ll recommend moving on to something else\nbecause this product/feature is good enough, iterating more on this product,\nor sunsetting this product.\nIf you\u2019ve achieved or surpassed your success-metric goals, then your\nrecommendation will likely be to move on to something else. Automatic\ncrash reporting can be very helpful here for mobile and desktop apps, as you\nmight uncover bugs affecting lots of customers that you want to fix before\nmoving on, even if you hit your success-metric goals.\nIf you\u2019re not hitting your goals, then you need to dig deeper to think about\nwhere and how you want to iterate. Running simple A/B tests with tools like\nOptimizely is a great way to quickly see if you can make any small changes\nto help you achieve your goals. Sometimes non-core-product changes, like\nthe wording on a website, can make a big difference. The marketing team\nwill likely be running a lot of A/B tests on the marketing website to see what\ngets the most customers buying/using your product.\nLooking at what your customers think is also important. Maybe you hit your\nrevenue goals by switching to a subscription payment model, but if your\ncustomers hate it and are looking for alternatives, your long-term success is", "in question. What\u2019s nice about releasing a product into the wild is that you\u2019ll\nsee product reviews, social media posts, and support tickets about the new\nproduct. Look through these, in addition to reviewing your metrics, to see\nwhat customers think.\nWe\u2019d recommend rereading Chapters 3 and 4, thinking about how to come\nup with your next oppor tunity hypothesis for an existing product/feature that\u2019s\nnot achieving its goals. Moove r, for example, might find that customers love\nand use the chat feature, but the company still is not hitting its goals. By\nleveraging the advice in Chapter 3 around asking why, we might conclude we\nhave a platform-growth problem to address next.\nYou might conclude that no reasonable amount of effort will make the\nproduct achieve your success-metric goals. Or maybe your company\u2019s\npriorities have shifted, and this product just doesn\u2019t fit with the overall\nstrategy anymore. Or maybe a technological development has made\nsomething much better for your customers possible, but creating that\n\u201csomething better\u201d will mean a completely different product and not an\nupgrade. In this case, your recommendation should be to end-of-life or\n\u201csunset\u201d the product.\nSunsetting a product simply means you\u2019ll stop doing active development on\nit, and customers should switch to something else. We won\u2019t go into this in\ndepth, but you usually don\u2019t just suddenly stop selling a product. It\u2019s\nimportant to have a window where customer support is still available for the\nproduct, time where customer data is still available so that customers can\nretrieve it for online products, and ideally a migration path to help customers\nmove to an alternative product. While it can be frustrating for loyal\ncustomers, sunsetting products isn\u2019t a bad thing, and companies do it all the\ntime. The trick is just to make sure you have a reasonable plan in place.", "In March 2013 Google announced it was going to discontinue its Reader\nRSS feed aggregator because fewer and fewer people were using it and the\ncompany wanted to focus on other products. Google gave customers four\nmonths to retrieve and move their data, and they showed customers how to\nuse Google Takeout to retrieve that data.\nIn another example, Apple retired its professional photo-management tool,\nAperture, in mid-2014. The company provided an update to make sure\nAperture worked on the upcoming version of OS X so that customers could\ncontinue to use it for at least another year. Apple also worked with its main\ncompetitor, Adobe , to ensure Adobe \u2019s professional photo-management tool,\nLightroom, had an \u201cImport from Aperture\u201d command to help customers\nmigrate their data.\nUltimately, whatever your recommendation is, this final step of the product-\ndevelopment life cycle feeds nicely into the first step we went over in\nChapter 3: deciding what you should do next. The key difference is that you\nstart by evaluating whether you\u2019re happy with what you just did, whether you\nneed to work on it more, or whether you need to sunset the product so that\nyou can focus on something else. And then you repeat and repeat and repeat.\n________ <<<SECTION_BREAK>>>\nCHAPTER NINE TIP\nOur final tip comes from Carlos Gonz\u00e1lez de Villaumbrosia, founde r and\nCEO of Produc t School. He has dedicated his entire career to bridging the", "gap between education and employment in tech. Carlos was inspired to\ncreate Produc t School based on his own experience when he had to learn\nhow to break into produc t manage ment the hard way.\nAs a good agile PM and lean entrepreneur, Carlos focused on tackling\nthat specific problem and built a very basic MVP to validate his solution.\nProduc t School started as a casual recurring meeting between Carlos and\nseven aspiring produc t manage rs in Starbucks around the Financ ial\nDistrict in San Francisco. In those meetings, Carlos would share his\nexperience and would even invite other PMs as guest speakers to share\ntheirs. The reaction was so positive that Carlos rented a room in a\ncoworking space, created the first version of the produc t manage ment\ncurriculum, taught the first 10 cohor ts to refine every detail related to\ndelighting his students, and make sure they were equipped with the right\ntools and k nowledge to bui ld produc ts and ge t PM jobs.\nIn just two years, Produc t School became the first tech business school in\nthe world. It currently offers produc t manage ment courses in San\nFrancisco, Silicon Valley, Los Angeles, and New York. All of its instructors\nare senior-level PMs at top companies such as Google, Facebook ,\nSnapc hat, Airbnb, P ayPal, American Express, and N etflix.\nThis piece of advice comes from the data and experience gained from\nworking w ith Produc t School\u2019s produc t manage ment students every day.\nHOW TO BREAK INTO PRODUCT MANAGEMENT\nI transitioned into product management from software engineering eight years ago, and I founded\nProduct School to teach others aspiring product managers do the same.\nThe main reason people make a career shift into product management is because they are interested\nin having more decision-making power on the product strategy of the company. I don\u2019t blame them; this\nis a big shift that will impact your long-term upside since you will stop being a specialist in one part of", "the process to become a generalist in all the parts involved in the process by leveraging other people\u2019s\ntalents. This approach will serve you well professionally and personally.\nThroughout my career, I have meet dozens of current product managers, and entrepreneurs and\ninvestors who worked as product managers in the past. They all shared the exact same problem about\nhow they didn\u2019t have proper training when they started their management careers in tech. Yes, it\u2019s true\nthat a lot of them earned MBAs or similar business-related degrees at top universities that provided\ndifferent skillets and access to networks that helped in the long term. But these business degrees aren\u2019t\nalways applicable to product management, nor do they teach you how to be a product manager. In fact,\nmost of today\u2019s product managers, whether they have MBAs or computer science degrees, had to learn\ntheir craft on the go because there wasn\u2019t any product management school that had a holistic view,\nincorporating business, engineering, and design, Fortunately, Product School fills that gap.\nHere are some examples of different career paths to break into product management. Keep in mind\nthat this list isn\u2019t complete:\nEngineer \u2192 Senior engineer \u2192 \nTechnical project or program manager/engineering manager \u2192 Product manager\nStartup founder \u2194 Product manager\nManagement consultant/investment banker \u2192 Product manager\nCustomer support \u2192 \nBusiness analyst/project manager or program manager \u2192 \nProduct manager\nMarketing \u2192 Product marketing \u2192 Product manager\nDesign \u2192 Product design \u2192 Product manager\nThe one thing all of these career paths have in common is that PMs don\u2019t start as PMs. They spend at\nleast a few years in a different role, develop a few key skills, and then transition into product. The three\ncritical skills I think you have to develop in order to get a job as a product manager are technical\nexpertise, domain expertise, and communication expertise. Let\u2019s look at these three.\nAs you\u2019ve learned from the previous chapters, even if you don\u2019t know how to code, it\u2019s critical for", "product managers to understand some of the engineering behind the products they\u2019re managing. This\nknowledge will help you communicate with designers and engineers, assess technical feasibility, and\nunderstand what the technical side of implementing a project.\nNext, especially for your first product management job, it\u2019s important to understand the domain you\u2019re\nworking within. As we discussed in Chapter 1, we\u2019ve found that when you get your first PM job, if you\nknow about the field you\u2019re working in, you will be able to spend your time focusing on how to be a\nproduct manager rather than learning the nuances, challenges, competitive landscape, and more of your\ndomain.\nFinally, something we don\u2019t cover in detail in this book is how critical great communication skills are to\nPMs. PMs have to communicate all the time, whether via email or presentation. In our Product School\nbootcamps, we spend multiple hours teaching students how to be great public speakers with plenty of\npractice. If you can\u2019t communicate, it doesn\u2019t matter how great of a PM you are because no one can\nunderstand you.\nBeyond Product School, there are a few specific things that will help you transition into product\nmanagement:\nBuild something. In class, our students work towards a final capstone project where they pick a\ncompany they\u2019d be qualified to work at, determine what feature that company should build next, and\ncreate a presentation explaining why the company should build it next and the key requirements. Try\ndoing this on your own! If you know how to code, take a project from start to finish so that you can\nexperience shipping a product and getting feedback from customers.\nAttend hackathons. Check out product hackathons such as ProtoHack or StartupWeekend to get\nhands-on experience building a product in high-pressure environments.\nFind a mentor. Reach out to PMs you respect and who you feel could be good mentors to you.\nProduct School has an active Slack community, product-school, which is a great place to find a mentor.\nA mentor can provide war stories and help you understand best practices.\nNetwork. Check out product events in your city. Websites like Meetup and Eventbrite often feature\nevents. These events can be a great place to find a mentor, too.\nRead. The Further Reading list at the back of this book has great resources to help you learn more\nabout being a PM. We\u2019d highly recommend you check out Cracking the PM Interview by Gayle\nLaakmann McDowell or Decode and Conquer by Lewis C. Lin to understand what PM interviews\ninvolve.", "Apply to associate product manager (APM) programs. Some big tech companies such as\nGoogle, Yahoo, and Facebook have entry-level APM roles for new college graduates, where they teach\nyou how to be a PM on the job. You might qualify to apply.\nOne of the most common mistakes in landing your first PM job is setting your expectations too high,\neither in terms of your title or your company. Just because you are a senior software engineer now does\nnot mean your first PM job will be as a senior product manager. Similarly, your current company might\nnot be your dream company, but if there\u2019s an opening for a PM, you likely have a better chance landing\nthat as your first PM job than getting a job elsewhere.\nBe realistic! Asses your current expertise and map out realistic career paths inside or outside your\ncurrent company. Your ideal PM job will likely not be your first PM job, but that\u2019s OK. As long as your\nfirst PM job is relevant to your career goals and you\u2019re surrounded by more senior people that you learn\nfrom, it will still be a great job.\nNOW GO BUILD AWESOME\nPRODUCTS!<<<SECTION_BREAK>>>", "Chapter 1\nBalez, Mat.
